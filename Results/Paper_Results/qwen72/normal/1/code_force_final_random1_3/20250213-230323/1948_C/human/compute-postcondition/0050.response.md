The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 each time it runs.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 2 (as specified in the loop's step), making `i` equal to 5. Additionally, for the loop condition to still hold (`i < n`), `n` must be greater than 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5.**
