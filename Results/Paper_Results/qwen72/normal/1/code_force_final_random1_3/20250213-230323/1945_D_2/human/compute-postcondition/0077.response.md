Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, where `v` is `na_frente - 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `best` remains the same, but it is not executed in this snippet.
