Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the provided solution does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, the algorithm does not consider the optimal way to minimize the cost while ensuring Kirill reaches a position within the first `m` positions. The current approach seems to accumulate costs in a linear fashion without properly evaluating the best possible moves Kirill can make to minimize the total cost.

A more appropriate approach would involve dynamic programming or a priority queue to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each position, considering both the cost to swap with the person at the target position and the cumulative cost to pass through intermediate positions.

Here's a brief outline of a more correct approach:
1. Use a priority queue to keep track of the minimum cost to move to a position.
2. For each position, calculate the cost to move to that position from the current position.
3. Update the total cost and the best possible cost to reach a position within the first `m` positions.
4. Ensure that the algorithm correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.

The provided solution does not implement this kind of optimal strategy, leading to incorrect results in many cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
