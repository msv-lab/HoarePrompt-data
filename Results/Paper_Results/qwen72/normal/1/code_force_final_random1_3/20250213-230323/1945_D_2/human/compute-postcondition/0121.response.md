The only objects in the loop head are variables `v`, `na_frente`, and the range parameters. The loop iterates backward from `na_frente` down to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `v` was `na_frente`, and for the loop to execute again, `v` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than or equal to 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2
- `c` is 2
- `na_frente` is the first input integer minus 1 and must be at least 0
- `pos_final` is the second input integer minus 1
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input
- `v` is `na_frente`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `v` must be decremented by 1, so `v` is now `na_frente - 1`
- `na_frente` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head
- The loop will continue as long as `v` is greater than or equal to 0

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first input integer minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`**
