Based on the initial state and the provided code snippet:

- Initial State: `custos` is a list containing at least two elements.
- Code Snippet: `print(c)`

The variable `c` is not defined in the initial state or within the code snippet. Therefore, it is not clear what `c` refers to. Since `c` is not defined, attempting to print `c` will result in a `NameError`.

Output: **NameError: name 'c' is not defined**
