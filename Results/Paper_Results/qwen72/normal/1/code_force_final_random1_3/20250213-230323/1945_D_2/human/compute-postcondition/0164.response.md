Output State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is the last string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The list `b` remains the same as it was initially, containing the strings obtained from the new input split by spaces.
- The variable `y` holds the value of the last string in `b`.
- The list `b_values` now contains the integer values of all the strings in `b`, meaning each string in `b` has been converted to an integer and appended to `b_values`.
