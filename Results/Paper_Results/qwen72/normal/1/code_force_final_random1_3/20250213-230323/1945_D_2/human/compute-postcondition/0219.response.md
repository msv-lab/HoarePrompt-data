Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes the number of people in a queue (`n`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`m`), and two lists of integers (`a` and `b`) representing the costs to bribe individuals in the queue. It calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position not exceeding `m` by bribing people, using the costs defined in `a` and `b`. The function prints the minimum cost for each test case. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the results to the standard output. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the printed costs for each test case, and the input variables remain unchanged. **
