Output State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is the last string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p` plus `a_values[max_p - 1]`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2, `y` is `max_p - 1`, and `(a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y])` is greater than `a_values[y]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
