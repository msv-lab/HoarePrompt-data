The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a queue of people and the costs associated with bribing them. It calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than a specified maximum allowable position within the queue. For each test case, the function outputs the minimum cost required to achieve this goal. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value, and the final state includes the processed test cases and their respective minimum costs printed to the console.
