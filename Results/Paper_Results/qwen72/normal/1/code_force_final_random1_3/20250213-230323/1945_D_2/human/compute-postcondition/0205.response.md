The value of `custo` is incremented by the value at index `y` in the list `a_values`. The value of `y` is `max_p - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `max_p - 3`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `custo` is incremented by `a_values[max_p - 3]`.**
