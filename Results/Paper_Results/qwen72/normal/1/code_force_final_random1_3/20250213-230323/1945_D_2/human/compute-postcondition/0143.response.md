To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2.
   - `c` is 2.
   - `na_frente` is the first input integer minus 1 and must be at least 0.
   - `pos_final` is the second input integer minus 1.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input.
   - `v` is -1.
   - `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each value of `v` from `na_frente` down to 0.
   - `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered during the loop, where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `na_frente` and `pos_final` are derived from user inputs.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers.
   - `v` starts at -1 and is used to iterate over the lists.
   - `total` is calculated as the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each value of `v` from `na_frente` down to 0.
   - `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, but only considering values of `v` that are less than or equal to `pos_final`.

3. **Calculating `best`:**
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0.
   - For each `v`, it calculates `total` as the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
   - It then updates `best` with the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each valid `v`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(best)` statement will print the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered during the loop, where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

Given the complexity and the need to consider the specific values of the input lists, the exact numerical value of `best` cannot be determined without the actual input data. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated minimum cost.

Output: **best (where best is the lowest value of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] encountered during the loop, where v is less than or equal to pos_final)**
