Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people in a queue (n) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), along with two lists of integers (a_i and b_i) representing the costs associated with bribing individuals in the queue. For each test case, the function returns the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than m, or indicates if it is impossible to achieve this goal.**
