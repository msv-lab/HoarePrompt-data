The code snippet `custo += a_values[y]` updates the value of `custo` by adding the value of `a_values[y]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces.
- `y` is `num_fila - 3`.
- `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`.
- `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`.
- `custo` is increased by the value of either `a_values[num_fila - 2]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, or by the value of `b_values[num_fila - 2]` otherwise.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `custo` is updated by adding `a_values[y]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]`.**
