The provided code snippet appends the current value of `custo` to the list `custos`. This operation does not alter the value of `custo` itself but adds a new element to the list `custos`.

Given the initial state:
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces.
- `y` is 1.
- `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`.
- `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`.
- `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `custo` has been updated based on the conditions within the loop.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `custos` now includes the current value of `custo` as its last element.
- All other variables (`b`, `y`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `custo`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is 1, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2, `custo` remains the same, and `custos` now includes the current value of `custo` as its last element.**
