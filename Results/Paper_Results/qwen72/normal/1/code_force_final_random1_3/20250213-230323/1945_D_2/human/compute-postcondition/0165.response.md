To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `num_fila - 1` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`. This ensures that the range function generates a sequence of numbers.

2. **Initial Value of `y`**: The variable `y` is not used in the loop head but is mentioned in the state before the loop. However, since `y` is reassigned in each iteration of the loop, its initial value does not affect the loop's execution.

3. **Range Parameters**: The loop iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. For this to work, `num_fila - 1` must be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `num_fila - 1` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is the last string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`**
