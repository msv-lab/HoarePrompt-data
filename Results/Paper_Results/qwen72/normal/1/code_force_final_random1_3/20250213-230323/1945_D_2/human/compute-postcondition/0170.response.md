Postcondition: ***`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is the last string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`. If the integer value of `y` in `a_values` is less than the integer value of `y` in `b_values`, `custo` is increased by the integer value of `y` in `a_values`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`.***
