Output State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2] + a_values[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
