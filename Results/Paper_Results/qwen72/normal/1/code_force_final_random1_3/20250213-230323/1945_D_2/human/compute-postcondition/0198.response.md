Postcondition: ***`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, and `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, and `y` (which is `max_p - 2`) is equal to 1, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2] + a_values[0]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 2]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
