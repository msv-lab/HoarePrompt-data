The only variables in the loop head are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y` relative to `num_fila` and `max_p`. The loop iterates backward from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` (inclusive), decrementing `y` by 1 each time.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `y` is the last string in `b` (which is not directly relevant to the loop head).
- `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must still be within the valid range defined by `num_fila - 1` and `max_p - 1`. Since `y` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `y` will be `y - 1`.

Given that `y` was initially `num_fila - 1` and the loop condition is `y >= max_p - 1`, the next value of `y` will be `num_fila - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `custo` is increased by the appropriate value based on the previous iteration's conditions.**
