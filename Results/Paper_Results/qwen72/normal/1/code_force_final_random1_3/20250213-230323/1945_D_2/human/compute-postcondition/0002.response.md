The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The values of `t`, `cases`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer.**
