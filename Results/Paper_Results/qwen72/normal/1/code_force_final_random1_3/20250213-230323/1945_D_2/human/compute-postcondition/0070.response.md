The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `v` is equal to `na_frente`, and `total` was initially 0, the new value of `total` is now `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`, and `best` is 10^12. Additionally, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and the cost to change at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is greater than or equal to the cost to pass at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).**
