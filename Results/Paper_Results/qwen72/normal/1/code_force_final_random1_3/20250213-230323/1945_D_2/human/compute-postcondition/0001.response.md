To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `c` and `cases`.

- `c` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `cases - 1`.
- `cases` is the number of iterations the loop will perform, which is given as `t`.

For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `c` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `cases` is the same as `t`.

We need to ensure that `cases` is greater than 0 and `c` starts at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
