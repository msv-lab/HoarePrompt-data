The only objects in the loop head are the variable `y` and the list `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If `b` has at least 2 strings, the loop can execute again for the second string. At the end of the last iteration, `b` has at least 1 string, `y` is the first string in `b`, and `b_values` includes the integer value of `y`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must have at least 2 strings, and `y` will be the second string in `b`.
State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces and must have at least 2 strings, `y` is the second string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first string in `b` appended to it.**
