### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the input string `s` and stripping any leading/trailing whitespace.
   - It then calls the function `func_2(s)` to process the string.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function initializes the length of the string `n` and an empty list `balance_info` to store information about each character in the string.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `s`, maintaining a running balance of the parentheses.
   - For each character, it creates a `BalanceInfo` object with the current balance, position, and character, and appends it to the `balance_info` list.
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented; if it is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - After the loop, the `balance_info` list contains all the necessary information about each character in the string, and the final balance should be 0 because the input is a balanced parentheses sequence.

3. **Sorting the `balance_info` List:**
   - The `balance_info` list is sorted using a custom key. The key is a tuple `(x.balance, -x.position)`, which ensures that the list is sorted by balance in ascending order, and by position in descending order when balances are equal.
   - This sorting step correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

4. **Constructing and Printing the Result:**
   - The sorted `balance_info` list is used to construct the result string by joining the characters in the order they appear in the sorted list.
   - The result string is then printed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the input, processes the string, sorts the information, and constructs the result string accurately.
