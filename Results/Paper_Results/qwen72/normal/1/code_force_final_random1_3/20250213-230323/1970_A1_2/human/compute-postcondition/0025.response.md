Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It processes the string to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the balance, index, and character at each position in `s`. After sorting this list based on the balance and position, it constructs a new string from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints this new string, which is a rearranged version of the original balanced parentheses sequence. The function does not return any value. **
