The code snippet `balance += 1` increments the `balance` attribute of the `BalanceInfo` objects in the `balance_info` list by 1. Since all three `BalanceInfo` objects in the list have the same `balance` value, they will all be updated to reflect this increment.

Let's break down the changes:

- The initial `balance` value for each `BalanceInfo` object is 3 if the third character of `s` is '(', or -1 if the third character of `s` is ')'.
- After executing `balance += 1`, the `balance` value for each `BalanceInfo` object will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the new `balance` value will be:
- 4 if the third character of `s` is '(' (since 3 + 1 = 4).
- 0 if the third character of `s` is ')' (since -1 + 1 = 0).

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2; `balance_info` is a list containing three `BalanceInfo` objects, each with `i` set to 2, `s[i]` set to the third character of `s`, and `balance` set to 4 if the third character of `s` is '(', or set to 0 if the third character of `s` is ')'.**
