The value of `balance` in both `BalanceInfo` objects is decremented by 1. Since the initial `balance` value for both objects is either 2 (if the second character of `s` is '(') or 0 (if the second character of `s` is ')'), the new `balance` value will be 1 or -1, respectively.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1; `balance_info` is a list containing two elements, each a `BalanceInfo` object. The first `BalanceInfo` object has `i` set to 1, `s[i]` set to the second character of `s`, and `balance` set to 1 if the second character of `s` is '(', or set to -1 if the second character of `s` is ')'. The second `BalanceInfo` object has `i` set to 1, `s[i]` set to the second character of `s`, and `balance` set to the same value as the first `BalanceInfo` object's `balance`.**
