Based on the initial state:

- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `balance_info` is sorted by the `balance` attribute in ascending order, and within the same `balance`, by the `position` attribute in ascending order.
- `result` is equal to `s`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`, which is the same as the value of `s`.

Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the output will be the exact string `s`.

Output: **s (where s is a balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and its length does not exceed 500,000)**
