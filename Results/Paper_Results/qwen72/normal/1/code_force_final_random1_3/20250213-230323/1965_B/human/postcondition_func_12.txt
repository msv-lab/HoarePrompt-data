The function `func_13` takes two integers, `a` and `b` (where `b` is not zero), and returns a tuple of three integers. If `b` is zero, it returns the tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes a new tuple based on the results of `func_13(b, a % b)`, ultimately returning a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the elements from the recursive call. The function is designed to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, though the exact purpose and meaning of the returned values depend on the context in which the function is used.
