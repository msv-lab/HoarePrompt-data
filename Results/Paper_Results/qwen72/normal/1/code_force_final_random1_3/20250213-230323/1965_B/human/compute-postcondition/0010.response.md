To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`.
- `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
- `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and must be greater than 2.
- The current value of `k` is 1.
- `n` is not equal to 2.
- `ans` is `[2, 3, 4]`.
- `i` is 2.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(2, l):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `l` (exclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
- The loop condition is `i < l`. Therefore, `l` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- `l` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b` and must be greater than 3. The current value of `k` is 1. `n` is not equal to 2. `ans` is `[2, 3, 4]`. `i` is 3.**
