The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input (stdin) and returns an iterator of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the corresponding string from the input. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input line has been processed and an iterator of integers is available for further use.
