The function `func_14` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it implicitly works with two integers `n` and `k` under the constraints that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The function returns different outputs based on the values of `n` and `k`.

**Case_1:** If certain conditions (not specified in the function signature) are met, the function returns the string `'1\n2'`.

**Case_2:** Otherwise, the function generates a list `ans` based on the following rules:
- If `k` is 1, `ans` is a list of powers of 2 starting from 2^0 up to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
- If `k` is not 1, `ans` starts with powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.

The elements of `ans` are then converted to strings and joined by spaces to form the final output string.

Functionality: **The function implicitly works with two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n). It returns either the string '1\n2' or a space-separated string of numbers based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is 1, the string represents a sequence of powers of 2. If `k` is not 1, the string includes a more complex sequence involving powers of 2 and specific arithmetic operations on `k`.**
