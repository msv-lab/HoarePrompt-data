You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` takes four parameters: a dictionary `d` with integer keys and list values, a list `processing`, a positive integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It processes the elements in `d[da]` and updates the `rank` list based on recursive calls to itself. If `d[da]` contains only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates over the elements in `d[da]`, updating the `processing` list and recursively calling `func_12` for each unprocessed element. After the loop, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value found during the recursion plus 1, and returns this value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` takes two integers, `a` and `b` (where `b` is not zero), and returns a tuple of three integers. If `b` is zero, it returns the tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes a new tuple based on the results of `func_13(b, a % b)`, ultimately returning a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the elements from the recursive call. The function is designed to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, though the exact purpose and meaning of the returned values depend on the context in which the function is used.

If `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, and `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`. `i` is `l-1`. If `k` is not 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and now also includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1). `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2. `i` is `l-1`.

If `k` is not 1, `ans` starts with powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1).

These integers satisfy the conditions 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The function returns a string based on the following logic: If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` of integers. If `k` is 1, `ans` contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is not 1, `ans` starts with powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. The function finally returns a space-separated string of the elements in `ans`.

It writes the result of `func_14()` to the standard output, repeating this action a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. The function assumes that `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer. If `func_10()` returns 0, no output will be produced.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it constructs the sequence `ans` for the case when `k != 1`. Specifically, the part where it tries to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while ensuring that all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed as a subsequence sum.

Here's the problematic part of the code:

```python
for i in range(lk - 1):
    ans.append(2 ** i)
ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
ans.append(k + 1)
ans.append(2 * k + 1)
for i in range(lk, l):
    ans.append(2 ** i)
```

### Issues:
1. **Subsequence Sum Calculation**:
   - The code appends `2 ** i` for `i` in the range `[0, lk-1]`, which means it includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
   - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, which is intended to balance the sum to avoid forming `k`. However, this approach is not guaranteed to work for all cases, especially when `k` is large or when the sum of the powers of 2 already exceeds `k - 1`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases well. For example, if `k` is very close to `n`, the sequence might not be able to form all values from 1 to `n` excluding `k`.

### Example Case:
Consider the input `(n, k) = (10, 7)`:
- The code will generate the sequence: `[1, 2, 4, 7 - 1 - (1 + 2 + 4), 8, 16]`.
- Simplifying the sequence: `[1, 2, 4, 0, 8, 16]`.
- This sequence does not work because it includes `0`, which is not allowed, and it does not form all values from 1 to 10 except 7.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when constructing the sequence to avoid forming the sum `k` while ensuring all other values can be formed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
