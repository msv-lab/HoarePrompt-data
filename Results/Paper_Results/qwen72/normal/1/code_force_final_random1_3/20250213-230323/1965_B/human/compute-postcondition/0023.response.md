The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `lk`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `lk - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `lk` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. `k` is not equal to 1. `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is a list containing `[1, 2]`. `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 3, `i` is 2.**
