Output State: **The program returns a string where each element of the list `ans` is converted to a string and joined by spaces. The list `ans` contains specific elements based on the conditions: if `k` is 1, `ans` is a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is not 1, `ans` starts with powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1). Here, `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. The final string is a space-separated sequence of these values.**
