Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, and the value returned by `func_14()` has been written to the standard output the number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.**

This means that the loop will run as many times as the integer value returned by `func_10()`, and during each iteration, the value returned by `func_14()` will be printed to the standard output. After all iterations, the total number of times the value from `func_14()` has been printed will match the value returned by `func_10()`.
