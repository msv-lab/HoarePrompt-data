To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0.
- The value returned by `func_14()` has been written to the standard output twice.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer. The number of iterations is determined by the value returned by `func_10()`.
2. **State Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is the result of `func_10()`. The loop does not depend on any other state variables like `index` or `student` as seen in the previous examples.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` must have returned a value greater than 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a value greater than 0.
- The value returned by `func_14()` being written to the standard output twice does not affect the loop condition directly.

### Adjusted State:
- Since the loop condition depends solely on the value returned by `func_10()`, the state of `func_10()` must remain such that it returns a value greater than 0.
- The state of `func_14()` and its output does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, the value returned by `func_14()` has been written to the standard output twice.**
