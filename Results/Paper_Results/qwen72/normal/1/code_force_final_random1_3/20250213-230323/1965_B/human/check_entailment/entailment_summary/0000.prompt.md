Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    func_15()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single integer from standard input and returns this integer. After the function concludes, the program has read one integer from the standard input, and this integer is the return value of the function.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input (stdin) and returns an iterator of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the corresponding string from the input. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input line has been processed and an iterator of integers is available for further use.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line from standard input, splits the line into individual strings, converts each string into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a list of integers has been returned, which represents the integers converted from the input strings.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_3()` `rows_number` times. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input and returns this line with any trailing whitespace removed. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing newline character, decodes it from bytes to a string, and returns this string. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a single line of input has been read and processed, and the function has returned a string representation of this line without any trailing newline characters.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` reads a space-separated string of numbers from the user, converts each number into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers derived from the user input.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list containing the results of calling `func_7()` `rows` times. Each element in the returned list is the result of a separate call to `func_7()`. If `rows` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for input and returns the user's input as a string. After the function concludes, the program has obtained a string value from the user, which can be used for further processing.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user. After the function concludes, the program has returned an integer value based on user input.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits it by whitespace, and returns a list of the resulting strings. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of strings derived from the user input.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` takes four parameters: a dictionary `d` with integer keys and list values, a list `processing`, a positive integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It processes the elements in `d[da]` and updates the `rank` list based on recursive calls to itself. If `d[da]` contains only one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates over the elements in `d[da]`, updating the `processing` list and recursively calling `func_12` for each unprocessed element. After the loop, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value found during the recursion plus 1, and returns this value.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` takes two integers, `a` and `b` (where `b` is not zero), and returns a tuple of three integers. If `b` is zero, it returns the tuple `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes a new tuple based on the results of `func_13(b, a % b)`, ultimately returning a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the elements from the recursive call. The function is designed to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, though the exact purpose and meaning of the returned values depend on the context in which the function is used.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:
            return '1\n2'
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    else:
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes no explicit parameters but internally uses two integers `n` and `k` obtained from the function `func_7()`. These integers satisfy the conditions 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The function returns a string based on the following logic: If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` of integers. If `k` is 1, `ans` contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is not 1, `ans` starts with powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. The function finally returns a space-separated string of the elements in `ans`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It writes the result of `func_14()` to the standard output, repeating this action a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. The function assumes that `func_10()` returns a non-negative integer. If `func_10()` returns 0, no output will be produced.
