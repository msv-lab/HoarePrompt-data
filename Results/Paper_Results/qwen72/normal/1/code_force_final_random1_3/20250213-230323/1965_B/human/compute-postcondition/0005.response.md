The provided code snippet writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_14()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. Since the value returned by `func_14()` has already been written to the standard output twice according to the initial state, this code will write it a third time. The function `func_10()` returning a value greater than 0 remains unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, the value returned by `func_14()` has been written to the standard output three times.**
