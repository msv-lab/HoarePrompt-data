Output State: **The final state after the loop has executed all its iterations is as follows: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, with new values assigned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `l` is the length of the binary string `b`. `k` is not equal to 1. `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and now also includes `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1). `lk` is the length of the binary string `bk` and must be at least 2. `i` is l-1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `ans` will contain the initial elements (powers of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`), followed by the additional elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`, and finally the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1). The variable `i` will be equal to `l-1`, which is the last index of the loop's range. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, `lk`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
