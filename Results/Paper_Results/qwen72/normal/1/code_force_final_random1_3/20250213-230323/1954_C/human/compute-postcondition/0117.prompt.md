Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, x and y are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, list(input())))
    b = list(map(int, list(input())))
    new = [None] * len(a)
    new2 = [None] * len(a)
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    if i != len(a):
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
        while i < len(a):
            new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The list `new` will have the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`. The list `new2` will have the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, the list `new` will have the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` from the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` to the end of the list, and the list `new2` will have the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` from the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` to the end of the list. The variable `i` will be equal to the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` or the length of `a` if all elements are equal.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string such that `a[i] == b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the point where the loop stops. If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where `new[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the length of `a` - 1, and `new2` is a list where `new2[i]` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the length of `a` - 1, and `i` is equal to the length of `a`. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` and `new2` retain their previous definitions up to the point where the loop stopped.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is the index up to which `a` and `b` have matching elements or the length of `a` (whichever is smaller). If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, and `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new2[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`. If `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new[j]` is `min(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`, and `new2` is a list of integers with the same length as `a` where each element `new2[j]` is `max(a[j], b[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `len(a)-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
