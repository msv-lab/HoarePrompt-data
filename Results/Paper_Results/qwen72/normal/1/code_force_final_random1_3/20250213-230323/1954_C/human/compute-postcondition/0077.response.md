Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where \(1 \leq x, y < 10^{100}\), and each digit in `x` and `y` is from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string `x`.
- `b` is a new list of integers converted from the input string `y` such that `a[i] == b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the point where the loop stops.
- If `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where `new[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the length of `a` - 1.
- `new2` is a list where `new2[i]` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the length of `a` - 1.
- `i` is equal to the length of `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Conversion of Strings to Lists:**
   - `a` is a list of integers derived from the string `x`.
   - `b` is a list of integers derived from the string `y`.

2. **Comparison and Creation of `new2`:**
   - For each index `i` from 0 to the length of `a` - 1, `new2[i]` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of `new2` into a single string and prints it.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `x = "1234"` and `y = "5678"`.
- Then `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `b = [5, 6, 7, 8]`.
- `new2` will be `[max(1, 5), max(2, 6), max(3, 7), max(4, 8)]`, which is `[5, 6, 7, 8]`.
- The `print` statement will join these elements into a string: `'5678'`.

### General Case:
- For any given `x` and `y`, `new2` will contain the maximum values at each corresponding index of `a` and `b`.
- The `print` statement will join these maximum values into a single string and print it.

### Final Output:
Output: **The string formed by joining the maximum values of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`**. 

For example, if `x = "1234"` and `y = "5678"`, the output will be:
Output: **5678**.
