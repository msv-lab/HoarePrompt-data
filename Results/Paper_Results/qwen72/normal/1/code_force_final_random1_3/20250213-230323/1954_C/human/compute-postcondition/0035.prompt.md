Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The list `new` will have the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and the value at index `i` (where `a[i] != b[i]`) is now `max(a[i], b[i])`. The list `new2` will have the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`. The variable `i` is equal to the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` plus 1, and `i` is not equal to the length of `a`. The value of `new2[i-1]` is updated to `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The list `new` will have the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and the value at index `i` (where `a[i] != b[i]`) is now `max(a[i], b[i])`. The list `new2` will have the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`. The variable `i` is equal to the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` plus 2, and `i` is not equal to the length of `a`. The value of `new2[i-2]` is updated to `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`. The value of `new[i-1]` is updated to `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`. The value of `new2[i-1]` is updated to `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The list `new` will have the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and the value at index `i` (where `a[i] != b[i]`) is now `max(a[i], b[i])`. The list `new2` will have the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`. The variable `i` is equal to the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` plus 3, and `i` is not equal to the length of `a`. The value of `new2[i-2]` is updated to `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`. The value of `new[i-1]` is updated to `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`. The value of `new2[i-1]` is updated to `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`. The value of `new[i]` is updated to `min(a[i], b[i])`. The value of `new2[i]` is updated to `max(a[i], b[i])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is equal to the first index where `a[i] != b[i]` plus 4, and `i` is not equal to the length of `a`. `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The list `new` will have the maximum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`, and the value at index `i` (where `a[i] != b[i]`) is now `max(a[i], b[i])`. The list `new2` will have the minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]`. The value of `new2[i-3]` is updated to `min(a[i-3], b[i-3])`. The value of `new[i-2]` is updated to `min(a[i-2], b[i-2])`. The value of `new2[i-2]` is updated to `max(a[i-2], b[i-2])`. The value of `new[i-1]` is updated to `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`. The value of `new2[i-1]` is updated to `max(a[i-1], b[i-1])`. The value of `new[i]` is updated to `min(a[i], b[i])`. The value of `new2[i]` is updated to `max(a[i], b[i])`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
