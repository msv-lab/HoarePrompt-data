Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the digits in `a` and `b` are already in a way that maximizes the product without needing any swaps. For example, consider the input:

```
1
99
88
```

In this case, the maximum product is already achieved without any swaps, so the output should be:

```
99
88
```

However, the current implementation will incorrectly swap the digits, resulting in:

```
98
89
```

This is incorrect because the product of 99 and 88 (8712) is greater than the product of 98 and 89 (8722). Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct result for every potential case.
