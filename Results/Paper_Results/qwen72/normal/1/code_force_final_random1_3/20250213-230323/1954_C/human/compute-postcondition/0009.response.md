Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input, `b` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input, `new` is a list where `new[0]` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `new2` is a list of `None` with the same length as `a`, `i` is 1, `a[0] == b[0]`, `new2[0]` is `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
