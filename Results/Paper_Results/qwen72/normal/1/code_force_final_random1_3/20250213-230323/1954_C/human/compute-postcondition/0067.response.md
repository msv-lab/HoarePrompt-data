Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string such that `a[i] == b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the point where the loop stops, `new` is a list where `new[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the point where the loop stops, `new2` is a list where `new2[i]` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to the point where the loop stops, `i` is the index where the loop stopped plus 2, and `i` is not equal to the length of `a`, `new[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
