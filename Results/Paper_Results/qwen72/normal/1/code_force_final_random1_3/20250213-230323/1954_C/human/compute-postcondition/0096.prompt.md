Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is 0, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is 1, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is now `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is now `min(a[0], b[0])`, and `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is 2, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is now `max(a[0], b[0])` and `new[1]` which is now `max(a[1], b[1])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is now `min(a[0], b[0])`, `new2[1]` which is now `min(a[1], b[1])`, and `new2[1]` which is now `min(a[1], b[1])`, `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` remain strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in x and y is from 1 to 9, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a new list of integers converted from the new input string, `i` is 3, `new` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new[0]` which is now `max(a[0], b[0])`, `new[1]` which is now `max(a[1], b[1])`, and `new[2]` which is now `max(a[2], b[2])`, `new2` is a list of `None` values with the same length as `a` except `new2[0]` which is now `min(a[0], b[0])`, `new2[1]` which is now `min(a[1], b[1])`, and `new2[2]` which is now `min(a[2], b[2])`, `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`, `len(a)` must be greater than 2, and `a[2]` must be equal to `b[2]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
