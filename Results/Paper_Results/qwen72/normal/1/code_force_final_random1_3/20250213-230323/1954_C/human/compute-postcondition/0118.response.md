The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 ≤ x, y < 10^100, and each digit in `x` and `y` is from 1 to 9. The function returns the result of some operation involving these parameters.

Since the specific output is not provided, I will describe the general functionality based on the given parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `x` and `y` are strings representing large integers (each digit from 1 to 9) within the range 1 to 10^100. The function returns the result of an operation involving these parameters.**
