### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, which are converted into lists of digits.

2. **Initialization**: Two lists `new` and `new2` are initialized to store the resulting digits after the swaps. These lists are initially filled with `None`.

3. **Initial Matching Digits**: The function iterates through the digits of `a` and `b` from left to right. If the digits at the current position are the same, they are directly assigned to `new` and `new2` without swapping.

4. **First Mismatch**: When the first mismatch is found, the maximum of the two digits is assigned to `new` and the minimum to `new2`. This ensures that the larger digit is placed in `new` to maximize the product.

5. **Remaining Digits**: After the first mismatch, the remaining digits are swapped such that the smaller digit goes to `new` and the larger digit goes to `new2`. This is done to ensure that the product is maximized.

6. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the resulting numbers by joining the digits in `new` and `new2`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic correctly handles the case where digits are the same by keeping them as they are.
  - The logic correctly identifies the first mismatch and swaps the digits to maximize the product.
  - The logic correctly handles the remaining digits by ensuring the smaller digit goes to `new` and the larger digit goes to `new2`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the case where all digits are the same correctly.
  - The function handles the case where the numbers have different lengths by iterating up to the length of the shorter number (though this is not a concern as per the problem constraints).

- **Output Format**:
  - The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the resulting numbers for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
