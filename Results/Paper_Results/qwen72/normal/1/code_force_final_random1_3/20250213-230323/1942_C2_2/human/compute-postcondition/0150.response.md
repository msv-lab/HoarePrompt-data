Output State: **`x` must be at least 0, `c` is `i // 2`, `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers and must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `val`, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop plus `i` (now incremented by `i`), `y` is updated to `y - c` from the current iteration, `sx` is incremented by `y * 2`, `cons`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
