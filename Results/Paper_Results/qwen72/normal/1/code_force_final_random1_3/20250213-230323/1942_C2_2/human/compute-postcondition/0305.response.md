The function `func` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is an integer where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5).
- `y` is an integer where 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
- A list of `x` distinct integers, each within the range [1, n].

The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, along with a list of `x` distinct integers. The parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` have specific constraints, and the list of integers must be distinct and within a specified range. The function's exact return value is not specified.**
