Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `x - 1`, `tmp` is an empty list or contains one element, and `ans` is updated based on the conditions. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 1, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, `tmp` contains one element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. If none of these conditions are met, `ans` remains `x + y - 2`.***
