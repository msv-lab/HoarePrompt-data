The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least `x + 2` elements. `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `x + 1`, `tmp` is either an empty list or contains one element, and `ans` is increased by 1.**
