The code snippet appends a calculated value to the list `tmp`. This value is derived from the difference between the last element and the second-to-last element of the sorted list `a`, divided by 2 using integer division.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the new first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)
- `x` is the new second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5))
- `y` is the new third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x)
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements
- `tt` is greater than 2
- `ii` is 2
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `tmp` is an empty list

After executing the code:
- `tmp` now contains one element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Since `i` is `len(a) - 1`, this means the calculation is performed using the last two elements of the list `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the new second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the new third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]) // 2`.**
