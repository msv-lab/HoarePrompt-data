Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[x-1] - 1`, `ans` is `x - 2 + sum of all gaps in `odd` + 2 * (initial `y` - sum of (gap // 2) for all gaps in `odd`), `odd` is a sorted list of all the odd gaps greater than 1 found during the loop, `even` is a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 found during the loop.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `even` is a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 and must have at least one element, `gap` is the first element in `even`, `ans` is increased by `gap`, if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0, `ans` is increased by `2 * y`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `even` is a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 and must have at least two elements, `gap` is the second element in `even`, `ans` is increased by 6, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `even` is a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 and must have at least three elements, `gap` is the third element in `even`, `ans` is increased by `gap + 6`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is further increased by `6 - 2 * (gap // 2)`, `y` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
