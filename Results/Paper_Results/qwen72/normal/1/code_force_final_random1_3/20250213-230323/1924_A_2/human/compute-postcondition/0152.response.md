Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string.**

The code initializes `tmp` to an empty string, which does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the new value of `tmp`.
