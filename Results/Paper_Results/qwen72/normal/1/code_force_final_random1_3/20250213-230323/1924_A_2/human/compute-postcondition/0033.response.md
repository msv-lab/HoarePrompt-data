Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, and `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: This variable remains the same as it is the input string being processed.
- **`cnt`**: This variable increments each time the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is met, indicating that all `k` bits in `cur` were set to 1, and `cur` was reset to 0.
- **`ans`**: This variable accumulates the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0. Each time `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, the current character is added to `ans`, and `cur` is reset to 0.
- **`cur`**: This variable is a bitmask that tracks which characters (from 'a' to 'a' + `k` - 1) have been encountered. It is updated for each character in `s` and reset to 0 whenever it reaches `(1 << k) - 1`.

Thus, after the loop completes, `cnt` will hold the number of times the bitmask `cur` was fully set and reset, and `ans` will contain the characters that caused these resets. The final value of `cur` will be the bitmask representing the last set of characters encountered before the loop ended.
