Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = ''` sets the variable `ans` to an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping all other initial conditions intact.
