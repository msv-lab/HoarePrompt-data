Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed. Additionally, `cnt` is less than `n`.***
