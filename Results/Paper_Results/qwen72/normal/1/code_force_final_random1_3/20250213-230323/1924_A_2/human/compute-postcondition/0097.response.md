The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns to `tmp` the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is 1, `ord('a')` is 97, so `ord('a') + i` is 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'. Therefore, `tmp` is set to 'b'.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values specified in the initial state that are not altered by this code snippet remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` has been met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if the last iteration of the loop caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed but did not cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'b', and the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0.**
