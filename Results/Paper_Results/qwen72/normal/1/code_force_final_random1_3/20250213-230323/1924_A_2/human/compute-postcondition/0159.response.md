The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp` using the expression `chr(ord('a') + i)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the expression evaluates to `chr(ord('a') + 1)`, which results in the character `'b'`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'b', and the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0.**
