Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is initially 0, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss` and the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is now set (i.e., `cur & 1 << cur_ss != 0`). Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
