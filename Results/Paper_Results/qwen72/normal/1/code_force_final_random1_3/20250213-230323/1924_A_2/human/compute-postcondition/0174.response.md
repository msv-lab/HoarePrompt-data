Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` can be partitioned into `n` substrings such that each substring contains all `k` distinct characters. If it can, the function prints "YES". If it cannot, the function prints "NO" followed by a modified version of the string `s` that includes additional characters to meet the requirement. The function reads inputs from standard input and prints results to standard output. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
