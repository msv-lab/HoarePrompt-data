The value of `cur` is updated by adding the result of `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. Since `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `ss` minus 97, and the bit in `cur` corresponding to the position `cur_ss` was initially 0, the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is now set to 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is `1 << (ASCII value of the first character of `ss` - 97)`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `ss` minus 97.**
