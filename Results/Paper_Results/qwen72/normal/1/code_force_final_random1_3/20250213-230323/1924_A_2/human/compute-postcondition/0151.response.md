Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers.
- `s` is a new input string.
- `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop.
- `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`.
- `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.

Given this context, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **NO**
