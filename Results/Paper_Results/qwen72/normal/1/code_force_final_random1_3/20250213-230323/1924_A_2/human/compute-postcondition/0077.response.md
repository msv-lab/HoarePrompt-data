Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string with at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - 97`, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `1 << (ord(s[1]) - 97)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
