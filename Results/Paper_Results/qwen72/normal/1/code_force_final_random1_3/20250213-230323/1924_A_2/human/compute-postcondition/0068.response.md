Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string. If the bit corresponding to the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus 97 is not set in `cur`, then `cur` is updated to 1 << (`ord(s[0]) - 97`) and `cur_ss` is set to `ord(s[0]) - 97`. Otherwise, `cur` and `cur_ss` remain unchanged. Additionally, `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`.**
