Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from the new `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This changes the value of `cnt` from its initial state (which was the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution) to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
