The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by adding the result of `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. Here, `1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary number `1` left by `cur_ss` positions, which effectively sets the bit at position `cur_ss` to `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers
- `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character
- `cnt` is 0
- `ans` is an empty string
- `cur` is 0
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `ss` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a')
- The bit in `cur` corresponding to the position `cur_ss` is 0

After executing the code:
- `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss` because initially `cur` is 0, and adding `1 << cur_ss` to 0 results in `1 << cur_ss`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `ss` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'), and the bit in `cur` corresponding to the position `cur_ss` is now 1.**
