Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first character of `s`, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code snippet sets `cur` to 0, which overrides the previous value of `cur` (which was `1 << cur_ss`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
