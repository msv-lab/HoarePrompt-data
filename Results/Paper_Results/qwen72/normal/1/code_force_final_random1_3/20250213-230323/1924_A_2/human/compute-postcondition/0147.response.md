Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Depends on the final value of `cnt` after the loop. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` will be 2; otherwise, `i` will be `k + 1`.
- **`n`, `k`, `m`**: These input integers remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: The input string remains unchanged as it is only being iterated over.
- **`cnt`**: This variable increments each time `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`. It counts the number of times this condition is met.
- **`ans`**: This string accumulates characters from `s` that cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`. Each time `cur` reaches this value, the current character `ss` is appended to `ans`.
- **`cur`**: This variable is used to track the presence of characters in the current window of length `k`. It is reset to 0 each time it reaches `(1 << k) - 1`. At the end of the loop, `cur` will be 0 if it has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at least once, otherwise it will be the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed.
