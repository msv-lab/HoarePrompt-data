The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `m` respectively. This operation updates the values of these variables, while the other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `ans`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution
- `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0
- `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are updated to the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in `s`.**
