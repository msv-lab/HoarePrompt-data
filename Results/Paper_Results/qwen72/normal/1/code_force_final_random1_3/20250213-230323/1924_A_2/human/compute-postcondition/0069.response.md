Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - 97` if the bit corresponding to `ord(s[0]) - 97` was not set in `cur` initially, otherwise `cur_ss` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so `cnt` is now 1.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The value of `cur` is still `(1 << k) - 1`.
- The value of `cur_ss` is set to `ord(s[0]) - 97` if the bit corresponding to `ord(s[0]) - 97` was not set in `cur` initially. If the bit was already set, `cur_ss` remains unchanged.
