Reasoning:  
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cells to color such that at least `k` diagonals in an `n x n` grid contain at least one colored cell. The key insight is that each cell can affect up to 4 diagonals (two main diagonals and two anti-diagonals). However, to minimize the number of colored cells, we should focus on the fact that each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals effectively.

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `k` is equal to `4 * n - 2`, it means we need to cover all diagonals. In this case, the minimum number of cells required is `k // 2 + 1`. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, and we need one extra cell to ensure all diagonals are covered.
   - For other values of `k`, the minimum number of cells required is `ceil(k / 2)`. This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, and we need to round up to ensure that at least `k` diagonals are covered.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is equal to `4 * n - 2`. If true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2` correctly.
   - It also handles the general case where `k` is less than `4 * n - 2` correctly by using the ceiling function to ensure the minimum number of cells is calculated accurately.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle all specified cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
