The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, this condition is inherently satisfied. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized or adjusted.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed for the loop to execute is simply ensuring that `t` is within its defined range, which is already given.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration**
