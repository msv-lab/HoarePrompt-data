Functionality: **The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but operates under the constraints that for each of `t` test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), it deals with integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) representing the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should contain at least one colored cell, respectively. The function returns the result based on these constraints for each test case.**
