Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \) correctly. According to the problem description, if \( k = 4n - 2 \), the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is \( 2n - 1 \). However, the program prints \( k // 2 + 1 \), which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 10
```
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \). The correct output should be \( 2n - 1 = 5 \), but the program outputs \( 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \).

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not meet the requirements for this specific case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
