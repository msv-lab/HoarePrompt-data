The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `_` is within the range of `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must increment by 1, but since `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly tracked, the key state to consider is `t`. The loop will execute one more time if the current iteration count (implied by `_`) is less than `t`.

Since the specific value of `_` is not tracked, we assume it increments implicitly with each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than the current iteration count.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. If \(4 \times n - 2\) equals `k`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, \(4 \times n - 2\) does not equal `k`.**
