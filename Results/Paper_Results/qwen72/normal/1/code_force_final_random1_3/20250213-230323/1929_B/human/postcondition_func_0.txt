The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the size of a square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. The function then prints either `k // 2 + 1` if `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
