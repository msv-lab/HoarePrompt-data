Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from input.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

Explanation:
- `k` is an integer read from input.
- The expression `k / 2` divides `k` by 2, resulting in a floating-point number.
- The `ceil` function from the `math` module rounds this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
