The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration and is incremented by 1 at each iteration. The variable `t` represents the number of iterations the loop should perform, and it remains constant throughout the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `_`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration

After the previous iteration, `_` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the new state should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, and `k` is the second integer from the new input. If \(4 \times n - 2\) equals `k`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold true.**

Simplified:
State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are the same as before.**
