The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `arr`. The loop iterates from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr` has at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `len(arr) - 2`. Since the loop condition is `i >= 0`, `arr` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with at least one element, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, `tem` is equal to `arr[len(arr) - 1]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`**
