Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem statement at all. It includes several functions that perform various operations such as reading input, mapping strings to integers, sorting lists, and calculating products of elements in a list, but none of these functions are used to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation to the array.

To solve the given problem, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array and the array itself.
3. Determine the maximum frequency of any element in the array after adding a permutation.
4. Output the result for each test case.

The provided functions do not perform these steps, and thus the program is incorrect for the given problem.
