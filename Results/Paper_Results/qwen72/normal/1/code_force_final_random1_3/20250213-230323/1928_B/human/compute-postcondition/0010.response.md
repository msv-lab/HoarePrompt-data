Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers with at least 3 elements, `ans` is a list containing the last element of `arr` followed by `tem` and then `tem` again, `tem` is equal to `arr[len(arr) - 1] * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 3]`, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contained the last element of `arr` followed by `tem`. After the code executes, `ans` now contains the last element of `arr`, followed by `tem`, and then `tem` again. The values of `arr`, `tem`, and `i` remain unchanged.
