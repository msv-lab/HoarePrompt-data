The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the context, the `continue` statement would typically be used within a loop structure. Given the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but implies that the control flow moves to the next iteration of the loop (if inside a loop).

Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in the list, `resultats` is a list containing one element which is -1, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `total_points` is odd. We skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
