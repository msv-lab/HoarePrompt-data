Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in the list, `resultats` is a list containing the value -1, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, and `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. The `continue` statement has been executed, causing the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
