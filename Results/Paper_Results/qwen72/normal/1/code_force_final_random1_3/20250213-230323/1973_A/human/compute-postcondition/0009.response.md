The code snippet `resultats.append(-1)` adds the value `-1` to the list `resultats`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple.
- `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in the list.
- `resultats` is a list that may contain one element which is -1 if `total_points` is odd, otherwise `resultats` remains an empty list.
- `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
- `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`.
- `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `resultats` now contains the value `-1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in the list, `resultats` is a list containing the value -1, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, and `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`.**
