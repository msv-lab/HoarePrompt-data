Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by iterating over each test case and processing the scores `(p1, p2, p3)`.

2. **Total Points Check**: The function checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even. This is necessary because in a valid set of games, the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points for a win/loss or 2 points for a draw).

3. **Total Matches Check**: The function calculates the total number of matches as `total_points // 2`. It then checks if this number is greater than 3 or if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than the total number of matches. This ensures that the scores are feasible given the constraints of the game.

4. **Draw Calculation**: The function calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula attempts to account for the points that could have been distributed in draws. If `egalites` is negative, it means the scores are inconsistent, and the function appends `-1` to the results. Otherwise, it appends `egalites // 2`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases such as when no games were played (`0 0 0`) and when the scores are inconsistent (`1 1 10`).

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for calculating the number of draws. The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` might not always correctly account for the distribution of points in draws. For example, in the case `(3, 3, 3)`, the function should return `-1` because it is impossible to achieve these scores with valid games, but the current logic might incorrectly return a non-negative value.

Given the provided execution summary and the problem description, the function seems to handle most cases correctly, but there might be edge cases where the draw calculation logic needs refinement.

Correctness: **False** 

The function has a logical flaw in the draw calculation that could lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases.
