The code appends the value of `egalites // 2` to the list `resultats`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple.
- `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in the list.
- `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
- `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`.
- If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value -1, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
- Otherwise, `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
- Additionally, `egalites` is greater than or equal to 0.

The code snippet:
```python
resultats.append(egalites // 2)
```

Impact:
- The value `egalites // 2` is appended to the list `resultats`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the first tuple in the list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2`, `resultats` contains the value `egalites // 2` appended to its existing values, and `egalites` is greater than or equal to 0.**
