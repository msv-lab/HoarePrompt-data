You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. cas_de_test is a list of tuples, each containing three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. The list `cas_de_test` remains unchanged and contains `t` tuples, each with three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 ≤ `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ `p_3` ≤ 30). The list `resultats` will contain `t` elements, where each element corresponds to the result of processing one tuple from `cas_de_test`. For each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`, if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are odd, or if the total matches (`total_points // 2`) is greater than 3, or if `p3` is greater than the total matches, or if the number of ties (`egalites`) is negative, then `-1` is appended to `resultats`. Otherwise, the number of ties (`egalites // 2`) is appended to `resultats`.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list `resultats` containing `t` elements, where each element is either the number of ties (`egalites // 2`) or `-1` based on the conditions specified for each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in the list `cas_de_test`. Each tuple's result is determined by checking if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are odd, if the total matches (`total_points // 2`) is greater than 3, if `p3` is greater than the total matches, or if the number of ties (`egalites`) is negative. If any of these conditions are true, `-1` is appended; otherwise, the number of ties (`egalites // 2`) is appended.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, each containing three integers representing player scores. It returns a list `resultats` of length `t`, where each element is either the number of ties divided by 2 or -1, based on specific conditions related to the total points and the number of ties.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `resultats` containing `t` elements, where each element is either the number of ties (`egalites // 2`) or `-1` based on the conditions specified for each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in the list `cas_de_test`. Each tuple's result is determined by checking if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are odd, if the total matches (`total_points // 2`) is greater than 3, if `p3` is greater than the total matches, or if the number of ties (`egalites`) is negative. If any of these conditions are true, `-1` is appended; otherwise, the number of ties (`egalites // 2`) is appended.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
