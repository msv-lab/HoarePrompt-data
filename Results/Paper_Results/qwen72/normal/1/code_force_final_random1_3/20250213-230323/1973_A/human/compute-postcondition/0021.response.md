The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means no further changes are made to the variables within the current iteration. The values of `t`, `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, `resultats`, and `egalites` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(p1, p2, p3)` is the second tuple in the list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3` of the second tuple, `total_matchs` is equal to `total_points // 2` of the second tuple, if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing the value -1, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `egalites` is less than 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `egalites` is greater than or equal to 0, and `resultats` contains the value `egalites // 2` appended to its existing values, including the newly added -1.**
