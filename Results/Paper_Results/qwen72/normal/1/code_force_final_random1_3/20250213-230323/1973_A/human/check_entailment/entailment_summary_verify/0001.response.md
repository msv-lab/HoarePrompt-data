### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the final scores of three players, where \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
   - Each game can end in a win/loss (2 points for the winner, 0 for the loser) or a draw (1 point for each player).

2. **Total Points Calculation:**
   - The total points scored by all players must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (win/loss) or 2 points (draw).
   - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve the scores, so the function correctly returns -1.

3. **Total Matches Calculation:**
   - The total number of matches played is half the total points because each match contributes 2 points.
   - The function checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3, which is a reasonable constraint given that there are only 3 players. However, this check is overly restrictive. For example, if the scores are (3, 4, 5), the total points are 12, and the total matches are 6, which is valid but the function incorrectly returns -1.

4. **Calculating Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is \( \text{egalites} = \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (p3 - p2) - 2 \times (p3 - p1) \).
   - This formula accounts for the points contributed by wins and losses, and the remaining points should be due to draws.
   - If the number of draws is negative, it means the scores are not achievable, so the function correctly returns -1.

5. **Checking the Code:**
   - The code correctly checks if the total points are even.
   - It calculates the total number of matches and checks if it's feasible, but the check `if total_matchs > 3` is too restrictive and should be removed.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the derived formula and ensures it's non-negative.

### Conclusion:
The provided program has a logical error in the check `if total_matchs > 3`. This check is too restrictive and can lead to incorrect results for valid test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
