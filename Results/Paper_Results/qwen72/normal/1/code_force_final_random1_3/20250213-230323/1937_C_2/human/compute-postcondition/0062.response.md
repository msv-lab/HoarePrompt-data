Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` remains 1 if no such `i` exists where `res` was `<`, `best` is 0, `res` is the input string.** 

The variable `res` is now assigned the value of the user input, which is a string. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
