Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is irrelevant (will be set by the loop).
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is the last `i` for which `res` was `<` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `res` is the input string from the last iteration.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values of the variables and objects that are printed:

- `'?'`: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.
- `0`: This is a numeric literal and will be printed as is.
- `k`: According to the initial state, `k` is 1.
- `0`: Another numeric literal and will be printed as is.
- `i`: The value of `i` is described as "irrelevant (will be set by the loop)". Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine its precise value, but it will be whatever value `i` has at the time the print statement is executed.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 1 0 [i] (where [i] is the value of `i` at the time the print statement is executed)**
