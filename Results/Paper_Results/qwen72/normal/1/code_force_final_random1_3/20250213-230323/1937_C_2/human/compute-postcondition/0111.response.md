Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is determined by the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is not `<`, then `best` is 1.
  - Otherwise, `best` is 2.
- `res` is the input string from the user.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `k`**: `k` is explicitly given as 1.
2. **Value of `i`**: `i` is explicitly given as 3.
3. **Value of `best`**: The value of `best` depends on the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is not `<`, then `best` is 1.
   - If `res` is `<`, then `best` is 2.

Since the value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases:

- **Case 1**: If `res` is not `<` (e.g., `res` could be any string other than `<`), then `best` is 1.
- **Case 2**: If `res` is `<`, then `best` is 2.

### Output for Each Case:
- **Case 1**: If `res` is not `<`, then `best` is 1.
  - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 1 3`
- **Case 2**: If `res` is `<`, then `best` is 2.
  - The print statement will output: `? 1 2 1 3`

### Final Output:
Since the value of `res` is not specified, we need to account for both possibilities. However, the task requires a single output. Therefore, we will provide the most precise description based on the given information.

Output: **? 1 [best] 1 3 (where [best] is 1 if res is not `<`, otherwise [best] is 2)**
