The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` remains 1 if no such `i` exists where `res` was `<`, `res` is the input string. If `res` is `<`, `best` is 2. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.**
