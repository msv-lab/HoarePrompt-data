Initial State: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2

Let's break down the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

1. The first argument is the string `'?'`.
2. The second argument is the integer `0`.
3. The third argument is the variable `k`. Since `k` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value.
4. The fourth argument is the integer `0`.
5. The fifth argument is the variable `i`, which is explicitly defined as `2`.

The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately written to the console without any buffering.

Given this information, the `print` statement will output the following:

- The string `'?'`
- The integer `0`
- The value of `k` (which is unknown)
- The integer `0`
- The integer `2`

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 [k] 0 2 (where [k] is the value of the variable k)**
