Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, `best` is 2, `res` is a new input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `best`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects this assignment while keeping the initial conditions intact.
