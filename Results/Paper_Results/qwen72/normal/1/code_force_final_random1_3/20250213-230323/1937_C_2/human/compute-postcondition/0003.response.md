To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2 because the loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- `k` is 1.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2. The variable `i` will start at 2 as specified by the loop definition.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
