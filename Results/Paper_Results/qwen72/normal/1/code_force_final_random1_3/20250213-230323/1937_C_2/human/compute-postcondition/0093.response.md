Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `k` is 3 if `res` is `<`, otherwise `k` is `i`.
   - `best` is the last `i` for which `res` was `<` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `res` is the new input string from the user.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 4.
   - The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 3.
     - Otherwise, `k` is `i`, which is 4.
   - The value of `res` is not provided, so we need to consider both cases for `k`.

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `res` is `<`**
     - `k` is 3.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', 0, 3, 0, 4, flush=True)`
   - **Case 2: `res` is not `<`**
     - `k` is 4.
     - The print statement will be: `print('?', 0, 4, 0, 4, flush=True)`

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both possible outputs.

Output: **? 0 3 0 4 (if res is `<`) or ? 0 4 0 4 (if res is not `<`)**
