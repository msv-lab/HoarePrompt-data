Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `k` is 1 if `res` is `<`, otherwise `k` remains 1.
- `best` is 1 if `res` is `<`, otherwise `best` remains 0.
- `res` is the input string from the user.

### Analysis:
- The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- The value of `k` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` remains 1.
- The value of `best` also depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is `<`, then `best` is 1. Otherwise, `best` remains 0.
- The value of `res` is not specified, but it is an input string from the user.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

### Determining the Output:
- The first argument to the `print` function is the string `'?'`.
- The second argument is `k`, which is 1 regardless of the value of `res` (since `k` is 1 if `res` is `<` and remains 1 otherwise).
- The third argument is `best`, which is 1 if `res` is `<` and 0 otherwise.
- The fourth argument is `k` again, which is 1.
- The fifth argument is `i`, which is 2.

### Final Output:
The print statement will always print the string `'?'`, followed by the values of `k`, `best`, `k`, and `i`.

Output: **? 1 [best] 1 2 (where [best] is 1 if res is "<" and 0 otherwise)**
