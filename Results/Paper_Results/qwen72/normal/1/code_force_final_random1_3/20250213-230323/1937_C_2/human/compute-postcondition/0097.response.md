Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the last `i` for which `res` was `<` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `best` is the last `i` for which `res` was `<` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `res` is the input string from the last iteration.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged from the initial input.
- The value of `i` will be `n-1`, as the loop iterates from 2 up to `n-1`.
- The value of `k` will be the last value of `i` for which the condition `res == '<'` was true, or it will remain 1 if no such `i` exists.
- The value of `best` will be the last value of `i` for which `res` was `<`, or it will be 0 if no such `i` exists.
- The value of `res` will be the input string received during the last iteration of the loop.
