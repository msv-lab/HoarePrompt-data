You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an environment where it can interactively query a judge to compare bitwise OR results of elements from a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function must find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized, using no more than 3n queries. The input n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the index that resulted in the maximum bitwise OR when compared with 0, and `best` is the index that resulted in the maximum bitwise OR when compared with `k`. The variable `res` holds the last input string received from the judge.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function interacts with an environment that provides a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. It queries a judge to compare bitwise OR results of elements from this permutation, aiming to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized. The function uses no more than 3n queries to achieve this. After the function completes, it outputs the pair of indices (k, best) that result in the maximum bitwise XOR. The variables `n`, `k`, `best`, and `res` retain their final values from the last iteration, with `n` being the input integer, `k` and `best` being the indices found, and `res` holding the last response from the judge.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \(? a b c d\) to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - The goal is to find the maximum XOR value using these queries.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The algorithm starts by initializing \(k = 1\).
   - It iterates through the indices from 2 to \(n-1\) and compares \((p_0 \mid p_k)\) with \((p_0 \mid p_i)\) for each \(i\).
     - If \((p_0 \mid p_k) < (p_0 \mid p_i)\), it updates \(k\) to \(i\).
   - After finding the index \(k\) that maximizes \((p_0 \mid p_k)\), it initializes \(best = 0\).
   - It then iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares \((p_k \mid p_{best})\) with \((p_k \mid p_i)\) for each \(i\).
     - If \((p_k \mid p_{best}) < (p_k \mid p_i)\), it updates \(best\) to \(i\).
   - Finally, it prints the indices \(k\) and \(best\) as the answer.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The first loop finds the index \(k\) such that \((p_0 \mid p_k)\) is maximized.
   - The second loop finds the index \(best\) such that \((p_k \mid p_{best})\) is maximized.
   - By choosing \(k\) and \(best\) in this way, the algorithm ensures that the XOR value \(p_k \oplus p_{best}\) is likely to be one of the maximum possible values.
   - The number of queries used is \(2(n-1)\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(n = 2\), the algorithm will correctly find the only possible pair \((0, 1)\).
   - For larger \(n\), the algorithm will still work as intended by finding the indices that maximize the XOR value.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
