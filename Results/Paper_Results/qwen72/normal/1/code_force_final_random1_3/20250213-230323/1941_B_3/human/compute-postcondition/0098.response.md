The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.

Let's break down the initial state and the code to ensure we understand the context:

- `numTest` is incremented by 1.
- `stop` is `False`.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- The last element of `a` is no longer necessarily 0.
- The second-to-last element of `a` is no longer necessarily 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
- `i` is 1.
- `opNum` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `a[0]` is now `a[0] - opNum`.
- `a[1]` is now `a[1] - 2 * opNum`.
- `a[2]` is now `a[2] - opNum`.

Despite these changes to the variables and the list `a`, the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
