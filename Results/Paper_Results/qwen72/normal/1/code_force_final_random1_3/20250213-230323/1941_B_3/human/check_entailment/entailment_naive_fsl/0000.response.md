Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks the first and last elements of the array for certain conditions, but it does not consider the entire array. This can lead to incorrect results for arrays where the middle elements do not meet the required conditions for the operation to be applied successfully.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5
1 3 5 5 2
5
2 4 4 5 1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```

The program will output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

But for the third test case `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`, the program will output `YES`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `NO` because it is impossible to make all elements zero using the given operation. The program fails to correctly identify this case.
