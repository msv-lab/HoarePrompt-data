Output State: **`numTest` is incremented by 1, `stop` is `False`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, the last element of `a` is no longer necessarily 0, the second-to-last element of `a` is no longer necessarily 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 0, `opNum` is equal to `a[0]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - opNum`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - opNum`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
