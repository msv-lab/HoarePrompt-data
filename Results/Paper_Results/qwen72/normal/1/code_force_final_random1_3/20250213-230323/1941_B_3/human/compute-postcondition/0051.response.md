Postcondition: ***`t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[n-3]` is now 0, `a[n-2]` is now `a[n-2] - 2 * opNum`, `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - opNum`. If `a[i]` is less than 0, `stop` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.***
