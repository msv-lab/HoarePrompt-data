Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer for each test case such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `numTest` is the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(0, numTest):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    stop = False
    for i in range(0, n - 2):
        if a[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            stop = True
            break
        opNum = a[i]
        a[i] -= opNum
        a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
        a[i + 2] -= opNum
    if stop == True:
        continue
    if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` remains an input integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_j` has been modified according to the loop operations, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n-3]`, `a[n-3]` is now `a[n-3] - a[n-3]`, `a[n-2]` is now `a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-3]`, `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - a[n-3]`. If `stop` is True, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop because at least one `a[i]` was less than 0 during the loop execution. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration. Additionally, if `a[len(a) - 1]` is not 0 or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not 0, the condition holds as described in the if part. If both `a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]` are 0, the condition holds as described in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *After the loop has executed all its iterations, if `stop` is `True`, the state remains unchanged. If the last element of `a` is not 0 or the second-to-last element of `a` is not 0, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if both the last element and the second-to-last element of `a` are 0, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `numTest` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. If `stop` is `True`, it indicates that a negative value was encountered in `a`, and the loop stopped at that point. The array `a` is modified such that for each `i` from 0 to `n-3`, `a[i]` is reduced by `a[i]`, `a[i+1]` is reduced by `2 * a[i]`, and `a[i+2]` is reduced by `a[i]`. The final state of `a` reflects these modifications up to the point where a negative value was encountered. Additionally, either the last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is not 0, or the second-to-last element of `a` (`a[len(a) - 2]`) is not 0, or both the last two elements of `a` are 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
