Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `numTest` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `opNum` is `a[2]`, `a[n-3]` is 0, `a[n-2]` is `a[n-2] - 2 * a[0]`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - a[0]`, `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is `a[1] - 2 * a[0] - opNum`, `a[2]` is `a[2] - 3 * opNum`, `a[3]` is `a[3] - 3 * opNum`, `a[4]` is `a[4] - opNum`, `n` must be greater than 4. If `a[2]` is less than 0, `stop` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `stop` remains False.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` updates the value of `a[4]` by subtracting `opNum` from it.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
- The new value of `a[4]` is `a[4] - opNum`.
- The condition for `a[2]` being less than 0 and setting `stop` to True remains the same.
