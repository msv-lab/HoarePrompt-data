Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a series of test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function checks if it is possible to transform the list `a` such that all elements become zero through a specific set of operations. If any element in `a` is negative, or if the last two elements of `a` are not zero after the operations, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function processes each test case independently and does not retain any state between test cases. **
