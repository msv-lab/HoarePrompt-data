The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This value represents the number of iterations the loop will perform, which corresponds to the number of test cases `t` in the given state.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is greater than 0, which aligns with the given condition that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases, `_` is a placeholder, and the input value must be greater than 0**
