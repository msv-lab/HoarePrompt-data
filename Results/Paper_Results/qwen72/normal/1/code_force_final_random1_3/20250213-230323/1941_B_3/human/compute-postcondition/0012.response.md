The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement does not depend on the values of these variables.

Output: **YES**
