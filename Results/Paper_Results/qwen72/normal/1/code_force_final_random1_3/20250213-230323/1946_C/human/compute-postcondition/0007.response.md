Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree), `k` (a positive integer less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple `(v, u)` represents an edge between vertices `v` and `u`, with `1 ≤ v, u ≤ n`). The function returns the result of removing `k` edges from the tree, which could be a modified tree structure or a specific output based on the removal process.**
