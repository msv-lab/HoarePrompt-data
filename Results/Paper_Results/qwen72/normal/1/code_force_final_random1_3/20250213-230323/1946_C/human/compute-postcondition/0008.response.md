Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer from standard input, indicating the number of iterations to perform. It then calls the `solve` function that many times. The function itself does not directly accept any parameters or return any values. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged `n`, `k`, and `edges` variables, and the side effects of calling `solve` multiple times, which are not specified in the provided code. **
