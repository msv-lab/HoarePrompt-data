Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is a positive integer less than n representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (v, u) represents an edge between vertices v and u, with 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    solve()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(v, u)` represents an edge between vertices `v` and `u`, with `1 ≤ v, u ≤ n`. The function `solve()` has been called, and its effects on the state are unknown.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(v, u)` represents an edge between vertices `v` and `u`, with `1 ≤ v, u ≤ n`. The function `solve()` has been called, but its effects on the variables or any return value are not specified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a positive integer less than `n` representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(v, u)` represents an edge between vertices `v` and `u`, with `1 ≤ v, u ≤ n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
