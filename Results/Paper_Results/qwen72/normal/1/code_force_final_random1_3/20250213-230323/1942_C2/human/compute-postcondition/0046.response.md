Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `x - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing the middle points of all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose differences are even and where `y` was sufficient to cover the additional positions, `ans` is the final value after all the updates based on the conditions in the loop plus `y`.**
