Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` is a sorted list containing all gaps greater than 1 and odd encountered during the loop, `even` is a sorted list containing all positive even gaps encountered during the loop, `ans` is `x - 1` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` during the loop, `y` is now `y - sum(gap // 2 for gap in the updated `even`), and `a` is now sorted.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is `y - gap // 2`, `a` is a new list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the first element in `odd`, `odd` is a sorted list containing all gaps greater than 1 and odd encountered during the loop, `even` is a sorted list containing all positive even gaps encountered during the loop, `ans` is `x - 1` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` during the loop plus `2 * y` (which is now `2 * (y - gap // 2)`) plus `gap`, and `a` is now sorted. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, the current value of `y` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is `y - gap // 2`, `a` is a new list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `odd` is a sorted list containing all gaps greater than 1 and odd encountered during the loop, `even` is a sorted list containing all positive even gaps encountered during the loop, `ans` is `x - 1` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` during the loop plus `2 * (y - gap // 2)` plus `gap` plus `gap`, and `a` is now sorted. If `y < gap // 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `y` is `y - gap // 2`, `a` is a new list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in `odd`, `odd` is a sorted list containing all gaps greater than 1 and odd encountered during the loop, `even` is a sorted list containing all positive even gaps encountered during the loop, `ans` is `x - 1` plus the number of times `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st` during the loop plus `2 * (y - gap // 2)` plus `gap` plus `gap` plus `2 * y` if `y < gap // 2`, and `a` is now sorted. `ans` is increased by `gap`. If `y < gap // 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
