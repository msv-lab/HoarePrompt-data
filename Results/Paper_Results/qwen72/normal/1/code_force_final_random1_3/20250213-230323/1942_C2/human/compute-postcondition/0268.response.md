Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the next element in the `odd` list, `ans` is `x - 2 + gap + 2 * (y - (gap // 2))`, `odd` is a sorted list of all the odd gaps greater than 1 found during the loop and must contain at least one element, `even` is a sorted list of all the even gaps greater than 0 found during the loop, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
