Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a list that may contain some elements, `ans` is updated to `ans + 1`, the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is exactly 2.**
