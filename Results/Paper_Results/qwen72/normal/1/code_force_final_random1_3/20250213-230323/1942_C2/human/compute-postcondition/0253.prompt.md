Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 0, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is `x - 1`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is the last element in `even`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `ans` remains `x - 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
    gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
    if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
        odd.append(gap)
    elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
        even.append(gap)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is 0, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` is `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[0] - 1`, `ans` remains `x - 2`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` contains the value of `gap` and `even` is an empty list. If `gap` is less than or equal to 1 or even, `odd` is an empty list and `even` contains the value of `gap` if `gap` is even, otherwise `even` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[2]` if `x` is not 2, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[1] - 1`, `ans` remains `x - 2`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` contains the value of `gap` twice and `even` is an empty list. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap` and `odd` is an empty list. Otherwise, both `odd` and `even` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `y` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is `num - 1` for the original `num` in `a`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from the updated `a`, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `x` is 3, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[3]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`, `ans` remains `x - 2`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` contains the value of `gap` twice and `even` is an empty list. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` contains the value of `gap` and `odd` is an empty list. Otherwise, both `odd` and `even` are empty lists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
