Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `tt` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a list that may contain some elements, and `ans` is updated based on the conditions in the loop. The final value of `ans` will be `x + y - 2` plus the sum of all increments due to the conditions in the loop. The value of `y` will be reduced by the total of all subtractions due to the conditions in the loop. Additionally, the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is not equal to 2. The current value of `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, and the expression `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2` is equal to 0.**
