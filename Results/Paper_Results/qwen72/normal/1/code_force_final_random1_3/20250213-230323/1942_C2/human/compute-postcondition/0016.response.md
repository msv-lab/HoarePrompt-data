Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), the list of x integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `tmp` is an empty list. If the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is not 2, `ans` remains `x + y - 2`. Additionally, if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is even and `y` is greater than half of the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` minus 1, then `y` is updated to `y - ((a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1)`, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + (a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `tmp` is updated to contain one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.***
