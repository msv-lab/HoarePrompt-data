Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new first input integer (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the new second input integer (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5)), `y` is the new third input integer (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `tt` is greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing the middle points of even differences between consecutive elements in `a` that were less than or equal to `y`, and `ans` is the sum of `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with a difference of 2, plus the sum of the half-differences of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` with an even difference that were less than or equal to `y`. Additionally, the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is exactly 2.**
