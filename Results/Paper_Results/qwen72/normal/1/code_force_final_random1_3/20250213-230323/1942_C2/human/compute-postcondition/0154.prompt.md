Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` must be at least 0, `c` is the last calculated value of `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers, both in ascending order, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop, `i` is equal to `x`, and the values of `cons`, `y`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` must be at least 0, `c` is `i // 2`, `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers, both in ascending order, and must have at least one element, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop plus `i`. If `y` is less than `c`, `sx` is incremented by `y * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `cons`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. `y` is now `y - c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` must be at least 0, `c` is `i // 2`, `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers and must have at least one element, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop plus `i` (now incremented by `i`), `y` is updated to `y - c` from the current iteration, if `y < c`, `sx` is incremented by `y * 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `y` remains as `y - c` from the current iteration, and `cons`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` must be at least 0, `c` is `i // 2`, `val` is sorted with even numbers first followed by odd numbers and must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `val`, `sx` is the count of how many times `c` was equal to 1 during the loop plus `i` (now incremented by `i`), `y` is updated to `y - c` from the current iteration. If `y < c`, `sx` is incremented by `y * 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `y` remains as `y - c` from the current iteration, and `cons`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
