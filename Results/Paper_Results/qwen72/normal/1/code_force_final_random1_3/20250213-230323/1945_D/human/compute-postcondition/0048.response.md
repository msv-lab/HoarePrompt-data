To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `c` and `cases`.

1. **Current State**: 
   - `c` is 0.
   - `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `c` is less than `cases`.

3. **Adjustment**:
   - After the previous iteration, `c` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - `cases` remains the same, and it must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an input integer - 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed), `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` where `v <= pos_final`.**
