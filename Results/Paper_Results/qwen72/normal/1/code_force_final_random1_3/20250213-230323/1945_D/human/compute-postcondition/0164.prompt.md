Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces, `y` is the last string in `a`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all strings in `a`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `b_values` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custo` is 0, `custos` now includes the value of `custo`, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `x` must be greater than `i_last + 1`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for y in b:
    b_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces and must have at least 1 string, `y` is the first string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of `y` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces and must have at least 2 strings, `y` is the second string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first string in `b` and the integer value of the second string in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces and must have at least 3 strings, `y` is the third string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first string in `b`, the integer value of the second string in `b`, and the integer value of the third string in `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
