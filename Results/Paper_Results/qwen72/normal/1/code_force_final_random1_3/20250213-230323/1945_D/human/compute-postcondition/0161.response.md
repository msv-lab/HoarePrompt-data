The code snippet `b_values.append(int(y))` appends the integer value of the second string in the list `b` to the list `b_values`. 

Given the initial state:
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces and must have at least 2 strings.
- `y` is the second string in `b`.
- `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first string in `b` appended to it.

After executing the code:
- `b_values` will now include both the integer value of the first string in `b` and the integer value of the second string in `b`.

Output State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces and must have at least 2 strings, `y` is the second string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first string in `b` and the integer value of the second string in `b`.**
