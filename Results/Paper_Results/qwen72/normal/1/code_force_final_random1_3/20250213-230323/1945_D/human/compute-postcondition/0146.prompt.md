You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a_i and b_i are lists of integers of length n, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the person at position i and the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i, respectively. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for c in range(cases):
        na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
        
        custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        na_frente -= 1
        
        pos_final -= 1
        
        total = 0
        
        best = 10 ** 12
        
        for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
            if v <= pos_final:
                if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                    best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                    total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                else:
                    total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
            elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        
        print(best)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t`, `c` is `t-1`, `na_frente` is the last input integer - 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the last input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered during the loop, where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people in a queue (n) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), along with two lists of integers (a_i and b_i) representing the costs associated with bribing individuals in the queue. For each test case, the function returns the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than m, or indicates if it is impossible to achieve this goal.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
