Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first input integer minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v >= 0`, the loop will execute again.**
