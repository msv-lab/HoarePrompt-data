Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered when `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0, updating `v` each time.
- For each iteration, if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, the loop checks if the current `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `best` and updates `best` accordingly.
- The `total` is updated by adding the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration.
- After all iterations, `v` will be -1, `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs, and `best` will be the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered during the iterations where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
