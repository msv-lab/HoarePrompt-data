The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at index `v` from the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The value of `v` is `na_frente - 1`, which is `(first input integer - 1) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first input integer minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.**
