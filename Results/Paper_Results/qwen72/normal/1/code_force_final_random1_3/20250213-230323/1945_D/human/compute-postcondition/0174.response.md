Postcondition: ***`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, and `custo` is increased by the value of either `a_values[num_fila - 2]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, or by the value of `b_values[num_fila - 2]` otherwise.***
