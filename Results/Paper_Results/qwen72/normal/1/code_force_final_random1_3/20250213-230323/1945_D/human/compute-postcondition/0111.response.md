Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first input integer minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`.**
