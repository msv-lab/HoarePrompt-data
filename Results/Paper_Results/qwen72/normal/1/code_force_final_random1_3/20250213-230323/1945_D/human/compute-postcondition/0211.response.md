To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is `custos`.

According to the given state before the loop starts, `custos` will contain `x` elements after the loop completes all iterations. For the loop to execute, `custos` must be a non-empty list. Therefore, `custos` must have at least one element.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `custos`, and the state before the loop indicates that `custos` will eventually contain `x` elements, we need to ensure that `custos` is a list with at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`custos` is a list containing at least one element**
