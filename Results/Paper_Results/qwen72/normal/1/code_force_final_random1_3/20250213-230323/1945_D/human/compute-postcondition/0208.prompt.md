Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is the last string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, and `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is the last string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `y` is `max_p - 1`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`, plus the value of `b_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p` plus `a_values[max_p - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, and `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, and `y` (which is `max_p - 2`) is equal to 1, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2] + a_values[0]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 2]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is `max_p - 3`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, and `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 3]`. If `y` (which is `max_p - 3`) equals 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[max_p - 3]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
