You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a_i and b_i are lists of integers of length n, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the person at position i and the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    custos = []
    for i in range(x):
        custo = 0
        
        num_fila = 0
        
        max_p = 0
        
        a_values = []
        
        b_values = []
        
        nf = input().split()
        
        num_fila = int(nf[0])
        
        max_p = int(nf[1])
        
        a = input().split()
        
        b = input().split()
        
        for y in a:
            a_values.append(int(y))
        
        for y in b:
            b_values.append(int(y))
        
        for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
            if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
                custo += a_values[y]
            else:
                custo += b_values[y]
        
        for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
            if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
                custo += b_values[y]
                if y == 1:
                    custo += a_values[0]
                    break
            else:
                custo += a_values[y]
                break
        
        custos.append(custo)
        
    #State: After the loop completes all iterations, `custos` will contain `x` elements, each representing the total cost calculated for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variables `i`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, `nf`, `a`, and `b` will have been updated for each iteration but do not retain any specific values from the last iteration since they are re-initialized at the start of each loop. The variable `custo` will be reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and will hold the final cost for the current test case before being appended to `custos`.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: `custos` is a list containing `x` elements, where `x` is the number of test cases. Each element in `custos` represents the total cost calculated for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no direct parameters but reads from predefined inputs (likely global variables or input streams) that include multiple test cases. Each test case consists of integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function processes each test case to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position not exceeding `m` by bribing people in the queue, where the costs are defined by the lists `a` and `b`. The function returns the minimum cost for each test case.
