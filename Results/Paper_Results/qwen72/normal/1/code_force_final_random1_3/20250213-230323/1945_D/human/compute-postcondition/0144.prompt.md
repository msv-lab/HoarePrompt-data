Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a_i and b_i are lists of integers of length n, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the person at position i and the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i, respectively. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `cases` is an integer input by the user, which is the same as `t`.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = 10 ** 12
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer - 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed), `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` where `v <= pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered when `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first input integer minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each value of `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered during the loop, where `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
