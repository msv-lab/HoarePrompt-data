Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a_i and b_i are lists of integers of length n, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the person at position i and the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. x is an input integer. `custos` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    custo = 0
    num_fila = 0
    max_p = 0
    a_values = []
    b_values = []
    nf = input().split()
    num_fila = int(nf[0])
    max_p = int(nf[1])
    a = input().split()
    b = input().split()
    for y in a:
        a_values.append(int(y))
    for y in b:
        b_values.append(int(y))
    for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
        if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
            custo += a_values[y]
        else:
            custo += b_values[y]
    for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
        if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
            custo += b_values[y]
            if y == 1:
                custo += a_values[0]
                break
        else:
            custo += a_values[y]
            break
    custos.append(custo)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `custos` now contains the value of `custo`, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` remain integers within the range 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` remain lists of integers of length n with values in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `x` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `num_fila` remains the integer value of the first element in the list `nf` and is still greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` remains the integer value of the second element in the list `nf` and is at least 2, `a_values` remains a list containing the integer values of all elements in the list `a`, `b_values` remains a list containing the integer values of all elements in the list `b`, `nf` remains a list of strings from the input, `a` remains a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` remains a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces, `y` is 0, and `custo` is the final accumulated cost based on the conditions evaluated during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` remains a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces and must have `n` elements, `y` is 0, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `b` is an iterable that has been fully iterated over, `b_values` now includes the integer values of all elements in `b`, `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 1, `custo` will have been incremented based on the conditions within the loop, and `custos` now includes the value of `custo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is 1, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2, `custo` remains the same, and `custos` now includes the current value of `custo` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
