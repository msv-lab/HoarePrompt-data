The only objects in the loop head are the variable `y` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` contains at least one string, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `y` should be set to the first element of `a` for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces and must have at least 1 string, `y` is the first string in `a`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `b_values` is an empty list, `num_fila` is the integer value of the first element in `nf`, `max_p` is the integer value of the second element in `nf`, `custo` is 0, `custos` now includes the value of `custo`, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `x` must be greater than `i_last + 1`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces.**
