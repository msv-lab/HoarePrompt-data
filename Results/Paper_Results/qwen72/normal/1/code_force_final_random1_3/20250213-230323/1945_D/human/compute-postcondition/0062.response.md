The code snippet `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` adds the cost to change at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) to the current value of `total`. Since `total` was initially 0, the new value of `total` will be `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0
- `c` is 1
- `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0
- `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input
- `v` is `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`
- `total` is now `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`
- The cost to change at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`)

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and the cost to change at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).**
