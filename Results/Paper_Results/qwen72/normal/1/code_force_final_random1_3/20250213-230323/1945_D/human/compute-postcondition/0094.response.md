To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is 1.
   - `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0.
   - `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input.
   - `v` is -1.
   - `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0.
   - `best` is the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered when `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `na_frente` and `pos_final` are derived from user inputs, adjusted by subtracting 2.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers.
   - `v` starts at -1 and is used to index into these lists.
   - `total` is calculated by summing the minimum costs from `na_frente` down to 0.
   - `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for `v` ranging from -1 to `pos_final`.

3. **Calculating `best`:**
   - For each `v` from -1 to `pos_final`, calculate `total` as the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` down to 0.
   - For each `v`, compute `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
   - Track the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and store it in `best`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(best)` statement will output the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered during the iterations.

Given the complexity and the need to process input data, the exact numerical value of `best` cannot be determined without specific input values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated minimum cost.

Output: **best (where best is the lowest value of total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] encountered when v is less than or equal to pos_final)**
