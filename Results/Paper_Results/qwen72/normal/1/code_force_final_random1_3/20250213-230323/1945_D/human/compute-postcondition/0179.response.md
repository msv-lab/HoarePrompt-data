Output State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is the last string in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, and `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `custo` will have been incremented by the minimum value between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each index `y` starting from `num_fila - 1` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches `max_p`. The other variables (`b`, `y`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
