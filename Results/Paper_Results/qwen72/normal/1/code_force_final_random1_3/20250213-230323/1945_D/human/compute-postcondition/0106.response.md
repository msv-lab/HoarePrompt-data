Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first input integer minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `best` to be the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Since `total` is 0, `best` now equals `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
