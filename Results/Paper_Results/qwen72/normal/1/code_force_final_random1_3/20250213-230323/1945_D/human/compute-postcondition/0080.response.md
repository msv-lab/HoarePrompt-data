The value of `total` is updated by adding the value at index `v` of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The value of `v` is `na_frente - 1`, which means the index used is `na_frente - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0
- `c` is 1
- `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0
- `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input
- `v` is `na_frente - 1`

After executing the code:
- `total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first input integer - 2 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second input integer - 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`.**
