Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is the same as `t` and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer - 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. The value of `v` is calculated as `na_frente - 2`, and the value of `total` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
