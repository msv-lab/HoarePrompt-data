t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a_i and b_i are lists of integers of length n, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the person at position i and the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i, respectively. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
