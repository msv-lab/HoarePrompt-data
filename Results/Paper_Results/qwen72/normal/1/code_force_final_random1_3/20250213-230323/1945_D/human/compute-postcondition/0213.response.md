The only object in the loop head is the list `custos`, and the variable `c` which represents the current element being processed in each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the list `custos` to process. At the end of the last iteration, `custos` is a list containing at least one element. For the loop to execute again, `custos` must contain at least two elements.

State: **`custos` is a list containing at least two elements**
