Output State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the new input split by spaces, `y` is 1, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all strings in `b`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`, plus the value of `b_values[y]`, plus `a_values[0]`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to 2, the current value of `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `custo += a_values[0]` adds the value of `a_values[0]` to `custo`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `custo` now includes the additional value of `a_values[0]`.
