### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array of cells `arr`.

2. **String Conversion**: The array `arr` is converted to a string with no spaces using `''.join(input('').split())`. This ensures that the array is treated as a continuous string of '0's and '1's.

3. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' (the first chip).
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to the last occurrence of '1' in the original string.

4. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This substring will contain all the chips and possibly some free cells in between.

5. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the extracted substring. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The approach correctly identifies the first and last chip positions.
  - It then extracts the relevant substring containing all the chips and any free cells in between.
  - Counting the '0's in this substring gives the minimum number of moves required to form a single block of chips.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
