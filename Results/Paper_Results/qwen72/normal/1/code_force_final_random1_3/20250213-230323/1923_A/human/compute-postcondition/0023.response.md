The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the described parameter constraints and relationships, it implicitly accepts the following inputs:

- `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the number of cells.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing whether the cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). At least one cell contains a chip in each test case.

The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the description. Assuming the function is designed to solve a problem related to the chips in the cells, the most likely output would be some form of analysis or computation based on the positions of the chips.

Given the lack of explicit output details, I will assume the function returns a list of results, one for each test case, where each result could be a computed value or a status based on the configuration of the cells.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) representing the number of cells, and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 or 1) indicating whether each cell is free or contains a chip. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
