The code snippet `x = arr.find('1')` searches for the first occurrence of the character '1' in the string `arr` and assigns the index of this occurrence to the variable `x`. If '1' is not found in `arr`, `x` will be assigned the value `-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed

The output state will depend on whether '1' is present in `arr`:
- If '1' is found in `arr`, `x` will be the index of the first occurrence of '1'.
- If '1' is not found in `arr`, `x` will be `-1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found.**
