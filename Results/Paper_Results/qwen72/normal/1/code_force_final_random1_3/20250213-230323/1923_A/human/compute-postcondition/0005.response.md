The code snippet `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. This index is then assigned to `y`.

- `arr[::-1]` creates a reversed version of `arr`.
- `.find('1')` finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string.

If '1' is found, `y` will be the index of the first '1' in the reversed string. If '1' is not found, `y` will be `-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found

The output state will be:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]` or `-1` if '1' is not found

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]` or `-1` if '1' is not found.**
