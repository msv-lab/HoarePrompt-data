Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (this is not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `_` is 1 (this is also not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a string containing the new input with all spaces removed.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found.
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found.
- `z` is the substring of the new `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(z.count('0'))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and String Preparation:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a string with all spaces removed from the input.

2. **Finding Indices:**
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of `arr`.

3. **Substring Extraction:**
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.

4. **Counting '0's:**
   - The `print` statement will print the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

- Suppose the input string is `" 100101 "`.
- After removing spaces, `arr` becomes `"100101"`.
- `n` is the length of `arr`, which is 6.
- `x` is the index of the first '1' in `arr`, which is 0.
- The reversed string of `arr` is `"101001"`.
- `y` is the index of the first '1' in the reversed string, which is 0.
- `n - y - 1` is `6 - 0 - 1 = 5`.
- `z` is the substring of `arr` from index 0 to index 5, which is `"100101"`.

Now, `z.count('0')` will count the number of '0's in `"100101"`, which is 3.

### General Case:
- If `arr` does not contain any '1', both `x` and `y` will be `-1`, and the substring `z` will be empty, resulting in `z.count('0')` being 0.
- If `arr` contains at least one '1', `x` and `y` will be valid indices, and `z` will be a non-empty substring.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

Output: **z.count('0') (where z is the substring of arr starting from index x and ending at index n - y - 1)**
