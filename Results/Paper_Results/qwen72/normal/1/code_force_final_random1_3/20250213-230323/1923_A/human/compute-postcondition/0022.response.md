Output State: **_ is t-1, t is greater than or equal to 1, n is an input integer, arr is a string containing the final input with all spaces removed, x is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the final arr or -1 if '1' is not found, y is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the final arr or -1 if '1' is not found, z is the substring of the final arr starting from index x and ending at index n - y - 1.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the loop counter `_` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. The variable `t` remains greater than or equal to 1, as it was initially. For the last iteration, `n` is the final input integer, `arr` is the final input string with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first '1' in this final `arr`, `y` is the index of the first '1' in the reversed final `arr`, and `z` is the substring of the final `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`.
