You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1), representing cells that are either free (0) or contain a chip (1). For each test case, the function identifies the segment of the list that starts from the first cell containing a chip to the last cell containing a chip. It then counts the number of free cells (0s) within this segment and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array of cells `arr`.

2. **String Conversion**: The array `arr` is converted to a string with no spaces using `''.join(input('').split())`. This ensures that the array is treated as a continuous string of '0's and '1's.

3. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' (the first chip).
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to the last occurrence of '1' in the original string.

4. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This substring will contain all the chips and possibly some free cells in between.

5. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the extracted substring. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The approach correctly identifies the first and last chip positions.
  - It then extracts the relevant substring containing all the chips and any free cells in between.
  - Counting the '0's in this substring gives the minimum number of moves required to form a single block of chips.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
