The code snippet updates the value of `z` to be the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`. Let's break down the impact:

- `z` is reassigned to `arr[x:n - y]`.
- The value of `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found.
- The value of `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found.
- `n` is an input integer.
- The slicing operation `arr[x:n - y]` will extract the substring from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending just before index `n - y`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` remains 2.
- `t` remains greater than 1.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `arr` remains a string containing the new input with all spaces removed.
- `x` remains the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found.
- `y` remains the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found.

The only variable that changes is `z`, which is now the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the new input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string of the new `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**
