Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string containing the input with all spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]` or `-1` if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
