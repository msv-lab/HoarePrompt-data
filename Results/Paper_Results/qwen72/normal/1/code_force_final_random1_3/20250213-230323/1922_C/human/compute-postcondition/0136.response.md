Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a new list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d1[2]` is 1, `d1[i + 2]` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, and `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the last user input. Additionally, the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.**
