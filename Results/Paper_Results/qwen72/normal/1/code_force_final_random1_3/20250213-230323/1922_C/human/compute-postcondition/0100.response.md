To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d1[2]` is set to 1.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` will be initialized to 0 by the loop.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the latest user input, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Analysis:
- `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
- `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.

Given this information, let's consider the values of `x` and `y`:
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Calculation:
- If `y` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1 because `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1.
- If `y` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 0 because the default value of `d2` is 0.
- Similarly, if `x` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 1.
- If `x` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 0.

### Possible Outcomes:
1. If both `x` and `y` are equal to `n - 1`:
   - `d2[y] = 1` and `d2[x] = 1`
   - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 1 - 1 = 0`

2. If `y` is equal to `n - 1` and `x` is not equal to `n - 1`:
   - `d2[y] = 1` and `d2[x] = 0`
   - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 1 - 0 = 1`

3. If `y` is not equal to `n - 1` and `x` is equal to `n - 1`:
   - `d2[y] = 0` and `d2[x] = 1`
   - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 0 - 1 = -1`

4. If both `x` and `y` are not equal to `n - 1`:
   - `d2[y] = 0` and `d2[x] = 0`
   - `d2[y] - d2[x] = 0 - 0 = 0`

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` will depend on the values of `x` and `y` relative to `n - 1`. However, since `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the only possible outcomes are 0, 1, or -1.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] is 1 if y == n - 1, otherwise 0, and d2[x] is 1 if x == n - 1, otherwise 0)**
