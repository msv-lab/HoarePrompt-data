The given code snippet updates the value of `d2[i]` by setting it to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` remains `n - 4`.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 5.
- `l` remains a list of integers from user input.
- `d1` remains a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0.
- `d2` remains a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is 1.
- The condition about the differences between elements in `l` does not change, but the value of `d2[i]` is updated.

Given that `i` is `n - 4`, the code `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` updates `d2[n - 4]` to `1 + d2[n - 3]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 4`, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, `d2[n - 1]` is 1, and `d2[n - 4]` is `1 + d2[n - 3]`.**
