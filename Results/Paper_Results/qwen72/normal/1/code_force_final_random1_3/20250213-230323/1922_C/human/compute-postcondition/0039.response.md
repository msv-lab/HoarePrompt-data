The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `j` will start at 0.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0 and `j` is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 where `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `j` is 0**
