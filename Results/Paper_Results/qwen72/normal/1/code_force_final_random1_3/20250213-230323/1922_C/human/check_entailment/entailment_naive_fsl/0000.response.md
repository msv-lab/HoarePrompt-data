Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum cost to travel between cities. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the cost to travel from city `x` to city `y` can be calculated by simply subtracting the precomputed costs stored in `d1` and `d2`. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of traveling through the closest city, which should cost only 1 coin.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce incorrect results because it does not correctly handle the cost of traveling through the closest city. For example, in the first query (1, 4), the program should output 3, but it may output a different value due to the incorrect logic in the cost calculation.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the cost using `d1` and `d2`. The correct approach should involve checking the cost of traveling directly versus traveling through the closest city, and choosing the minimum cost. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
