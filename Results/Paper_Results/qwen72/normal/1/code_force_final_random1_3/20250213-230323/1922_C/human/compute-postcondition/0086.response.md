Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is 1 + `d2[i + 1]`, `m` is an input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the last user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` updates the value of `d2[i]`.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `d2[i + 1]` is accessed, which is `d2[n - 2]`.
- Since `d2` is initialized with a default value of 0, `d2[n - 2]` is 0 unless explicitly set otherwise.
- Therefore, `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[n - 2]`, which is `1 + 0 = 1`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
