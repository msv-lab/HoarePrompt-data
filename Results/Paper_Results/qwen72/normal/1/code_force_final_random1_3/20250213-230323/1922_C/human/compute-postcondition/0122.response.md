Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (greater than 2), `l` is a new list of integers from the latest user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 (and no longer contains the entry `d2[n - 1]`), `m` is the new input integer, `j` is `m - 1`, `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the last user input, and the difference between the second and first elements of `l` is greater than or equal to the difference between the first and zeroth elements of `l`.**
