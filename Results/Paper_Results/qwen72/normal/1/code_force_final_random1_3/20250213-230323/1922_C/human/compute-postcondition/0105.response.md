To determine what will be printed by the `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d1[2]` is set to 1.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is set to 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the latest user input.

2. **Relevant Code:**
   ```python
   print(d2[y] - d2[x])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
   - `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - For any other key in `d2` that is not `n - 1`, the value will be 0 (due to the default value of the defaultdict).

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - If `y` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 1.
   - If `y` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y]` will be 0.
   - If `x` is equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x` is not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[x]` will be 0.

5. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - If `y == n - 1` and `x != n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If `y != n - 1` and `x == n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If both `y` and `x` are not equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.
   - If both `y` and `x` are equal to `n - 1`, then `d2[y] - d2[x]` will be `1 - 1 = 0`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The output will depend on the values of `x` and `y` relative to `n - 1`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x] (where d2[y] is 1 if y == n - 1, otherwise 0, and d2[x] is 1 if x == n - 1, otherwise 0)**
