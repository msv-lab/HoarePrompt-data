To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Range Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n - 1)` is non-empty. This means that the starting value (1) must be less than the ending value (`n - 1`).
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute, `1 < n - 1` must be true. Simplifying this, we get `n > 2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will start at 1.
- **`n`**: The input integer `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is set to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is 1, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0**
