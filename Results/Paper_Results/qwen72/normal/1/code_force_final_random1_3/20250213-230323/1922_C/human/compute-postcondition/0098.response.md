Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `l` is a list of integers from the latest user input.
- `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with a default value of 0, and `d2[n - 1]` is explicitly set to 1.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` will be initialized to 0 by the loop.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided by the latest user input, and `y` is greater than `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Defaultdict `d1`**:
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
   - `d1[2]` is explicitly set to 1.
   - For any other key that is not 2, `d1[key]` will return 0.

2. **Values of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the latest user input.
   - `y` is greater than `x`.

3. **Expression `d1[y] - d1[x]`**:
   - If `y` is 2, then `d1[y]` will be 1.
   - If `y` is not 2, then `d1[y]` will be 0.
   - If `x` is 2, then `d1[x]` will be 1.
   - If `x` is not 2, then `d1[x]` will be 0.

4. **Possible Outcomes**:
   - If `y` is 2 and `x` is not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `1 - 0 = 1`.
   - If `y` is not 2 and `x` is 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.
   - If both `y` and `x` are 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `1 - 1 = 0`.
   - If both `y` and `x` are not 2, then `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be `0 - 0 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions and the possible values of `x` and `y`, the output of the `print` statement will depend on whether `x` and `y` are 2 or not. However, since `y` is greater than `x`, the only relevant case is when `y` is 2 and `x` is not 2, which results in `1 - 0 = 1`.

Output: **1 (if y is 2 and x is not 2, otherwise 0)**
