Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with default value 0.** 

The code initializes `d2` as a defaultdict with a default value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
