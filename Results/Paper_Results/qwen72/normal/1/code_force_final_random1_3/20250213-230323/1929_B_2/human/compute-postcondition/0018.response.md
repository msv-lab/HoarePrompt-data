Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` has iterated through the range from 0 to `t-1`, `n` and `k` are integers read from input for each iteration. For each iteration, if \(4 \times n - 2\) equals `k`, the output is `k // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, the output is `ceil(k / 2)`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer within the specified range, and the loop has completed `t` iterations. During each iteration, the loop reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. Depending on whether \(4 \times n - 2\) equals `k`, the loop prints either `k // 2 + 1` or `ceil(k / 2)`. The loop completes all `t` iterations, and the final state reflects the results of these iterations.
