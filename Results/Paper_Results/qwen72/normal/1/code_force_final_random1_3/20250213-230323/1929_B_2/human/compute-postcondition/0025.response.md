To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 * n)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers derived from the input file `s`.

### Conditions for `k`:
- If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), the value of `k` remains as it is.
- If \( k = 4n - 3 \), the value of `k` remains 4 * n - 3.
- If \( k = 4n - 2 \), the value of `k` remains 4 * n - 2.
- If \( k > 4n - 4 \) and \( k \neq 4n - 3 \) and \( k \neq 4n - 2 \), the value of `k` remains unchanged, which could be any value greater than 4 * n - 4.

### Analysis:
- The conditions provided for `k` do not affect the value of `n`.
- The `print(2 * n)` statement simply prints the value of `2 * n`.

### Conclusion:
- Since the value of `n` is not modified by the conditions on `k`, the output of the `print(2 * n)` statement will be twice the value of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 * n (where n is the value of n derived from the input file s)**
