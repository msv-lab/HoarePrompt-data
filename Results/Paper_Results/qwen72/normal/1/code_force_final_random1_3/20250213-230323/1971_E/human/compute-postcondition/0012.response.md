The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i-1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 3, the new element added to `ad` will be `a[3] - a[2]`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `ad` initially contains `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1]]`.
- After appending `a[3] - a[2]`, `ad` will be `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `ad` is a list containing `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`, `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is 3.**
