Output State: **`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l` (now `l + 1`), `m` (now 0), `i` (now 1), `s` (index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order), `ql` (decremented by `a[s - 1]`). `q` must be greater than `l + 1`.** 

Explanation: The variable `m` is set to 0. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions. The value of `l` is `l + 1`, `m` is now 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order, and `ql` is decremented by `a[s - 1]`. The condition that `q` must be greater than `l + 1` remains valid.
