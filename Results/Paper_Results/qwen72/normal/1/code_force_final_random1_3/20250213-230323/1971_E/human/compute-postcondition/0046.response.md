Output State: **All variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `ql`) retain their original values except for `l`, which is incremented by 1, `m` is now 0, `i` is now 1, and `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.**
