To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `s`, `ql` are all defined.
- `l` is incremented by 1.
- `m` is now `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `i` is now 1.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order.
- `ql` is decremented by `a[s - 1]`.
- If `a[s] == ql`, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
- `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.

### Analysis:
1. **Increment `l` by 1**: This means `l` is now one more than its previous value.
2. **Calculate `m`**: 
   - `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`
   - Here, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order.
   - `ql` is decremented by `a[s - 1]` before this calculation.
3. **Check if `a[s] == ql`**: If true, the `continue` statement is executed, and the rest of the loop body is skipped.
4. **Print `int(m)`**: The integer part of `m` is printed.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `s`**: 
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order. This requires knowing the values of `a` and `ql`.
2. **Decrement `ql`**:
   - `ql = ql - a[s - 1]`
3. **Calculate `m`**:
   - `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`
4. **Convert `m` to integer**:
   - `int(m)`

### Example Values:
Let's assume some example values to illustrate the calculation:
- `a = [1, 3, 5, 7]`
- `b = [10, 20, 30, 40]`
- `ad = [2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `bd = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `ql = 6`
- `s` is the index where `6` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order, which is `3` (since `a[2] = 5` and `a[3] = 7`).

1. **Decrement `ql`**:
   - `ql = 6 - a[2] = 6 - 5 = 1`
2. **Calculate `m`**:
   - `m = b[2] + bd[3] * ql / ad[3] = 30 + 4 * 1 / 5 = 30 + 0.8 = 30.8`
3. **Convert `m` to integer**:
   - `int(m) = int(30.8) = 30`

### Final Output:
Based on the given initial state and the example values, the `print` statement will output the integer part of `m`.

Output: **30** (where `m` is the calculated value based on the given formula and conditions)
