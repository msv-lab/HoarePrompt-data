### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b`, which contain the distances and the corresponding times, respectively.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program preprocesses the lists `a` and `b` to create `ad` and `bd`, which store the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It also computes the speeds `v` for each segment using the formula `v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i]`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `ql`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in which the query point lies.
   - If the query point exactly matches a known point, it directly prints the corresponding time from `b`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach the query point by adding the time taken to reach the start of the segment and the additional time taken to travel the remaining distance within the segment.
   - The result is rounded down to the nearest integer using the `int` function.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the query point exactly matches a known point.
   - It also handles the case where the query point falls between two known points and calculates the time accurately.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the segment in which the query point lies, making the solution scalable for large inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the problem described, handles all specified constraints and edge cases, and efficiently processes the queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
