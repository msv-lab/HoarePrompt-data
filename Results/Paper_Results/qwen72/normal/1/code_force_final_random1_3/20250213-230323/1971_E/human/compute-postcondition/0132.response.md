To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `t` remains the same.
- `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input, with the constraint that `q` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements.
- `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`: `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`.
- `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`: `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd`: `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (input integer - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is the input integer minus `a[s - 1]` minus `a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the updated `ql`.
- If `a[s]` is equal to the updated `ql`, the next iteration will be skipped, and `l` is incremented by 1, ensuring that `q` is greater than the new value of `l`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `ad` and `bd`**:
   - `ad` is the list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
   - `bd` is the list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`.

2. **Determine `v`**:
   - `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd`.

3. **Calculate `ql`**:
   - `ql` is the input integer minus `a[s - 1]` minus `a[s - 1]`.

4. **Find `s`**:
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the updated `ql`.

5. **Calculate `m`**:
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (input integer - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.

6. **Print `int(m)`**:
   - The `print` statement will print the integer part of `m`.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity and the dependencies on the input values, the exact numerical value of `m` cannot be determined without specific input values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the integer part of `m`.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (input integer - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])**
