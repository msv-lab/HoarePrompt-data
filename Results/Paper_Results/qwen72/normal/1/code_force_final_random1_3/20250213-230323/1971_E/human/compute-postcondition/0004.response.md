Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` creates a new list `b` that starts with 0 and is followed by the integers read from the input.
- The initial state variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The new list `b` is created and its structure is similar to `a`, starting with 0 and followed by the integers read from the input.
