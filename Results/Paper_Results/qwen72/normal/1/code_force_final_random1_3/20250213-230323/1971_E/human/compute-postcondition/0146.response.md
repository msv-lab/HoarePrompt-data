Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input where `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by at least two integers input by the user, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `ad` is now `[0, a[1], a[2] - a[1], a[3] - a[2]]`, `bd` is now `[0]`, `i` is 3, `v` is not yet updated, `m` is not yet computed, `ql` is not yet updated, `s` is not yet determined, and `l` is not yet updated.**

Explanation: The code `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between the current element `a[3]` and the previous element `a[2]` to the list `ad`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
