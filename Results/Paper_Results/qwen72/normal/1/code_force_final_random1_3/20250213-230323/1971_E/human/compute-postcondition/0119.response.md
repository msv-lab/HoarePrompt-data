Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input where `q` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `ad` is now `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `i` is 1, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is now `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`, `ql` is now the input integer minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`. If `a[s]` is equal to the original `ql`, the next iteration will be skipped. `l` is incremented by 1, and `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` to its current value.
- All other variables remain unchanged or retain their conditions as specified in the initial state.
