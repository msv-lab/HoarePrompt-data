To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input, with `q` being greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements.
   - `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the input and must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements.
   - `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`: `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`.
   - `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`: `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd`: `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `ql` is the input integer.
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`.

2. **Logic:**
   - If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, we continue to the next iteration.
   - `l` is incremented by 1.
   - `q` must be greater than the new value of `l`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(b[s], end=' ')` will print the element at index `s` of the list `b`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the value of `s` is determined by finding the first index in `a` where the element is greater than or equal to `ql`. Once `s` is found, the element at index `s` in the list `b` is printed.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **b[s] (where s is the index of the first element in a that is greater than or equal to ql)**
