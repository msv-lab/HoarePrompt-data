To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1.
- `t` remains the same (not used in the given code).
- `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input, where `q` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements.
- `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`: `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`.
- `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`: `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements of `ad` and `bd`: `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`.
- `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.
- `l` is 0.
- If `a[s]` is exactly equal to the original `ql`, the current iteration ends and the loop continues to the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers provided by the user.
   - `a` starts with 0 and has additional elements.
   - `b` starts with 0 and has at least one more element.

2. **Calculation of `ad` and `bd`:**
   - `ad` is the list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
   - `bd` is the list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`.

3. **Calculation of `v`:**
   - `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements of `ad` and `bd`.

4. **Finding `s`:**
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.

5. **Updating `m` and `ql`:**
   - `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

6. **Printing `int(m)`:**
   - The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer part of `m`.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity of the initial state and the operations involved, the exact value of `m` depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `ql`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the integer part of `m`.

Output: **int(m) (where m is the value of the expression b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])**
