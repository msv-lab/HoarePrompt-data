To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `t` remains the same (not used in the code snippet).
- `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input, where `q` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers input by the user, and it must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations.
- `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements.
- `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a`: `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`.
- `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b`: `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is a list of ratios of corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd`: `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql + a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is the integer input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.
- `l` is 1.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.
   - For example, if `a = [0, 1, 3, 5]` and `ql = 4`, then `s` would be 3 because `a[3] = 5` is the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Calculate `ql`**:
   - `ql` is the integer input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`.
   - Using the previous example, if the user input `ql` is 4, then `ql = 4 - a[2] = 4 - 3 = 1`.

3. **Calculate `m`**:
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql + a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
   - Using the previous example, if `b = [0, 2, 4, 6]`, then:
     - `b[s - 1] = b[2] = 4`
     - `bd[s] = bd[3] = b[3] - b[2] = 6 - 4 = 2`
     - `ad[s] = ad[3] = a[3] - a[2] = 5 - 3 = 2`
     - `ql + a[s - 1] = 1 + 3 = 4`
     - Therefore, `m = 4 + 2 * (4 / 2) = 4 + 2 * 2 = 8`

4. **Print `int(m)`**:
   - The `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement will print the integer value of `m`.

### Final Output:
Based on the calculations, the value of `m` is 8. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **8**
