Postcondition: **_ is 1, `t` remains the same, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned new values from the input where `q` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is now `[0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]]`, `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `i` is 1, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `m` is 0, `ql` is now the integer input by the user, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, `l` is 1. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**
