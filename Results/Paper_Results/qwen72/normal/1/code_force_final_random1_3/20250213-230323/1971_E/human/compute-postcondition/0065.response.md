To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(m), end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

### Initial State:
- `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `l` (now `l + 1`), `m` (now `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`), `i` (now 1), `s` (index where `ql` would be inserted in `a` to maintain sorted order), `ql` (decremented by `a[s - 1]`), `ql` is now an input integer.
- If `a[s] == ql`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.

### Variables and Their Values:
- `m` is updated to `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.
- `ql` is decremented by `a[s - 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `m`:**
   - `m` is initially some value (let's call it `m_initial`).
   - `m` is updated to `m_initial + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`.

2. **Determine the value of `ql`:**
   - `ql` is an input integer.
   - `ql` is decremented by `a[s - 1]`.

3. **Check the condition `a[s] == ql`:**
   - If `a[s] == ql`, the program continues to the next iteration or statement, but this does not affect the current print statement.

4. **Print the value of `int(m)`:**
   - The `print` statement will convert `m` to an integer and print it.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the integer value of `m` after it has been updated. Since the exact values of `m_initial`, `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int(m_initial + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])**
