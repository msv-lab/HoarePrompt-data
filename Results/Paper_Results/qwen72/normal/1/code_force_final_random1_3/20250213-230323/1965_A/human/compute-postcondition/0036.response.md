Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements.
- `1` is in `lis`.
- The length of `lis` is greater than 1.
- `j` is the last index of `lis` (which is `len(lis) - 1`).
- No pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1.
- `test` is True.
- The length of `lis` is odd.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
