### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases, each with the number of piles and the sizes of the piles. This part seems to be correctly implemented using `sys.stdin.readline`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initial Check**: The function checks if the first element of `arr` is not equal to 1. If it is not, it immediately returns 'Alice'. This is incorrect because the game logic should consider all piles, not just the first one.
   - **Set and Sorting**: The function creates a sorted set of unique elements from `arr`. This is a good approach to identify the distinct pile sizes.
   - **Consecutive Differences**: The function iterates through the sorted set to check if any two consecutive elements have a difference greater than 1. If such a pair is found, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it toggles the value of `A` (initially `False`).
   - **Final Toggle**: After the loop, if `not_c` is `True`, it toggles `A` again.
   - **Return Statement**: Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise 'Bob'.

3. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The initial check `if (arr[0] != 1)` is incorrect. The game logic should consider the entire array, not just the first element. For example, if the first pile has 1 stone but other piles have more, Alice can still win by removing 1 stone from all piles.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set is also flawed. The game is more complex and requires a different approach to determine the winner.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The game is a variant of the Nim game. The key to solving this is to use the concept of the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the logical flaws in the initial check and the way it determines the winner. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
