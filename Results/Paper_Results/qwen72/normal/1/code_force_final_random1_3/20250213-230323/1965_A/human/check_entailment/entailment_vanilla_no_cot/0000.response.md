Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The variable `n` is being assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))`, which should only be a single integer representing the number of piles. Instead, it should be `n = int(input())`.

2. **Function Call Issue**: The function `func_1` is called with `arr`, but the function itself is defined to take `arr` as an argument. This part is correct, but the logic inside `func_1` needs to be reviewed.

3. **Logic Flaw in `func_1`**:
   - The condition `if arr[0] != 1:` is not sufficient to determine the winner. The game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes, not just the first element.
   - The logic for checking the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set of pile sizes is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that if the difference is greater than 1, the game state changes. However, the correct approach is to count the number of distinct pile sizes and determine the winner based on the parity of this count.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The game can be reduced to a Nim-like game where the key is the number of distinct pile sizes. If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    result = func_1(arr)
    print(result)

def func_1(arr):
    # Count the number of distinct pile sizes
    distinct_piles = len(set(arr))
    # Determine the winner based on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes
    return 'Alice' if distinct_piles % 2 == 1 else 'Bob'
```

This corrected version correctly handles the input and uses the correct logic to determine the winner based on the number of distinct pile sizes.
