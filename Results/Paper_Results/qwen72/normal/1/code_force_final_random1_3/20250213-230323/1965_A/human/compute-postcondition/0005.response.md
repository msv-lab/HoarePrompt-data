The code snippet sorts the list `set_` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the values of `arr` or `A`. The list `set_` now contains the same unique elements from `arr` (including the number 1), but they are sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `A` is `False`; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, including the number 1.**
