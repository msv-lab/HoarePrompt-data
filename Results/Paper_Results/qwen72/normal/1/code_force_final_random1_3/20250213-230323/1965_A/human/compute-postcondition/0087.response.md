To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the length of the list `lis`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(1, len(lis))` generates at least one value.
   - This means `len(lis)` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjust States Based on the Loop Head:**
   - We need to ensure that `len(lis)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `j` should start at 1, as specified by the `range(1, len(lis))`.

4. **Review Given State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l`.
   - If `1` is not in `lis` or `lis` has only one element, no further changes are made.
   - Otherwise, `lis` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `j` is the last index of `lis` (i.e., `len(lis) - 1`).
   - `test` is True.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Ensure `len(lis)` is greater than 1.
   - Set `j` to 1 for the first iteration of the loop.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `j` is 1.
- `test` is True.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 1, `test` is True**
