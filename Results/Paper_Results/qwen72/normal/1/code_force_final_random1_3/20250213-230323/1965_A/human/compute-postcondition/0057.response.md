Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object containing integers from the new input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique integers from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 1. If the difference between the second element and the first element of `lis` is greater than 1, then `test` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `test` remains True.***
