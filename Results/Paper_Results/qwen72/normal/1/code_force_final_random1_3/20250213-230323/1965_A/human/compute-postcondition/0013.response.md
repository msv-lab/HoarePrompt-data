To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.
- `A` is `True`.
- `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, including the number 1, and `len(set_)` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If the difference between the second element and the first element of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains `True`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of `set_` starting from 1 (the second element) up to `len(set_) - 1` (the last element).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(set_)`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `len(set_)`.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `A` is `True`; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, including the number 1, and `len(set_)` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2; if the difference between the third element and the second element of `set_` is greater than 1, then `not_c` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains `True`.**
