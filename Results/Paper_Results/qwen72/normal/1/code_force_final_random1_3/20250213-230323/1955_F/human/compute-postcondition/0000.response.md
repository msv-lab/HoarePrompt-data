To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions and variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

Here, the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter.
   - The loop condition depends on the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, it implies that `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, representing the counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the input should be a positive integer.

### Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute if the input is a positive integer.
- The initial state of `t` and `p_i` does not directly affect the loop's execution, but they are part of the overall context.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `p_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200, representing the counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
