### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR is non-zero.
   - The sequence consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, and we are given the counts of these numbers.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position that is set to 1 is even.
   - For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:
     - 1 (binary: 001)
     - 2 (binary: 010)
     - 3 (binary: 011)
     - 4 (binary: 100)
   - The XOR of these numbers can be simplified by considering their parity (even or odd counts).

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func` processes each test case.
   - It reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It uses a lambda function to adjust the counts to be even by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2.
   - It then checks if the sum of the parities of the first three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) is 3, which indicates a special condition.
   - Finally, it prints the result, which is the sum of the adjusted counts divided by 2 plus the special condition check.

4. **Special Condition**:
   - The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if all three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) are odd.
   - If this condition is true, it adds 1 to the result, indicating an additional win for Bob.

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - The main result is calculated as `sum(p) // 2`, which effectively counts the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - Adding the special condition ensures that if all three counts are odd, Bob gets an extra win.

6. **Verification**:
   - The logic aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code:

- **Input Handling**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

- **Adjusting Counts to Even**:
  - The lambda function `lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2` adjusts each count to the nearest even number.
  - This is done to ensure that the XOR of the remaining numbers can be zero by removing pairs of numbers.

- **Special Condition Check**:
  - The condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if all three counts (1s, 2s, 3s) are odd.
  - If true, it adds 1 to the result, indicating an additional win for Bob.

- **Result Calculation**:
  - The main result is calculated as `sum(p) // 2`, which counts the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
  - Adding the special condition ensures that if all three counts are odd, Bob gets an extra win.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. The program aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

Final: **True**
