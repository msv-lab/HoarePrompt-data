Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p` is a list of the nearest even numbers derived from the input integers, the loop has run `t` times, and there are 0 iterations left.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, as it was initially defined.
- **`p`**: For each iteration of the loop, `p` is updated to be a list of the nearest even numbers derived from the input integers. After all iterations, `p` will reflect the final set of even numbers from the last input.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `t` times, as specified by the initial value of `t`. After all iterations, the loop has completed its execution, and there are no more iterations left to run.
