The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally process a set of test cases or inputs, where each test case involves an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and four integers `p_i` (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200). The function's output is not specified in the prompt, but typically, such a function would return some result based on the processing of these inputs.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function signature and the absence of a clear output description, I will assume that the function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and four integers `p_i` (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200), and returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
