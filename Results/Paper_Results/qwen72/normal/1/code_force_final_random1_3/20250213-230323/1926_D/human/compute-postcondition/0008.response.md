Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31) and must have at least 1 element, `res` is 0, `count` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value decreased by 1, `num` is the first element of `a`, and `num` is in `count`. The current value of `count[num]` is 0.**
