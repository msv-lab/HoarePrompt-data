Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to 200000, computing the sum of the digits of each number using the function `func_1`.
   - For each number `i`, it adds the result of `func_1(i)` to `sum` and appends `sum` to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` and computes the sum of its digits.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly extract the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`) and add it to `a`.
   - It then updates `num` by removing the last digit (using `int(num / 10)`).
   - The function correctly returns the sum of the digits of `num`.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the precomputed sum from the list `A` at index `n-1`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200000.
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time by directly accessing the precomputed list `A`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly computes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200000 and stores the cumulative sums in `A`.
   - For each test case, it correctly retrieves the precomputed sum for the given `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
