Output State: **The state of `i` remains 3, `j` is '3', and `pd[3]` is increased by 3.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value at index `i` (which is 3) in the dictionary or list `pd` by the integer value of `j` (which is '3'). Since `int('3')` is 3, `pd[3]` is increased by 3. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
