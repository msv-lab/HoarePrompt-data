Output State: **`num` is 0, `a` is the sum of the digits of the original `num`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `num` becomes 0 because the loop continues to divide `num` by 10 until it reaches 0. The variable `a` accumulates the sum of the digits of the original `num` as the loop progresses, adding the last digit of `num` to `a` in each iteration. Therefore, when the loop finishes, `a` holds the sum of all the digits of the original `num`.
