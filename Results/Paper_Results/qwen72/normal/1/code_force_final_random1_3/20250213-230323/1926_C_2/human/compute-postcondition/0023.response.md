To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `j` and the expression `str(i)`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `str(i)` is a non-empty string. Since `i` is an integer, `str(i)` will always be a non-empty string as long as `i` is not zero.

3. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is `'2'`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The loop will execute because `str(3)` is "3", which is a non-empty string.
   - The variable `j` will take on the values of the characters in the string "3" during each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `j` will be '3' in the first (and only) iteration.

5. **Final State:**
   - The state of `i` remains 3.
   - The state of `j` will be '3' when the loop starts.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`i` is 3, `j` is '3', `N` must be greater than 3, `pd[2]` is `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`, `pd[3]` is `pd[3] + pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`**
