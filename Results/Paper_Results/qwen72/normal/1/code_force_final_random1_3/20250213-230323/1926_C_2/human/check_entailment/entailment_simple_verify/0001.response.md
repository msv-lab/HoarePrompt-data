### Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Sums:**
   - The program correctly precomputes the sums of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to 200,000. For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits using the function `func_1` and adds this value to the running total `sum`. The result is then appended to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It does this by repeatedly taking the last digit of `num` (using `num % 10`) and adding it to the variable `a`, then removing the last digit (using `int(num / 10)`).
   - This process continues until `num` becomes 0.
   - The state annotation confirms that `a` is the sum of the digits of the original `num` when `num` becomes 0.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the precomputed sum of digit sums for the numbers from 1 to `n` by accessing `A[n - 1]`.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where n is 200,000. This is efficient enough given the constraints.
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time by simply looking up the precomputed value in the list `A`.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The logic for calculating the sum of digits and the precomputation of the sums are both correct.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct results for each.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
