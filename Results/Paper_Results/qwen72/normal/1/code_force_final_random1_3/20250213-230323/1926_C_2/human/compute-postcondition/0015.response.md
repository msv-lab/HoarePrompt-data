Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `'2'`, `N` must be greater than 2, `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`**

Explanation: The code `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value of `pd[2]` by the integer value of `j`, which is `2`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is `'2'`, the value of `pd[2]` is updated to `pd[2] + 2`. The initial condition `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1]` remains valid, so the final value of `pd[2]` is `pd[2] + pd[1] + 2`. The values of `i`, `j`, and the condition that `N` must be greater than 2 remain unchanged.
