The function `func` does not explicitly list any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function likely processes a series of test cases, where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is an integer representing some value to be processed. The function's output is not specified in the prompt, but typically, such a function would return or print results corresponding to each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.

The function is expected to handle these inputs and produce an output for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), where for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is provided. The function returns or prints a result for each test case based on the value of `n`.**
