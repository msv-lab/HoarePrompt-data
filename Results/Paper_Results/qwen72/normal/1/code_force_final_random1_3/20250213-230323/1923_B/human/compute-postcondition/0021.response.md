Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`; `rest` is now `rest - delta`. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`, `pos`) retain their previous values, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`.
- The value of `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`.
- All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`, `pos`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices` still holds true.
