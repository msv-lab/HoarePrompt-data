Postcondition: ***`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `rest` is `rest - delta`; `pos` is an index less than the length of `sorted_indices` indicating the next monster to target; `distance` is `distance + 1`; `a` is a list where the health of each monster has been reduced according to the number of bullets fired, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `rest` is `rest - delta`, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is now 0. In both cases, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values. If `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance` or `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos-1]]) == distance`, the program returns `False`.***
