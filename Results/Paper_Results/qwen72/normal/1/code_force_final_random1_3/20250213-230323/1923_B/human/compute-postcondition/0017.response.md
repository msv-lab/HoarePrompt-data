The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: A positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: A positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of monsters.
- `k`: A positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9) representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second.
- `a`: A list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the health of each monster.
- `x`: A list of `n` distinct integers (-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0) representing the initial positions of the monsters relative to your character.

The function returns the minimum time required to defeat all the monsters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. It returns the minimum time required to defeat all the monsters for each test case.**
