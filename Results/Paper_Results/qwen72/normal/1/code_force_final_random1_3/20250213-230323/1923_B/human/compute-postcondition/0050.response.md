Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`, and `pos` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` may be updated depending on the condition. `distance` remains unchanged, and `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values. `rest` must be greater than 0, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.**

Explanation:
- `delta` is assigned the value of the minimum between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
- `rest` is then updated to `rest - delta`.
- Depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0:
  - If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is updated to `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]] - delta`.
  - Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is updated to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`.
- `distance` remains unchanged.
- `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values.
- The conditions that `rest` must be greater than 0 and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices` remain valid.
