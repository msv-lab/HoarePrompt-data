The value of `rest` is decreased by `delta`. Since `rest` was initially `k` and `delta` is the minimum of `k` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, the new value of `rest` will be `k - delta`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`rest` is `k - delta`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, `delta` is the minimum of `k` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, all other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.**
