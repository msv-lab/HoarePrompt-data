Output State: **`rest` is `k - 3*delta`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is `-delta`, `distance` is `distance + 1`, `delta` is the minimum of `k - delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-2]]` is 0. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `-delta`. Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` remains `-delta`. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pos` is incremented by 1.
- The rest of the variables (`rest`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `distance`, `delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-2]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`) remain as described in the initial state, with the specific conditions applied to `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` based on whether it was 0 or not.
- All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.
