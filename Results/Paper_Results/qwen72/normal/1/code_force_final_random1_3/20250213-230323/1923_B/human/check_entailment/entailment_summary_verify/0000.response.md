### Reasoning:

1. **Sorting by Distance**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distances from the player. This ensures that the closest monsters are handled first, which is crucial because the player needs to prioritize killing the closest monsters to avoid being killed.

2. **Bullet Management**:
   - The function uses a loop to manage the firing of bullets. It iterates through the sorted indices and fires up to `k` bullets per second, reducing the health of the targeted monsters accordingly. If a monster's health drops to zero, it is removed from consideration. This is implemented correctly using the `rest` variable to keep track of the remaining bullets for the current second.

3. **Distance Check**:
   - After each round of firing, the function checks if any monster has reached the player's position (i.e., if the distance is zero). If so, the function returns `False`, indicating that the player cannot survive. This check is crucial and is implemented correctly.

4. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. It reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the appropriate result (`YES` or `NO`). The function correctly processes the input and output as required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when the number of bullets per second is limited and when the player cannot survive if the number of bullets is insufficient to kill the closest monsters before they reach the player.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
