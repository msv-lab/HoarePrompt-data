Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second, `n` is the length of the list `a` (and also the length of the list `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to `n-1` sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while pos != len(sorted_indices):
    if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
        return False
    rest = k
    while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
        delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
        rest -= delta
        a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
        if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
            pos += 1
    distance += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, the health of each monster in the list `a` will be reduced according to the number of bullets fired, and the variable `rest` will be 0 or the remaining bullets that could not be used because there were no more monsters with non-zero health to target. The variable `pos` will be the index of the next monster in the `sorted_indices` list that has not been fully defeated, or it will be equal to the length of `sorted_indices` if all monsters have been defeated. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`) will retain their initial values, except `distance` which is now `distance + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After all iterations of the loop, the health of each monster in the list `a` will be reduced according to the number of bullets fired, and the variable `rest` will be set to `0` (indicating no more bullets left) or `pos` will be equal to the length of `sorted_indices` (indicating all monsters have been defeated). The variable `pos` will be an index less than the length of `sorted_indices` indicating the next monster to target, or it will be equal to the length of `sorted_indices` if all monsters have been defeated. The variable `distance` will be `distance + 1` after the loop completes. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) will retain their initial values. If `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance + 1`, the program returns `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `rest` is 0 or `pos` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`. The variable `a` has been modified such that each element at the positions specified by `sorted_indices` has been reduced by the corresponding `delta` values until either `rest` becomes 0 or `pos` reaches the end of `sorted_indices`. The `distance` variable has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
