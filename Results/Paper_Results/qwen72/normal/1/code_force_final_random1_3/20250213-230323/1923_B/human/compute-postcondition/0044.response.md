Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `rest` remains unchanged; `pos` remains unchanged; `distance` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values.**

Explanation:
- `delta` is assigned the value of the minimum between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
- `rest`, `pos`, `distance`, and the list `a` remain unchanged because no operations are performed on them in this code snippet.
- The variables `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` are not modified and retain their initial values.
