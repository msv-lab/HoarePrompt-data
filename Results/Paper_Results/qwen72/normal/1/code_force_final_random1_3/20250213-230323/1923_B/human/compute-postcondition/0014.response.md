The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input
- `_` is 2

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `_` is 2.**
