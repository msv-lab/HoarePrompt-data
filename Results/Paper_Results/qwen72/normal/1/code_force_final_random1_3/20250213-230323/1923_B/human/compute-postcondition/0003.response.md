Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of n distinct integers where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, `_` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged, except that `a` now holds the new list of integers read from the input. The conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `_` specified in the initial state still hold true.
