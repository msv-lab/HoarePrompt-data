Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Sorting by Distance**: The `func_1` function sorts the indices of the monsters based on their absolute distances from the player. This ensures that the closest monsters are handled first, which is crucial because the player needs to eliminate the closest threats before they reach the player.

2. **Handling Monsters**: The function iterates through the sorted indices, attempting to reduce the health of each monster by firing up to `k` bullets per second. It checks if the current monster's distance matches the current time step (`distance`). If a monster is at the same distance as the current time step, it means the monster has reached the player, and the function returns `False`.

3. **Bullet Management**: The function manages the number of bullets fired in each second, ensuring that no more than `k` bullets are used. It also updates the health of the monsters accordingly and increments the `pos` index when a monster is killed.

4. **Distance Increment**: The `distance` variable is incremented at the end of each second to simulate the movement of the monsters closer to the player.

5. **Test Case Handling**: The `func_2` function reads the number of test cases and processes each one by calling `func_1` with the appropriate inputs. It prints "YES" if the player can survive and "NO" otherwise.

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description, making it a correct solution.
