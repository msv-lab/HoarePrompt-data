The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `t`. The loop's continuation depends on whether `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
