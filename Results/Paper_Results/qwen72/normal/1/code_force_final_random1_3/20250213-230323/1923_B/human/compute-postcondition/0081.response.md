Output State: **`rest` is 0 or `pos` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`. The variable `a` has been modified such that each element at the positions specified by `sorted_indices` has been reduced by the corresponding `delta` values until either `rest` becomes 0 or `pos` reaches the end of `sorted_indices`. The `distance` variable has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.**
