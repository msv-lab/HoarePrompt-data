Output State: **`rest` is `k - delta`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `distance` is `distance + 1`, `delta` is the minimum of `k - delta` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is 0. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.**

Explanation:
- `delta` is updated to the minimum of `rest` (which is `k - delta`) and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` (which is 0).
- Since `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `delta` will be 0 because the minimum of any number and 0 is 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
