Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, and `_` remains 0. The new value of `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
