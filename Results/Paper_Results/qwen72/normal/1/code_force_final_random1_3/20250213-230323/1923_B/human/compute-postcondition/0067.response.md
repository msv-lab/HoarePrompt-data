Postcondition: ***`rest` is `k - delta`, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is increased by 1, `distance` is `distance + 1`, `delta` is the minimum of `k` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is 0. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) retain their initial values.***
