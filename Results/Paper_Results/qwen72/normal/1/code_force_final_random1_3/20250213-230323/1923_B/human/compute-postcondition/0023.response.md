Postcondition: ***`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is reduced by `delta`, `rest` is now `rest - delta`, and `pos` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`, and `rest` is now `rest - delta`. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`) retain their previous values, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.***
