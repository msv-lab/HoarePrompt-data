Output State: **`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `rest` is now `rest - delta`; `pos` remains unchanged; `distance` remains unchanged; `a` is updated such that `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`; `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values.**
