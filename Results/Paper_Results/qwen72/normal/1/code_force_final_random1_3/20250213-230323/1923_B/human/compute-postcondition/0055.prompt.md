Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, the health of each monster in the list `a` will be reduced according to the number of bullets fired, and the variable `rest` will be set to `k`. The variable `pos` will be an index less than the length of `sorted_indices` indicating the next monster to target, or it will be equal to the length of `sorted_indices` if all monsters have been defeated. All other variables (`x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`, `distance`) will retain their initial values, except `distance` which is now `distance + 1`. If `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`, the program returns False.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`; `rest` is `rest - delta`; `pos` is an index less than the length of `sorted_indices` indicating the next monster to target; `distance` is `distance + 1`; `a` is a list where the health of each monster has been reduced according to the number of bullets fired, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `rest` is `rest - delta`, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is now 0. In both cases, `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values. If `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance` or `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos-1]]) == distance`, the program returns `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0. `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is updated to `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]] - delta`. Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is updated to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`. `distance` remains unchanged, and `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` or `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` depending on the condition. `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is 0, `delta` is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]`, `rest` is `rest - delta`, `pos` is incremented by 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` is updated to `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]] - delta`. Otherwise, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is updated to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`. `distance` remains unchanged, and `x`, `k`, `n`, and `sorted_indices` retain their initial values.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
