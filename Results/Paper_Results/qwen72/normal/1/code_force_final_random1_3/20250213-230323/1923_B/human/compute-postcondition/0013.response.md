The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts using spaces as delimiters, converts each part into an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input
- `_` is 2

After executing the code, the list `a` is updated with the new list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is 2.**
