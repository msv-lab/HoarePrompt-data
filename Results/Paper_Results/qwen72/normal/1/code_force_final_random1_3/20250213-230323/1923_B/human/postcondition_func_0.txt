The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `a` (a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster), `x` (a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters), and `k` (a positive integer representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second). It returns `True` if it is possible to defeat all the monsters by firing up to `k` bullets per second, and `False` otherwise. If the function returns `True`, all monsters' health in the list `a` will be reduced to 0 or lower, and the function will have processed all monsters in the order of their proximity to the origin. If the function returns `False`, it indicates that at least one monster could not be defeated under the given constraints. The lists `a` and `x`, and the integer `k` remain unchanged except for the modifications to the health values in `a`.
