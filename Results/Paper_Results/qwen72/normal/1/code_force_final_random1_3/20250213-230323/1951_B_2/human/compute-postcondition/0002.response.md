Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range [1, 10^9]; `x` is the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is an empty list; `c` is 0.** 

Explanation: The variable `c` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`a`, `x`, and `ind`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
