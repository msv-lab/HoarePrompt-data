Output State: **`s[0]` is now the original value of `s[k - 1]`, `s[k - 1]` is now the original value of `s[0]`, `h` is now the original value of `s[0]`, `z` is 1 if any element in `s` equals the original value of `s[0]`, otherwise it remains 0, `i` is the last element of `s` excluding the first element, `n` and `k` retain their original values, `j` is `len(s) - 2`, `ans` is the number of elements in `s` (excluding the first element) that are less than or equal to `h`, `p` is `len(s) - 2`, `ans1` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans1` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`s[0]`, `s[k - 1]`, `h`, `z`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `j`, `ans`, `p`) retain their values from the initial state.
