To determine what will be printed by the `print(ind)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **List `a`**: It is a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range [1, 10^9].
2. **Variable `x`**: It is the integer at index `k` in the list `a`. Given that `k` is 14, `x` is `a[14]`.
3. **List `ind`**: It contains the indices of up to the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
4. **Variable `c`**: It is 2 if there were at least two elements in `a` greater than `x`, otherwise it is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `x` (which could be 0 or 1). The loop breaks as soon as `c` reaches 2.

Given these conditions, let's analyze what `ind` will contain:

- The loop iterates through the list `a` starting from the beginning and checks each element to see if it is greater than `x`.
- If an element is greater than `x`, its index is added to the list `ind`.
- The loop stops as soon as `ind` contains 2 indices (i.e., `c` reaches 2).

Since `k` is 14, `x` is `a[14]`. The loop will find the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[14]` and store their indices in `ind`.

Therefore, `ind` will contain the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[14]`.

Output: **[index1, index2] (where index1 and index2 are the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[14]`)**
