Output State: **`s` must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `s`, if `i` == `h`, `z` is 1, if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is increased by 1, if `i` > `h`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, if `z` == 1, `ans1` is increased by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
