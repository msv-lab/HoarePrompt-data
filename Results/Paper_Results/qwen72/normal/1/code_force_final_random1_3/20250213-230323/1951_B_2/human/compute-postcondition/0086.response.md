Output State: **`s` must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element of `s` (s[3]), and `j` is increased by 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, while the other conditions remain unchanged. The list `s` still has at least 4 elements, and `i` remains the fourth element of `s`.
