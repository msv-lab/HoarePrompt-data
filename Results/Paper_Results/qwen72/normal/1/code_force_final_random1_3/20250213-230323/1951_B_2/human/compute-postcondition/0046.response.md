The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is at least 2, and all integers are distinct and within the range [1, 10^9]. The function returns different values based on specific conditions:

- **Case_1:** If the function returns the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of integers in the list `a`.
- **Case_2:** If the function returns 13.
- **Case_3:** If the function returns an integer which is one less than the index of the first element in list `a` that is greater than `x`. This index is greater than 14 and not 0.
- **Case_4:** If the function returns the maximum value between `14 - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x` and is less than or equal to 14.
- **Case_5:** If the function returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and 13, given that `ind` is a list containing at least two elements, the first element of `ind` is 0, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second element in `a` that is greater than `x`.
- **Case_6:** If the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, where `ind` is a list of indices of up to the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `ind` has at least two elements.
- **Case_7:** If the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `14 - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the first index in the list `ind` of elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `14` is the index of `x` in the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of at least 2 distinct integers within the range [1, 10^9]. It returns different values based on specific conditions involving the indices of elements in `a` that are greater than a certain value `x` and the length of the list.**
