The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `a` and `b` (where `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`), and calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine a winner. The results of these calls are stored in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in `results` exactly once. The final state of the program is that `results` contains the outcomes of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case, and these outcomes have been printed to the console.
