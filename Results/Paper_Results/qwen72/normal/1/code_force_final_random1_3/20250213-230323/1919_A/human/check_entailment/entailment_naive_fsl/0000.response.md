Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not handle the game logic correctly. The function `func_1` determines the winner based solely on whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. However, this approach is incorrect because the game involves strategic decisions about swapping wallets and removing coins, which can affect the outcome.

For example, consider the case where Alice has 2 coins and Bob has 1 coin (`a = 2`, `b = 1`):

- Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, making `a = 1` and `b = 2`.
- Bob then has to remove a coin from his wallet, making `a = 1` and `b = 1`.
- Alice can now remove a coin from her wallet, making `a = 0` and `b = 1`.
- Bob is forced to remove a coin from his wallet, making `a = 0` and `b = 0`.
- Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

However, according to the function `func_1`, the sum of coins is `2 + 1 = 3`, which is odd, so it would incorrectly predict that Alice wins. This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
