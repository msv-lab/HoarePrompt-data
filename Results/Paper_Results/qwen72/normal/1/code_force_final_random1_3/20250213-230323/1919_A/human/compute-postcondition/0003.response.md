The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^9, the values of `a` and `b` will now be set to these input values. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is an empty list, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and `a` and `b` are set to the input values.**
