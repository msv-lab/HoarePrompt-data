The function `func_2` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints, it seems to accept a parameter `t` which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, it also accepts two parameters `a` and `b` which are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. However, since the function signature does not include these parameters, we assume they are part of the context or passed in another way (e.g., through a list or tuple).

Given the constraints and the lack of explicit return statements in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine the exact return value without additional context. However, based on common practices, we can infer that the function likely processes the inputs `a` and `b` for each of the `t` test cases and returns some result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000), and for each test case, it takes two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**
