Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner` and the new value of `winner` (result of `func_1(a, b)`), `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `a` and `b` are set to the new input values, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value of `winner` to the `results` list.
- The value of `winner` is the result of the function `func_1(a, b)`.
- The variables `t`, `_`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The `results` list now contains the original value of `winner` and the new value of `winner` (which is the result of `func_1(a, b)`).
