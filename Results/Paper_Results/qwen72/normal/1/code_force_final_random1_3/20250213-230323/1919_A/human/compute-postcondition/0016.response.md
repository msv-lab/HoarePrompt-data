Initial State: `results` is a list containing at least one result from `func_1(a, b)`, `result` is the first element in `results`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The `results` list contains at least one result from the function `func_1(a, b)`.
2. The variable `result` is assigned the value of the first element in the `results` list.
3. The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, and the implementation of `func_1(a, b)` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the given information, we know that `result` is the first element of the `results` list, which is a result of the function `func_1(a, b)`.

Output: **result (where result is the first element of the results list, which is a result of func_1(a, b))**
