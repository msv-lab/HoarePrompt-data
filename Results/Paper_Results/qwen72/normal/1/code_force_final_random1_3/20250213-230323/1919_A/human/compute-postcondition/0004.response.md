Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable, `results` is an empty list, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `a` and `b` are set to the input values, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.** 

The variable `winner` is now assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
