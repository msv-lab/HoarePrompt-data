The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string representation of `i`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` when converted to a string. If `i` is an integer greater than 0, converting it to a string will result in a non-empty string, allowing the loop to execute.

Given that `i` is 2, converting `i` to a string will result in `"2"`, which is a non-empty string, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `j` will take the value `'2'` during the first (and only) iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is 2 and `j` is `'2'`.

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `'2'`, `N` must be greater than 2, `pd[2]` is now `pd[2] + pd[1]`**
