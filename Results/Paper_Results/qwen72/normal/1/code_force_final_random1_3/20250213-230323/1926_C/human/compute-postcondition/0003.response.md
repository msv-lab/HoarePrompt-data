The value of `num` is updated to the integer division of its original value by 10, which means it loses its last digit. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `num % 10`, which is the last digit of the original `num`. Since `num` is now the original `num` divided by 10, it is an integer between 0 and 20000 (inclusive), assuming the original `num` was within the specified range.

Output State: **`num` is an integer such that 0 <= num <= 20000, `a` is the last digit of the original `num`.**
