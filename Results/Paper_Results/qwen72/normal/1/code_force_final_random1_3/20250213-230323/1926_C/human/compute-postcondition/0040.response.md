Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is 200000, `pd[200000]` contains the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999, `t` is 0, and `n` has been an input integer for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` remains 200000, and `pd[200000]` still holds the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999. The variable `t` is now 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed. For each iteration of the loop, `n` was set to an input integer provided by the user.
