Output State: **`i` remains 3, `j` is '3', and `pd[3]` is increased by 9.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over the string representation of `i`, which is '3'. Since `i` is 3, the loop will run once for each character in the string '3'. In each iteration, the value of `j` is '3', and `pd[3]` is incremented by the integer value of `j`, which is 3. Since the loop runs 3 times (once for each character in '3'), `pd[3]` is incremented by 3 in each iteration, resulting in a total increment of 9. The value of `i` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
