Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Precomputation**: The program precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores these values in the list `A`. This allows for quick lookups during the actual test cases, which is crucial given the time constraint of 0.5 seconds per test.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number. It iterates through each digit of the number, adding it to the sum `a`, and then divides the number by 10 to move to the next digit.

3. **Sum Accumulation**: The main loop accumulates the sum of digit sums for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores these accumulated sums in the list `A`.

4. **Test Case Handling**: For each test case, the program reads the input `n`, looks up the precomputed sum in the list `A`, and prints it. This ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the time constraints.

Given these points, the program should correctly handle the problem as specified and produce the correct output for the given inputs.
