The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string representation of `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains 3, and `j` was the last character in the string `'3'`.

Since `i` is 3, the string representation of `i` is `'3'`, which contains only one character. Therefore, after the first (and only) iteration where `j` is `'3'`, there are no more characters left in the string `'3'` for the loop to iterate over.

For the loop to execute one more time, the string representation of `i` would need to have more characters. However, since `i` is 3, the string representation of `i` will always be `'3'`, which has only one character.

Thus, the loop cannot execute one more time because there are no more characters in the string `'3'` to iterate over.

State: **`i` remains 3, `j` is '3', and `pd[3]` is increased by 3**
