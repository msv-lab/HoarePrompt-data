To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to consider the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `num != 0`. Given the state right before the loop:

- `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5
- `a` is 0

The variable `num` already satisfies the condition `num != 0` because it is constrained to be between 1 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is 0**
