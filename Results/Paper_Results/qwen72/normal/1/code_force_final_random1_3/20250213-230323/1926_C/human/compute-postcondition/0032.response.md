The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means that `n` will hold the integer value entered by the user. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 200000, `pd[200000]` contains the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `pd` plus the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to 199999, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**
