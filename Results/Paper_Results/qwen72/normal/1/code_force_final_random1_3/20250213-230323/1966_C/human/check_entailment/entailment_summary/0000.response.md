Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by determining the winner of the game based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes. If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins. This is because Alice always starts, and the game essentially reduces to a Nim-like game where the player who faces a position with an even number of distinct pile sizes loses if both play optimally.

The program processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.
2. It sorts the unique pile sizes in descending order and appends a zero to handle edge cases.
3. It uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to track the state of the game. The variable `dp` is initialized to `True`, representing Alice's turn.
4. It iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes and updates the `dp` state based on whether the difference between consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1. This step ensures that the game state changes correctly based on the rules of the game.
5. Finally, it prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` (indicating Alice wins) and "Bob" otherwise.

The logic of the program aligns with the game's rules and the optimal strategy. The use of sorting and checking the differences between consecutive pile sizes effectively captures the essence of the game's dynamics.

Therefore, the program is correct.
