t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
