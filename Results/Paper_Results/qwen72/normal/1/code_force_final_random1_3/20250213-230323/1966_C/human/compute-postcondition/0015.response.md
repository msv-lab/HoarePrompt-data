The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is an input integer where 0 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `True` if any consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) differ by more than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`**
