The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4. This range ensures that `tc` is already greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
