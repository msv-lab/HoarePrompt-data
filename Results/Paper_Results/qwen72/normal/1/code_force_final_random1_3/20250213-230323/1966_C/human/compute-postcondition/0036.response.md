To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1`
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `dp` is `True`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n)` is non-empty. This means `n` must be greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`).

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
- **`i`**: The initial value of `i` is `n - 1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head condition. The loop will set `i` to values from 1 to `n-1`.

### Final State:
- `tc` remains as an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2
- `t` remains as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `arr` remains a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0
- `i` is `n - 1` (but this is not relevant to the loop head condition)
- `dp` remains `True`

### Adjusted State:
State: **`tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is `True`**
