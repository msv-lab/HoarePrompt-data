Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is True.**

The variable `dp` is set to `True`. All other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
