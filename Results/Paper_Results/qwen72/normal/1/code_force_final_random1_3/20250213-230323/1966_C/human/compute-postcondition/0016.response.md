The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user through the `input()` function. The other variables (`tc`, `t`, `arr`, `i`, `dp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `True` if any consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) differ by more than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`.**
