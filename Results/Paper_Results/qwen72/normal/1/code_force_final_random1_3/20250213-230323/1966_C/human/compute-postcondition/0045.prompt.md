Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
    tc -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is an input integer where 0 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n-1`, `dp` is `True` if any consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) differ by more than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `tc` is an input integer where 0 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4 - 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is `True` if any difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (excluding the last element which is 0) is greater than 1, otherwise `dp` is `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `tc` is an input integer where 0 < tc ≤ 10^4 - 3, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp` is the result of the expression `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or ... or arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not True`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
