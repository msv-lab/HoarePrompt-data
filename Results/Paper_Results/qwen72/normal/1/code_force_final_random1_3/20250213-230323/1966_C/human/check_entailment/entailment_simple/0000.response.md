Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the winner of a game played on piles of stones, where players take turns removing the same number of stones from each non-empty pile. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even nature) of the differences between the sizes of the piles. Specifically, if there exists a difference greater than 1 between any two consecutive pile sizes when sorted, the first player (Alice) can always force a win by making the game state unfavorable for the second player (Bob).

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Pile Sizes Processing**: For each test case, it reads the number of piles (`n`) and the sizes of the piles (`arr`). It then sorts the unique pile sizes in descending order and appends a 0 to the end of the list. This step ensures that the differences between consecutive elements represent the gaps between pile sizes.
3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Logic**: The variable `dp` is initialized to `True`. The loop iterates through the sorted pile sizes, checking if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If such a difference is found, `dp` is set to `True`, indicating that Alice can force a win. Otherwise, `dp` remains `False`, indicating that Bob can force a win.
4. **Output**: The program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" if `dp` is `False`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Correctness of the DP Logic**: The logic correctly identifies whether there is a gap greater than 1 between any two consecutive pile sizes. If such a gap exists, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when all piles have the same size or when there is only one pile.
- **Efficiency**: The program efficiently processes the input by sorting the unique pile sizes and iterating through them, ensuring that the solution is within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
