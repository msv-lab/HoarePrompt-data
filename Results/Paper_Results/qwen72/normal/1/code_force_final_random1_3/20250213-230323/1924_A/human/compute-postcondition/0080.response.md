Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - 97`, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the second character of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `ans` remains an empty string, and `cur` remains unchanged.***
