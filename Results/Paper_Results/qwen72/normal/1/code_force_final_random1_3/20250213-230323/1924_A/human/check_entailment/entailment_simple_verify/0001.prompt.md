You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `i` is `t-1` (which would be -1 since `t` is 0), `n`, `k`, and `m` are the final input integers for the last test case, `s` is the final input string for the last test case, `cnt` is the total number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the last test case, `ans` is the final string constructed during the last test case, and `cur` is the final bitmask value after processing all characters in the last test case. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" followed by the string `ans` concatenated with `tmp` (if `tmp` is not an empty string) and `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide one such string that is not a subsequence.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid subsequences found, `cur` to track the current bitmask of characters seen, and `ans` to store the result string.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - Converts the character to its corresponding index in the alphabet.
     - Updates the bitmask `cur` if the character has not been seen before.
     - If all `k` characters have been seen (i.e., `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`), it increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.
     - Appends the character to `ans`.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`:
     - If true, it prints "YES".
     - If false, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence:
       - Finds the first character not seen in `s` and appends it to `ans`.
       - Appends 'a' to `ans` until it reaches length `n`.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the construction of the string that is not a subsequence.
   - The variable `ans` is used both to store the result string and to count the number of valid subsequences, which can lead to confusion.
   - The logic for constructing the string that is not a subsequence is flawed. It should generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence, but the current logic does not ensure this.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
     - Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - Check if each generated string is a subsequence of `s`.
     - If any generated string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string.
     - If all generated strings are subsequences, print "YES".

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It has logical issues in constructing the string that is not a subsequence and in handling the result.
