Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the first two characters of `s`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`.***
