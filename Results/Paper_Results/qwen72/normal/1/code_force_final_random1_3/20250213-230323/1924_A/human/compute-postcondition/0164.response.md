The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `tmp` by converting the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i` into its corresponding character.

Given that `i` is 2, the calculation `ord('a') + i` results in the ASCII value of `'a'` (which is 97) plus 2, giving 99. The character corresponding to ASCII value 99 is `'c'`.

Therefore, `tmp` is set to `'c'`.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if `cur` has reached `(1 << k) - 1` at the end of the loop, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is `'c'`.**
