Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `ss` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'). If the bit in `cur` corresponding to the position `cur_ss` is 0, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss` and the bit in `cur` corresponding to the position `cur_ss` is now 1. If `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is now the string `ss`, and `cur` is 0. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97, `cur` is updated to have the bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1 if it was 0. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` contains the value of `cur_ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus 97. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` contains the string representation of `cur_ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged and `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
