Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from the new `s` that caused `cur` to reset to 0, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cur` is set to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
