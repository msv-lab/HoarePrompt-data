Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0.** 

The variable `cur` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged, and `cur` is now set to 0.
