The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the described parameter constraints and relationships, it appears to process multiple test cases. Each test case involves parameters `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
  - `k`: An integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
  - `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
  - `s`: A string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

The function processes these parameters and returns some output based on the given constraints. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s`. It returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
