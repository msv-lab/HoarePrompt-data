Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the first character of `ss` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a').** 

Explanation: The code snippet `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')` calculates the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of the string `ss` and the ASCII value of the character 'a'. This value is stored in the variable `cur_ss`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
