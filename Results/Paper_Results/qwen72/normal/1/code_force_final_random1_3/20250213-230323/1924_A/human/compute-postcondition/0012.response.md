Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set, and `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`.**
