The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `k` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 2, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.**
