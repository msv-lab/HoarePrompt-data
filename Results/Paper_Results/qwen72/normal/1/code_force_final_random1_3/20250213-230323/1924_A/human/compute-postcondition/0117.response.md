Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, if `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is further concatenated with the value of `tmp` (if `tmp` is not an empty string) and `'a'` repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times, `cur` is 0 if the last iteration of the loop caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed but did not cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cnt` is reset to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ans`, `cur`) retain their initial values or conditions as described in the initial state.
