Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `1 << cur_ss` plus `1 << cur_ss` if `cur` was not equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement, otherwise `cur` is 0. `cnt` remains 1 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement, otherwise `cnt` remains 0. `ans` remains the first two characters of `s` if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` at the start of the if statement, otherwise `ans` remains an empty string.***
