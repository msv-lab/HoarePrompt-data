Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string with at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur` is either 0 or remains unchanged, and `cur_ss` is either `ord(s[0]) - 97` if the bit corresponding to `ord(s[0]) - 97` was not set in `(1 << k) - 1` initially, or remains unchanged. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the string representation of `cur_ss`, and `cur` is set to 0.***
