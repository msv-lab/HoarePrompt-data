Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the third character of `s` minus 97. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` contains the string representation of `cur_ss`, and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged and `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string.***
