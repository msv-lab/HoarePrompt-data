Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt` is the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` has been met during the loop, `ans` is the concatenation of the characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur` is 0 if the last iteration of the loop caused `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise it is the bitwise OR of the positions of the characters in `s` that have been processed but did not cause `cur` to reach `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is 'b' if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0, otherwise `tmp` remains an empty string, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is 0.***
