Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `i` is `k + 1`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the second character of `s` minus 97 (which is the ASCII value of 'a'), `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `cur` is set to 0.
- All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
