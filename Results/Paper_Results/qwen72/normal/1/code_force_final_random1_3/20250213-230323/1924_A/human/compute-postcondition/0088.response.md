Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string with at least three characters, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`, and `ss` is the third character in the string `s`. If `cur == (1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is the third character in the string `s`. Otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
