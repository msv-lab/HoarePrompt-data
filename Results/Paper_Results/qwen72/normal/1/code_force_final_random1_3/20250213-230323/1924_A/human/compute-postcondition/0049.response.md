Output State: **`i` is 2, `tmp` is 'c', and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur`) remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The value of `i` is 2, and `tmp` is set to the character obtained by converting the ASCII value of 'a' plus 2 to a character, which results in 'c'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
