To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`obj`**: This is the first string in the `command` list.
2. **`com`**: This is the second string in the `command` list.
3. **`pos`**: This is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`. Assuming `elements` is a dictionary where keys are strings and values are tuples representing positions.
4. **`mov`**: This is a dictionary where keys are command strings and values are tuples representing movements. For example, `mov['up']` might be `(0, -1)`.
5. **`nxt`**: This is the new position calculated by adding the movement tuple from `mov[com]` to the current position `pos`.
6. **`player`**: This is determined by the function `isPlayer(obj)`. If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is the value at the new position `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

Given these definitions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
```

- **`time`**: This is a variable representing the current time. Its value is not explicitly provided in the initial state, so we will represent it as `time`.
- **`player`**: As described, `player` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, or the value at `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `False`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine `obj` and `com`**:
   - `obj` is the first string in `command`.
   - `com` is the second string in `command`.

2. **Determine `pos`**:
   - `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`.

3. **Determine `nxt`**:
   - `nxt` is calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.

4. **Determine `player`**:
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is `obj`.
   - Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

5. **Construct the Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the current `time` followed by the value of `player` and the string "ELIMINATED".

### Final Output:

Based on the initial state and the steps above, the output will be:

Output: **%d %s ELIMINATED (where %d is the value of `time` and %s is the value of `player`, which is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, or the value at `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `False`)**
