Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and `line[ind]: (1, 2)`. If `line[0]` is not '..' and `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` includes an entry for `line[0]` with the value `(1, 0)` and an entry for `line[1]` with the value `(1, 1)`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input and must have at least three elements, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. The first list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'B' and ends with 'G'. The second list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'R' and ends with 'G'. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player, `allPlayers` has the value `False` for `line[0]`, `line[1]`, and `line[2]`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player and the second character is 'G', the first list in `goal` also contains the tuple `(1, 0)`, and `tmp` is 0. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, 1)` appended to it. If `line[ind][1]` is not 'G', no changes are made to `goal` or `tmp`. `ind` is 2. `tmp` is 0 if `line[2][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. The tuple `(1, 2)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(1, 2)` to the list `goal[tmp]`.
- Since `ind` is 2 and `i` is 1, the tuple `(1, 2)` is added to the list `goal[tmp]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
