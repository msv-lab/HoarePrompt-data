Output State: **`obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The variable `nxt` is updated to a new tuple, which is calculated by adding the corresponding elements of `pos` and `mov[com]`. The values of `obj`, `com`, and `pos` remain the same as in the initial state.
