Output State: **`obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `player` is determined based on the condition `isPlayer(obj)`. If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is set to `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is set to the value at `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. All other variables (`obj`, `com`, `pos`, `nxt`) remain unchanged.
