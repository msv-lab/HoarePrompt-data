To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`command`**: This is a list of strings obtained from the input line. For example, `command` could be `['player', 'move']`.

2. **`obj`**: This is the first string in `command`. If `command` is `['player', 'move']`, then `obj` would be `'player'`.

3. **`com`**: This is the second string in `command`. If `command` is `['player', 'move']`, then `com` would be `'move'`.

4. **`pos`**: This is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`. For example, if `elements = {'player': (1, 2)}`, then `pos` would be `(1, 2)`.

5. **`mov`**: This is a dictionary that maps commands to movement vectors. For example, `mov = {'move': (0, 1), 'jump': (0, 2)}`.

6. **`nxt`**: This is a tuple calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `pos` is `(1, 2)` and `com` is `'move'`, and `mov['move']` is `(0, 1)`, then `nxt` would be `(1 + 0, 2 + 1)`, which is `(1, 3)`.

7. **`player`**: This is determined by the function `isPlayer(obj)`. If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

8. **`time`**: This is a variable representing the current time, which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is assumed to be available in the context.

Given these variables, the `print` statement is:
```python
print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
```

Let's assume the following values for the sake of this example:
- `command = ['player', 'move']`
- `elements = {'player': (1, 2)}`
- `mov = {'move': (0, 1)}`
- `isPlayer('player')` returns `True`
- `time = 10`

Step-by-step calculation:
1. `obj = 'player'`
2. `com = 'move'`
3. `pos = elements['player'] = (1, 2)`
4. `nxt = (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]) = (1 + 0, 2 + 1) = (1, 3)`
5. Since `isPlayer('player')` returns `True`, `player = obj = 'player'`
6. `time = 10`

Therefore, the `print` statement will output:
Output: **10 player ELIMINATED**
