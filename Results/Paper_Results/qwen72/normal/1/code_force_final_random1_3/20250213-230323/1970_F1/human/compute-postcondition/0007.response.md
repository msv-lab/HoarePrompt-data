The line of code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the resulting string into a list of substrings. This list is then assigned to the variable `line`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input.**
