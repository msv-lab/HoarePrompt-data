Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are specific integers read from the input, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`. For each string `s` in `line` that is not '..', `elements` has an entry `s: (0, index_of_s)`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input. `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. The first list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'B' and ends with 'G'. The second list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'R' and ends with 'G'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in `line` that is not '..' with the value `(1, index_of_s)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists. The first list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'B' and ends with 'G'. The second list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'R' and ends with 'G'. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..' and the second character is 'G', the tuple `(1, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the string is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new list `line` again, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in the new `line` that is not '..' with the value `(2, index_of_s)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a new list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in the new `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists. For each string `s` in `line` that is not '..' and is a player, `allPlayers[s]` is `False`. For each string `s` in `line` that is not '..' and has a second character 'G', the tuple `(2, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
