To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `team` is the index returned by `goalIn(pos)`.
   - `n` is a specific integer read from the input.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `m` is a specific integer read from the input.
   - `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of strings.
   - `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' with the value `(i, index_of_s)`.
   - `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]`.
   - `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in any `line` that represents a player, with the value `False` for `obj` and `False` for all other players.
   - `goal` is a list containing two lists. For each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' and has a second character 'G', the tuple `(i, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, and the length of `command` is not equal to 3.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `pos` is the coordinate pair `elements[obj]`.
   - `nxt` is the new position calculated as `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - Either `obj` is not equal to `.B` or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is not a player, and either `obj` is not a player or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.
   - The command `com` is 'T'.
   - The current position `pos` is a goal position, meaning `goalIn(pos)` returns a valid index (not -1).

2. **Relevant Code:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `team` is the index returned by `goalIn(pos)`. Since `pos` is a goal position, `goalIn(pos)` returns a valid index (not -1). This index corresponds to one of the teams (0 or 1).
   - `GoalName` is a list or dictionary that maps team indices to their names. The exact content of `GoalName` is not provided, but it is assumed to contain the names of the teams at indices 0 and 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will format the string with `time` and `GoalName[team]`.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `team` is the index returned by `goalIn(pos)`, which is a valid index (0 or 1).
   - `GoalName[team]` will be the name of the team corresponding to the index `team`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **0 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [GoalName[team]] is the name of the team corresponding to the index returned by `goalIn(pos)`)**
