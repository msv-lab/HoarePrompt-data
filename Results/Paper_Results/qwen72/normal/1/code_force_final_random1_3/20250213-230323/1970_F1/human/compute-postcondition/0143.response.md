Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to the variable `command`. Since no other operations are performed on the variables in the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged.
