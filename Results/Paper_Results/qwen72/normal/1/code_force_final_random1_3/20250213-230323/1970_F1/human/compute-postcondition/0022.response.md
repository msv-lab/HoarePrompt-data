Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entries `'.B': (-1, -1)` and `line[ind]: (0, 1)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input that must have at least two strings, and `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` represents a player (as determined by the function `isPlayer`), `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the entry `line[ind]: False`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary `{}`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `goal` is a list containing two lists, where the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.**
