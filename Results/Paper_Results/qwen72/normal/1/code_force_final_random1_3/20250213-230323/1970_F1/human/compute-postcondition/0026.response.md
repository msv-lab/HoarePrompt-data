Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entries `'.B': (-1, -1)` and `line[ind]: (0, 1)`, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input that must have at least two strings, `ind` is 1, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the entry `line[ind]: False` if `line[ind]` represents a player, otherwise `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary `{}`, `goal` is a list containing two lists. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(0, 1)` appended to its existing list. Otherwise, `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.***
