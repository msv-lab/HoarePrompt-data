Output State: **`obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`**. 

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the function `goalIn(pos)` to the variable `team`. All other variables (`obj`, `com`, `pos`, `nxt`, and `allPlayers[obj]`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `team` is now the result of the function call `goalIn(pos)`.
