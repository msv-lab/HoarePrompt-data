Output State: **`n` is a specific integer read from the input, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input. `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' with the value `(i, index_of_s)`, where `i` is the iteration index and `index_of_s` is the index of the string `s` in the corresponding `line`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams. `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in any `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. For each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' and has a second character 'G', the tuple `(i, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. `t` is an integer read from the input.**
