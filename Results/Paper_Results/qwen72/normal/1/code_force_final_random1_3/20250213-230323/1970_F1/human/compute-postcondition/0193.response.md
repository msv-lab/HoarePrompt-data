Postcondition: ***`command` is a list of strings. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element, `com` is the second element, and `el` is the third element. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is '.S', `team` is set to 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string, `pos` is the value associated with `obj` in the dictionary `elements`, and `nxt` is `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj == '.B' and (isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt))`, then `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj == '.B' and com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `obj == '.B' and goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `obj == '.B' and com` is not 'T' and `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is not '.B', all other variables remain unchanged. `time` is `x + 1`, and `t` must be greater than `x + 1`.***
