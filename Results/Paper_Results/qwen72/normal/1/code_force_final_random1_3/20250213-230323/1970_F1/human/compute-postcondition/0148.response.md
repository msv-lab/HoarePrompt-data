To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`command`**: This is a list of strings obtained from the input line. For example, it might look like `['B', 'catch', 'snitch']`.

2. **`obj`**: This is the first element of `command`. In the example, `obj` would be `'B'`.

3. **`com`**: This is the second element of `command`. In the example, `com` would be `'catch'`.

4. **`el`**: This is the third element of `command`. In the example, `el` would be `'snitch'`.

5. **`team`**: This is determined based on the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0]` is `'B'`, then `team` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `team` is set to `0`. In the example, since `obj` is `'B'`, `team` is `1`.

6. **`points[team]`**: This is incremented by 10. Since `team` is `1`, `points[1]` is incremented by 10. The exact value of `points[1]` before this increment is not specified, but it will be increased by 10.

7. **`time`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a variable that holds a numeric value representing time. For the purpose of this explanation, let's assume `time` is `120` (this is just an example).

8. **`GoalName`**: This is a list of strings where `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]` are the names of the goals for team 0 and team 1, respectively. For the purpose of this explanation, let's assume `GoalName` is `['Team A', 'Team B']`.

Given these assumptions, the `print` statement will format the output as follows:

```python
print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

Substituting the values:
- `time` is `120` (example value).
- `team` is `1` (since `obj` is `'B'`).
- `GoalName[1]` is `'Team B'` (example value).

The output will be:
Output: **120 Team B CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
