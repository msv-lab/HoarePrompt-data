Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` also has the entry `line[ind]: (0, 0)`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input that must have at least one string, and `ind` is 0. If `line[ind]` represents a player (as determined by the function `isPlayer`), `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the entry `line[ind]: False`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary `{}`. If `line[ind]` is not a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `goal` is a list containing two lists, where the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` also has the entry `line[ind]: (0, 1)`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input that must have at least two strings, and `ind` is 1. If `line[ind]` represents a player, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the entry `line[ind]: False`. If `line[ind]` does not represent a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `goal` is a list containing two lists, where the first list is empty and the second list contains the tuple `(0, 0)`. If `line[ind]` does not represent a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is not 'G', `goal` is a list containing two empty lists. If `line[ind]` does not represent a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(0, 1)` appended to its existing list. If `line[ind]` is '..', `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary `{}` and `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)`. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` also has the entry `line[ind]: (0, 2)`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input that must have at least two strings, and `ind` is 2. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the entry `line[2]: False` if `line[2]` represents a player, otherwise `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary `{}`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. If `line[2]` represents a player, `goal` remains unchanged. If `line[2]` does not represent a player and the second character of `line[2]` is 'G', `goal` contains the tuple `(0, 0)` in the second list if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', otherwise it contains the tuple `(0, 2)` in the appropriate list based on the first character of `line[2]`. If `line[ind]` is '..', `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary `{}` and `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
