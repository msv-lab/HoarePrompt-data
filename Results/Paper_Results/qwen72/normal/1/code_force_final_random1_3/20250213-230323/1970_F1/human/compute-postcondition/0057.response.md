Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an updated entry for `line[0]` with the value `(1, 0)` if `line[0]` is not '..'. Additionally, `elements` now includes an entry for `line[1]` with the value `(1, 1)`. `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]` representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading and splitting a line from standard input and must have at least two elements, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. The first list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'B' and ends with 'G'. The second list contains tuples `(0, index_of_s)` for each string `s` in `line` that starts with 'R' and ends with 'G'. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player, `allPlayers` has the value `False` for `line[0]`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player and the second character is 'G', the first list in `goal` also contains the tuple `(1, 0)`, and `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. `ind` is 1. `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, 1)` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`.
- Given that `i` is 1 and `ind` is 1, the tuple `(1, 1)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
