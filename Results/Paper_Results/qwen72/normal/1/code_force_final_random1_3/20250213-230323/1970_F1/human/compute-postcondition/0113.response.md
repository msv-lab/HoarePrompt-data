The code snippet `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. The value of `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`. If the first character of `obj` is 'B', `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a specific integer read from the input.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `m` is a specific integer read from the input.
- `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of strings.
- `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' with the value `(i, index_of_s)`.
- `points` is a list of two integers `[0, 0]`.
- `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in any `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`.
- `goal` is a list containing two lists. For each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' and has a second character 'G', the tuple `(i, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `time` is 0.
- `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, and the length of `command` is 3.
- `obj` is the first element of `command`.
- `com` is the second element of `command`.
- `el` is the third element of `command`, and `el` is equal to `.S`.
- `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.

After executing the code snippet:
- If the first character of `obj` is 'B', `team` is 1, and `points[1]` is incremented by 10.
- If the first character of `obj` is not 'B', `team` is 0, and `points[0]` is incremented by 10.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a specific integer read from the input, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is a specific integer read from the input, `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each of which is a list of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with the entry `'.B': (-1, -1)` and an entry for each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' with the value `(i, index_of_s)`, `points` is a list of two integers where `points[team]` is increased by 10, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with entries for each string `s` in any `line` that represents a player, with the value `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists. For each string `s` in any `line` that is not '..' and has a second character 'G', the tuple `(i, index_of_s)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings obtained from the input line, and the length of `command` is 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, and `el` is equal to `.S`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.**
