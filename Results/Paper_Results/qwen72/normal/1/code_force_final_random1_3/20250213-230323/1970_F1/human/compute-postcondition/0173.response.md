The code snippet `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. The value of `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`. If the first character of `obj` is 'B', `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0. Therefore, the specific value of `points[team]` will depend on whether `team` is 0 or 1.

Output State: **`obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element, `el` is the third element, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, `points[team]` is increased by 10.**
