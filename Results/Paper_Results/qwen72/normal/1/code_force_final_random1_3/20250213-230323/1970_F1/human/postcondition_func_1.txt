The function `goalIn` takes a single parameter `pos`, which is a tuple of integers representing a position on the field. It checks whether `pos` is in the first set of `goal` (representing the red team's goals), the second set of `goal` (representing the blue team's goals), or neither. The function returns 0 if `pos` is in the first set, 1 if `pos` is in the second set, and -1 if `pos` is not in either set.
