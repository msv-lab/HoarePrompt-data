Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`, but the implementation modifies the string `s` in a way that does not match the required decoding logic. Specifically, the function replaces each character in `s` with the last unique character in `unique_chars` and then decrements `j`, which is not the correct approach for decoding. Additionally, the function returns a string of unique characters in the order they first appeared, which is not the intended output.

The correct approach should involve creating a mapping from the characters in the encoded string to their corresponding characters in the original string based on the symmetric positions in the sorted unique characters. This mapping should then be used to replace each character in the encoded string to get the original string.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
