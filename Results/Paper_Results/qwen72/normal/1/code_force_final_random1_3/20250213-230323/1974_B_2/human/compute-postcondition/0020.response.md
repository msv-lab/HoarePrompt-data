The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string where all occurrences of `char` have been replaced with `unique_chars[j+1]`, `char` is the next character in the updated string `s`, and `j` is now `j - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string where all occurrences of `char` have been replaced with `unique_chars[j+1]`, `char` is the next character in the updated string `s`, and `j` is now `j - 1`.**
