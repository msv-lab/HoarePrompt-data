Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to decode an encoded string according to the specified algorithm. However, there are several issues with the implementation of `func_1` that prevent it from correctly performing the decoding:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Decoding**: The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`. However, the current logic inside `func_1` does not follow the decoding process described in the problem statement. Instead, it attempts to replace characters in `s` with characters from the end of the `unique_chars` list, which is not the correct approach for decoding.

2. **Modification of Input String**: The function modifies the input string `s` directly, which is not necessary for the decoding process. The input string should remain unchanged, and a new decoded string should be constructed.

3. **Insertion of Characters**: The function includes logic to insert characters into `unique_chars`, which is not part of the decoding algorithm. This insertion logic is unnecessary and incorrect.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `unique_chars` joined into a string, which is not the decoded string but rather a string of unique characters in the order they appear in the input string.

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
- Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters of `b` in alphabetical order.
- Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.
- Use this mapping to construct the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character in the mapping.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
