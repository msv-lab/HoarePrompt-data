Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1, `char` is the first character in `s`, `char` is now in `unique_chars` at index `i + 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so the new index `i` is `i + 1`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
