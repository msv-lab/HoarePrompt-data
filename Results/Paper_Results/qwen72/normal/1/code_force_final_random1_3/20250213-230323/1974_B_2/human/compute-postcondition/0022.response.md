The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1. `char` is the next character in the string `s`. `unique_chars` now contains `char` inserted at index `i-1`.
