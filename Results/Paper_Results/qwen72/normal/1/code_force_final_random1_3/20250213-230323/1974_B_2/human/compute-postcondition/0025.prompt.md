Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5; unique_chars is a sorted list of unique characters from s; i is 0; j is len(unique_chars) - 1.
Code of the loop:
for char in s:
    if char in unique_chars:
        s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
        j -= 1
    else:
        unique_chars.insert(i, char)
        i += 1
        j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1. If `char` (the first character in the original `s`) is in the set of unique characters (`unique_chars`), all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, and `j` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `char` is added to `unique_chars` at index `i + 1`, and `j` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` have been replaced with `unique_chars[j+1]`, and `char` is the next character in the updated string `s`, with `j` being `j - 1`. Otherwise, `char` is added to `unique_chars` at index `i-1`, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` is at least 1. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, all occurrences of `char` in `s` have been replaced with `unique_chars[j+1]`, `char` is the next character in the updated string `s`, and `j` is now `j - 1`. Otherwise, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `unique_chars` now contains `char` inserted at index `i-1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
