Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to the maximum value between the current `ans` and `i`.
- Since `i` is 2 and `ans` was initially 1, `ans` is updated to 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `q`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))` is still valid.
- The condition for setting `ans` to `x` is not directly affected by this line of code, so it remains as described in the initial state.
