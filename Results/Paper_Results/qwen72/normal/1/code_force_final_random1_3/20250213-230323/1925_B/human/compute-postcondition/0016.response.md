Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, and `i` is greater than 0, then `ans` is set to the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
