The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum value between the current value of `ans` and `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1
- `n` is the second integer from the input
- `q` is 0
- `i` is 3
- `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x))`
- If `x` is divisible by `i` and `(x - n * (x // i))` is non-negative, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum value between 1 and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.

The code snippet `ans = max(ans, i)` will update `ans` to be the maximum value between the current value of `ans` and `i`. Since `i` is 3, and the initial value of `ans` is 1 (or possibly `x // 2` if the conditions are met), the new value of `ans` will be 3 if `i` is greater than the current value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `q` is 0, `i` is 3, `ans` is 3 (if `i` is greater than the initial value of `ans`), otherwise `ans` remains the same.**
