### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with characters `<` and `>`. The pinball moves left or right based on the character and flips the character after moving.

2. **Algorithm Overview**:
   - The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to precompute the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid from the left and right sides, respectively.
   - `A` is computed for positions where the character is `>`.
   - `B` is computed for positions where the character is `<`.

3. **Precomputation**:
   - For `A`:
     - Iterate from left to right.
     - If the character is `>`, compute the steps required to reach the next `>` or the boundary.
   - For `B`:
     - Iterate from right to left.
     - If the character is `<`, compute the steps required to reach the next `<` or the boundary.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each starting position, use the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the total steps.
   - The logic involves checking the current character and using the appropriate precomputed values to calculate the total steps.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary provided is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not calculate the minimum number of swaps to balance the string. Instead, it computes the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - The function correctly processes the string to compute the required steps for each position.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball might leave the grid immediately or after a few steps.
   - The precomputation ensures that the program can handle large inputs efficiently.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The precomputation steps are linear in terms of the length of the string `s`.
   - The query handling is also linear, making the overall complexity \(O(n)\) for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for solving the problem as described. The precomputation and query handling are well-structured and should handle the given constraints efficiently.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct. The function summary provided was misleading, but the actual implementation of `func_1` aligns with the problem requirements.
