To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
   - `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.

2. **Evaluate the Expression:**
   - `B[len(B) - 1]`: This accesses the last element of the list `B`.
   - `idx_B[len(B) - 1]`: This accesses the last element of the list `idx_B`.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `len(idx_B)`: This gives the length of the list `idx_B`.

3. **Calculate the New Value of `x`:**
   - `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`

### Calculation:
- Let `B[len(B) - 1]` be denoted as `B_last`.
- Let `idx_B[len(B) - 1]` be denoted as `idx_B_last`.
- Let `len(idx_B)` be denoted as `len_idx_B`.

The new value of `x` is:
\[ x = B_{\text{last}} + (idx_B_{\text{last}} - (n - 3)) \times len(idx_B) \]

### Output State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged.
- `x` is now \( B_{\text{last}} + (idx_B_{\text{last}} - (n - 3)) \times len(idx_B) \).

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 3`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, `x` is \( B_{\text{last}} + (idx_B_{\text{last}} - (n - 3)) \times len(idx_B) \).**
