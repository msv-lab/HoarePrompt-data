To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `a` is the value of `A[l]`.
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.
- `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x` is less than 0, otherwise `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as `1`.
   - `a` is the value of `A[l]`, where `l` is an index into the list `A`.
   - `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`.
   - `b` is determined based on the value of `x`:
     - If `x < 0`, then `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
     - Otherwise, `b = B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.

2. **Expression to Print:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - Since `i` is `1`, the expression simplifies to `a * 2 + b * 2 + 1 + 1`, which is `a * 2 + b * 2 + 2`.

### Output:
The final output will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b` derived from the initial state. However, without the exact values of `l` and `r`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + 2 (where a is the value of A[l], b is the value of B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) if x >= 0, otherwise b is (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1), and x is r - (l + 2))**
