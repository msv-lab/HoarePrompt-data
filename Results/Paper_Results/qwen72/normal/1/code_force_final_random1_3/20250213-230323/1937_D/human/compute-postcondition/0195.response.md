Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `2`, `r` is one less than its original value, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is updated to `b - A[l - r - 2]`.
- All other variables (`s`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, `idx_B`, `j`, `i`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `b` is calculated as the original value of `b` minus the value of `A[l - r - 2]`.
