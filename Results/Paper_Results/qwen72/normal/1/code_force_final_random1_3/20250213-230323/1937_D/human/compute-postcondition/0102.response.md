To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `l` is `0`.
- `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s` minus 1.
- `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
- The character at index `i` of `s` is '<'.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i = 0`
   - `l = 0`
   - `r = number of '<' characters in `s` - 1`
   - `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. Since `l = 0`, `l - 1` is `-1`, and `A[-1]` is not defined. Therefore, `a` is undefined or should be handled as a special case.
   - `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. Since `l = 0`, this simplifies to `b = b + 0`, so `b` remains unchanged.
   - The character at index `i` of `s` is '<'.

2. **Calculating `a` and `b`:**
   - Since `l = 0`, `a` is undefined because it references `A[-1]`.
   - `b` remains unchanged because the update term `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` is zero.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`.
   - Since `a` is undefined, the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` cannot be evaluated directly.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `a` is undefined due to the reference to `A[-1]`. Therefore, the print statement will result in an error or an undefined behavior.

However, if we assume that the code handles the undefined case gracefully (e.g., setting `a` to 0 or another default value), the output would be:

Output: **undefined (or an error message due to undefined `a`)**

If we assume a default value for `a` (e.g., `a = 0`), then the output would be:

Output: **1 (assuming `a = 0` and `b = 0`)**

But since the problem specifies the initial state without handling undefined cases, the most precise answer is:

Output: **undefined (or an error message due to undefined `a`)**
