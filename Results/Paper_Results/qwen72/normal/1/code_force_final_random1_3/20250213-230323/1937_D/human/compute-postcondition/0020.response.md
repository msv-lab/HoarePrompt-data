The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `s[1]` is '>', then `idx_A` is [0, 1] and `A` is [0, 1]. If `s[1]` is not '>', then `idx_A` and `A` remain empty lists.**
