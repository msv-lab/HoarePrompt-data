The code snippet `idx_A.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. Given the initial conditions:

- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is a list containing [0], and `idx_A` is a list containing [0] if the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', otherwise `A` is a list containing [0] and `idx_A` remains an empty list.
- If `len(idx_A) != 0`, then if `s[1]` is '>', `idx_A` is [0], `A` is [0, 1], and `x` is 1. If `s[1]` is not '>', `idx_A` is an empty list, `A` is [1], and the calculation of `x` will raise an error.

Given these conditions, the value of `i` is 1, and `idx_A` is either [0] or an empty list depending on the character at index 1 of `s`.

### Impact of the Code:
- `idx_A.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to `idx_A`.

### Calculation:
- If `s[1]` is '>', then `idx_A` was initially [0]. After appending `i` (which is 1), `idx_A` becomes [0, 1].
- If `s[1]` is not '>', then `idx_A` was initially an empty list. After appending `i` (which is 1), `idx_A` becomes [1].

### Output State:
- If `s[1]` is '>', then `idx_A` is [0, 1], `A` is [0, 1], `x` is 1, `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1.
- If `s[1]` is not '>', then `idx_A` is [1], `A` is [1], `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **If `s[1]` is '>', then `idx_A` is [0, 1], `A` is [0, 1], `x` is 1, `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `s[1]` is not '>', then `idx_A` is [1], `A` is [1], `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1.**
