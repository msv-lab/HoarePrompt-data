To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

- The variable `i` is initialized to `-1` before the loop starts, but within the loop, it will be set to `0` as the loop begins.
- The variable `n` represents the length of the string `s`, and for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `0`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than `0`, and `i` should be set to `0` at the start of the loop.

State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `r` is the number of '<' characters in `s`.**
