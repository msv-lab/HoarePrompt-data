Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is not empty, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', and `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` which simplifies to `0 + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)` since `A` is an empty list and `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `A` is an empty list, so `A[len(A) - 1]` is 0 (since accessing an element from an empty list would normally raise an error, but here it is assumed to be 0).
- `i` is 0.
- `idx_A` is not empty, so `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` is the last element of `idx_A`.
- `len(idx_A)` is the length of `idx_A`.
- Therefore, `x` is calculated as `0 + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, which simplifies to `(0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
