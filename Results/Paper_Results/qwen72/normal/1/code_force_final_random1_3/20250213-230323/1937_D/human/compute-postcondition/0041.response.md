To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- If the character at position `i` in `s` is '<', `idx_B` is now `[n - 1]`.
- If `len(idx_B)` was 0, `B` is a list containing `[0]` and `idx_B` is now `[n - 1]`.
- Otherwise, `B` is updated to `[B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)]`, and `idx_B` is now `[n - 1]`.
- If the character at position `i` in `s` is not '<', the lists `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- The loop head is `for j in range(0, n):`, which means the loop will continue as long as `j < n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
- The condition `j < n` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. Since `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Updated State:
- `s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- The lists `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged based on the conditions described.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, `B` and `idx_B` remain unchanged based on the conditions described.**
