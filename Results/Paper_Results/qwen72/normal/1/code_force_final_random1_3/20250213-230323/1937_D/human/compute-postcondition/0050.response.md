Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 3`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged, `x` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `i = n - 1 - j` updates the value of `i`.
- Given `j` is 2, the new value of `i` is `n - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 3`.
- All other variables (`s`, `n`, `j`, `A`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `B`, and `x`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
