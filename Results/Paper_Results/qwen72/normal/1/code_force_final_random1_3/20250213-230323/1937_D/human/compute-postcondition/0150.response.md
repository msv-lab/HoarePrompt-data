To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression inside the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `r` is decreased by 1.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```python
print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable Values:**
   - `n`: Length of the string `s`.
   - `i`: 1 (as given).
   - `l`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the expression. We need to assume it is a valid index for `idx_A`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `n - i`: Since `i` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1`.
   - `i - idx_A[l - 1]`: Here, `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the (l-1)-th '>' character in the string `s`. Since `i` is 1, this term represents the difference between 1 and the index of the (l-1)-th '>' character.
   - `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: This term calculates twice the difference between 1 and the index of the (l-1)-th '>' character.
   - `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: Combining the above, this expression becomes `n - 1 + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

3. **Simplification:**
   - `n - 1 + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`
   - `n - 1 + 2 - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]`
   - `n + 1 - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]`

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of the expression `n + 1 - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]`.

Output: **n + 1 - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]** (where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the (l-1)-th '>' character in the string `s`).
