Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The program processes multiple test cases, reads the grid configuration, and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each starting position. The logic for handling the pinball's movement and the inversion of the grid cells is complex but seems to be implemented accurately based on the problem statement. The use of two lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative effects of the pinball's movements and the positions where the direction changes are key to solving the problem efficiently. The program also handles edge cases, such as when the pinball starts at the boundary or when there are no more direction changes to consider. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
