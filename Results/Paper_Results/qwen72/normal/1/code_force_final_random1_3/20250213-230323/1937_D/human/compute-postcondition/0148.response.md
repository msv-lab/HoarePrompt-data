To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `A` is a list containing the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` is a list containing the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `1`.
- `r` is unchanged.
- `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is calculated as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.

### Variables Involved in the Print Statement:
- `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
- `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
- `i` is `1`.

### Calculation:
1. **Value of `a`**:
   - `A[l - 1]` is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to the `(l - 1)`-th position in `A`.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the `(l - 1)`-th '>' character in `s`.
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `l` is the length of the segment being considered (not explicitly given, but assumed to be part of the context).

   Therefore, `a = A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.

2. **Value of `b`**:
   - `B[r]` is the cumulative count of '<' characters from the end up to the `r`-th position in `B`.
   - `B[r - l]` is the cumulative count of '<' characters from the end up to the `(r - l)`-th position in `B`.
   - `idx_B[r - l]` is the index of the `(r - l)`-th '<' character in `s` (in reverse order).
   - `idx_B[r]` is the index of the `r`-th '<' character in `s` (in reverse order).
   - `r` is the position from the end of the string.
   - `l` is the length of the segment being considered.

   Therefore, `b = B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l`.

3. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `a * 2` is `2 * (A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l)`.
     - `b * 2` is `2 * (B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l)`.
     - `i + 1` is `1 + 1 = 2`.

### Final Output:
The exact numerical values of `a` and `b` depend on the specific values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `l`, and `r`. However, the structure of the output is clear.

Output: **2 * (A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) + 2 * (B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 1) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 1) * l) + 2**
