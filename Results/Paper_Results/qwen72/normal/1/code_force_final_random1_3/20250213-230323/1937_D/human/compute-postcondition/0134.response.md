The value of `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its current value. The value of `a` remains updated to the previously calculated value, and `b` is initially equal to `A[l - 1]`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` was further updated to `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. After the given code snippet, `b` is now `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

Output State: **The value of `a` is updated to the calculated value, `b` is now equal to `A[l - 1]` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, `b` is further updated to `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
