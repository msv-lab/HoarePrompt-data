### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with characters `<` and `>`.
   - The pinball moves left or right based on the character and the character is flipped after each move.
   - The goal is to determine the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Algorithm Overview**:
   - The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to precompute the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid from the left and right sides, respectively.
   - `A` is computed for positions where the character is `>`.
   - `B` is computed for positions where the character is `<`.

3. **Precomputation**:
   - For `A`:
     - Iterate from left to right.
     - If the character is `>`, compute the steps required to reach the next `>` or the boundary.
   - For `B`:
     - Iterate from right to left.
     - If the character is `<`, compute the steps required to reach the next `<` or the boundary.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each starting position, use the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the total steps.
   - The logic involves checking the current character and using the appropriate precomputed values to calculate the total steps.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball might leave the grid immediately or after a few steps.
   - The precomputation ensures that the program can handle large inputs efficiently.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The precomputation steps are linear in terms of the length of the string `s`.
   - The query handling is also linear, making the overall complexity \(O(n)\) for each test case.

### Evaluation of the Program:

- **Correctness of Precomputation**:
  - The precomputation for `A` and `B` is done correctly. The lists `A` and `B` store the cumulative counts of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid from the left and right sides, respectively.
  - The indices `idx_A` and `idx_B` are used to keep track of the positions of `>` and `<` characters, which is essential for the correct calculation of steps.

- **Correctness of Query Handling**:
  - The logic for handling each query is complex but follows the correct approach. It uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the total steps required for the pinball to leave the grid.
  - The program correctly handles different scenarios, such as when the pinball leaves the grid immediately or after multiple steps.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases where the grid consists entirely of `>` or `<` characters.
  - It also handles cases where the pinball might leave the grid from either side.

- **Overall Structure**:
  - The program is well-structured and follows a logical flow. The precomputation and query handling are separated, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. The precomputation and query handling are well-structured and should handle the given constraints efficiently.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
