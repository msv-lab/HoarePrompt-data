Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `A` is a list containing [0], `idx_A` is a list containing [0] if the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', otherwise `A` is a list containing [0] and `idx_A` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` must be greater than 1.
- The initial state also specifies that `i` is 1.
- If the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', then `idx_A` is a list containing [0].
- If `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `A` is a list containing [0]. Otherwise, `A` is a list containing one element `[x]`, where `x` is calculated as `(0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- The code snippet `A.append(0)` appends the value 0 to the list `A`.

Therefore, after executing the code snippet:
- If the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `A` becomes a list containing [0, 0] and `idx_A` remains [0].
- If the character at index `i` of `s` is not '>', `A` becomes a list containing [0] and `idx_A` remains an empty list.
