Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at position `i` in `s` is '<'. If `len(idx_B)` is 0, `B` is a list containing `[0]` and `idx_B` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is updated to `[B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)]`, and `idx_B` remains an empty list.***
