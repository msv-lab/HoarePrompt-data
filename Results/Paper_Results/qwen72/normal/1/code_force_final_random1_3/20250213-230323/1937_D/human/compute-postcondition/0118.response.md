Postcondition: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `0`. If `s[i]` is '>', `l` is incremented by 1. If `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[0]`, `x` is `r - 2`, and `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. If `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and `r` is 0, there are no '<' characters in the string `s`. If `r` is greater than 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `s[i]` is '<', `r` is decremented by 1. If `l` is 0, the state remains unchanged. If `l` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is 0, then `l` is greater than `r`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and `l` is greater than `r`. If the difference between `l` and `r` is not greater than 1, the values of `l`, `r`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
