Output State: **s is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is the length of s, A is an empty list, idx_A is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `idx_A` and assigns it an empty list. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `A`. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `s`, `n`, and `A`, along with the new initialization of `idx_A` as an empty list.
