To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters.
- `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order.
- `j` is `n`.
- `i` is `2`.
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`.
- `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

### Variables Involved:
- `a` is calculated using the formula: `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`.
- `b` is calculated using the formula: `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `i` is `2`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

### Calculation:
1. **Calculate `a`**:
   - `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * r`
   - Here, `r` is not explicitly defined, but it is likely a parameter or a derived value from the context. Without the exact value of `r`, we can't compute `a` precisely.

2. **Calculate `b`**:
   - `b = A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`
   - Similarly, `l` and `r` are not explicitly defined, so we can't compute `b` precisely.

3. **Final Expression**:
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`
   - Since `i` is `2`, the expression simplifies to `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 2)`.

### Output:
Given the lack of specific values for `r`, `l`, and the exact contents of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 2)) (where a and b are calculated based on the given formulas, and n is the length of the string s)**
