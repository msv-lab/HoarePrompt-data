Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s`. The list `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters. The list `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`. The list `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters. The list `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order. The variable `j` is `n`, the variable `i` is `-1`, and the variable `l` is `0`.**
