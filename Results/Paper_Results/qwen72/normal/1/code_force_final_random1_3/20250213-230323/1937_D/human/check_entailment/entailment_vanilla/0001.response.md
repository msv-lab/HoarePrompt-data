### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` where each cell contains either `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the direction of the cell and inverts the direction after moving.
   - The goal is to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.

2. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to precompute the cumulative effects of the pinball movements.
   - `A` is used to store the cumulative effect of movements to the right.
   - `B` is used to store the cumulative effect of movements to the left.
   - These arrays are then used to compute the time for each starting position.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `A` and `B` are initialized as empty lists.
     - `idx_A` and `idx_B` are used to keep track of the indices of `>` and `<` respectively.
   - **Precomputation:**
     - For `A`, the program iterates from left to right, updating the cumulative effect of movements to the right.
     - For `B`, the program iterates from right to left, updating the cumulative effect of movements to the left.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - For each starting position `i`, the program determines the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball might leave the grid immediately or after a few steps.
   - The logic ensures that the pinball's movement and inversion are correctly accounted for.

5. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - The precomputation steps (building `A` and `B`) take linear time, O(n).
   - Each query is processed in constant time, O(1), using the precomputed values.
   - The overall complexity is efficient, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.

6. **Verification:**
   - The provided example and the expected output match the results produced by the program.
   - The program correctly handles the inversion of directions and the cumulative effects of movements.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed reasoning and verification, the given program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
