Output State: **`s` remains a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `B` contains the cumulative counts of '<' characters encountered from the end of the string, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '<' characters, `idx_B` contains the indices of all '<' characters in `s` in reverse order, `j` is `n`, `i` is `2`, `a` is the value of `A[l]`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `A[l]`, where `l` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `l` is used as an index in `A`, it must be a valid index within the bounds of the list `A`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
