The code snippet `idx_B.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters.
- `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- The character at position `i` in `s` is '<'.
- If `len(idx_B)` is 0, `B` is a list containing `[0]` and `idx_B` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `B` is updated to `[B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)]`, and `idx_B` remains an empty list.

After executing `idx_B.append(i)`:
- `i` is appended to `idx_B`.
- The value of `i` is `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `A` contains the cumulative counts of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of previous '>' characters, `idx_A` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at position `i` in `s` is '<', `idx_B` is now `[n - 1]`. If `len(idx_B)` was 0, `B` is a list containing `[0]` and `idx_B` is now `[n - 1]`. Otherwise, `B` is updated to `[B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)]`, and `idx_B` is now `[n - 1]`.**
