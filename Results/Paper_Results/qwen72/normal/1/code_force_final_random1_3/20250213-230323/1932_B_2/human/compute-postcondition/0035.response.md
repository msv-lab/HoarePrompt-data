Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `year` is the sum of each element in the list `a` plus the remainder of `year` divided by each element in the list `a` if it is non-zero.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `year` will be the sum of each element in the list `a` plus any non-zero remainders from dividing `year` by each element in the list `a`. The conditions for `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, with `a` needing to have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop has completed.
