Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the signs occur sequentially but the year calculation is incorrect due to the logic used. Specifically, the line `year += year % ai or ai` does not correctly compute the next year for the next sign to occur. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 3 4
```
The expected output should be `12`, but the program outputs `9`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:
- For the first sign (2), the year is `2`.
- For the second sign (3), the program calculates `2 + (2 % 3)` which is `2 + 2 = 4`. However, the correct year should be `6` because the second sign should occur in the next multiple of 3 after 2, which is 6.
- For the third sign (4), the program calculates `4 + (4 % 4)` which is `4 + 0 = 4`. However, the correct year should be `12` because the third sign should occur in the next multiple of 4 after 6, which is 12.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the sequential occurrence of signs and fails to produce the correct year for the nth sign to occur.
