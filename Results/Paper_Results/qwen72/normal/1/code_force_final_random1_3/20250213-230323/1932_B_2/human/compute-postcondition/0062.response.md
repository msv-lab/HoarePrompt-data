Output State: **`current_year` is now equal to `next_year`, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes the previous `current_year` as its last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must be an iterable with at least one more element, `ai` is the next element of `a`, `next_year` is now equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**

Explanation:
- The code `next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai` updates the value of `next_year` based on the current values of `current_year` and `ai`.
- The floor division `current_year // ai` gives the largest integer less than or equal to the division of `current_year` by `ai`.
- Adding 1 to the result of the floor division ensures that `next_year` is the next multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`.
- Multiplying this result by `ai` gives the new value of `next_year`.
- All other variables (`current_year`, `test_cases`, `test`, `results`, `n`, `a`, and `ai`) remain unchanged, but their relationships and constraints are still valid.
