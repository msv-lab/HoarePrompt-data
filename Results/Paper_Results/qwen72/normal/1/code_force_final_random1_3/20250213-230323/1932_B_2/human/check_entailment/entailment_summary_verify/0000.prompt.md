You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of a number of signs and their periodicities. For each test case, it calculates a specific value (`year`) based on the periodicities and prints this value. The function does not return any values; instead, it outputs the results directly to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the signs occur sequentially but the year calculation is incorrect due to the logic used. Specifically, the line `year += year % ai or ai` does not correctly compute the next year for the next sign to occur. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 3 4
```
The expected output should be `12`, but the program outputs `9`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:
- For the first sign (2), the year is `2`.
- For the second sign (3), the program calculates `2 + (2 % 3)` which is `2 + 2 = 4`. However, the correct year should be `6` because the second sign should occur in the next multiple of 3 after 2, which is 6.
- For the third sign (4), the program calculates `4 + (4 % 4)` which is `4 + 0 = 4`. However, the correct year should be `12` because the third sign should occur in the next multiple of 4 after 6, which is 12.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the sequential occurrence of signs and fails to produce the correct year for the nth sign to occur.
