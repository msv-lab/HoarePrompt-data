Postcondition: ***`a` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `current_year` is updated based on the last element of `a`, and `ai` is the next element in `a`. If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is set to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.***
