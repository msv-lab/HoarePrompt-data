Output State: **`current_year` is set to `next_year`, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `test` is the next element in `test_cases`, `results` now includes the previous `current_year` as its last element, `n` is the first element of the tuple `test`, `a` is the second element of the tuple `test` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `test_cases`, `test`, and `results` remain unchanged except for the changes mentioned above, `ai` is the first element of `a`. If the previous `current_year` was divisible by `ai`, `next_year` was set to `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` was set to the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than the previous `current_year`.**
