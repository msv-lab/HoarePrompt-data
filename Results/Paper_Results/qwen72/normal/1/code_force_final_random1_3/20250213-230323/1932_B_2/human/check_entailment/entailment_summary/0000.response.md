Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the rules that each sign must occur sequentially and strictly after the previous one has occurred. The logic used in the program is to accumulate the `year` variable by adding either `ai` (if `year % ai == 0`) or `year % ai` to ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the sequential nature of the signs. Specifically, the expression `year += year % ai or ai` does not always advance the year correctly to the next occurrence of the sign after the last sign's year.

To correctly implement the logic, the program should find the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current `year`. This can be done using the formula `year = ((year // ai) + 1) * ai`.

Given the provided execution summary and the problem description, the current implementation does not correctly handle the sequential and strict after conditions for the signs, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
