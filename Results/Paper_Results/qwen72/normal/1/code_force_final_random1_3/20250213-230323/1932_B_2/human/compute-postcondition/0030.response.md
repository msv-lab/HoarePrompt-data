The value of `year` is updated by adding the result of the expression `year % ai or ai`. Since `year` is initially 0, `year % ai` will also be 0, making the expression evaluate to `ai`. Therefore, `year` is incremented by the value of `ai`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `year` is now equal to `ai`, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`.**
