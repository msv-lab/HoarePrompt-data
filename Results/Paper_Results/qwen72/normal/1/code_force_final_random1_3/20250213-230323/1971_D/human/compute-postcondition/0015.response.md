Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 0, `s` is a binary string of length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s` is updated to a new input binary string, `j` is 1, `len(s)` must be greater than 2, `count` is 3, if the first two characters of `s` are different, `flag` is True if `s[j-1]` is '0' and `s[j]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False.**
