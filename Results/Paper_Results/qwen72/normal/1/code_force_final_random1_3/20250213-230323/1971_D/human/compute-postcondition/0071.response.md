Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is 0, `count` is 2, and the first character of `s` is different from the second character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character of `s` is '1', `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
