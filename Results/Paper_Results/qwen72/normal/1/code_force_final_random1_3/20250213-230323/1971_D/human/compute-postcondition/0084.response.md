Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is 2, `count` is either 2, 3, or 4 depending on the first three characters of `s`. If `s[j]` is different from `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 3 or 4. If `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.***
