Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 1, `s` is a new input binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1', `j` is 0, `count` is 1, `flag` is False.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is updated to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, and `flag`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
