Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is 1.** 

Explanation: The code appends a new input string to the list `gr`, which initially contained one input string. After executing the code, `gr` now contains two input strings. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.
