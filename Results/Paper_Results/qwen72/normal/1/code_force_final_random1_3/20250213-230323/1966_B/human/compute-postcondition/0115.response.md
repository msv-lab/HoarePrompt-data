Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 2`, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). If `impossible` is `True`, then `ans` is 'NO' and for all `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.***
