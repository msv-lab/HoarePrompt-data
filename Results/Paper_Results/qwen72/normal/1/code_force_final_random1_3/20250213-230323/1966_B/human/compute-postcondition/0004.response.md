The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
