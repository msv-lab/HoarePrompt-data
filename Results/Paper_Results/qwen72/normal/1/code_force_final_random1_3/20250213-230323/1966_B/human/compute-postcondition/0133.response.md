Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 'YES' or 'NO'. For each test case, if `gr[0][0]` is different from `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` and all rows and columns have consistent colors except possibly the corners, `ans` is 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases remains unchanged.
- **`tc`**: After all iterations, `tc` will be `t - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t - 1`.
- **`n` and `m`**: These are the dimensions of the grid for the last test case.
- **`gr`**: This is the grid for the last test case, containing `n` strings each of length `m`.
- **`i`**: This is the index used to iterate through the rows of the grid, and it will be `n - 1` after the loop finishes processing the grid.
- **`ans`**: This variable holds the result of the test case. It will be 'YES' if the conditions for the grid are met, and 'NO' otherwise.
- **Conditions for `ans`**:
  - If the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) is different from the bottom-right corner (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), the program checks if all rows and columns have consistent colors except possibly the corners. If they do, `ans` is 'NO'; otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'.
  - If the top-left corner is the same as the bottom-right corner, `ans` remains 'YES'.
