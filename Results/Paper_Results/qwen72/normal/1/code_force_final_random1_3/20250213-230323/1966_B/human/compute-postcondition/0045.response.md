The only object in the loop head is the variable `tc`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `tc` relative to `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 0, and `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4. Since `tc` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the next iteration, `tc` will be 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is 'YES'. If `gr[0][0]` is different from `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO', and if `impossible` is `True`, the program maintains all these conditions. If `impossible` is `False`, the program also maintains all these conditions, but `impossible` is `False`, indicating that at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` has a different first character or a different last character. If `gr[0][0]` is the same as `gr[n-1][m-1]`, then the program maintains the original conditions with `ans` still being 'YES'.**
