Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`, `ans` is 'NO'. If `impossible` is `True`, then the program maintains all these conditions. If `impossible` is `False`, then the program also maintains all these conditions, but `impossible` is `False` indicating that at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` has a different first character or a different last character.***
