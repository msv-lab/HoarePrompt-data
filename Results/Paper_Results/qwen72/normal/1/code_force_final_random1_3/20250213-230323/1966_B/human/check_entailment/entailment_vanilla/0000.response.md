### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations.
   - An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - If the top-left corner (0, 0) and the bottom-right corner (n-1, m-1) are different colors, it might be impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the subrectangle operations can only affect squares of the same color.

3. **Checking Rows and Columns:**
   - The program checks if there are any adjacent squares in the first row or last row that are different colors. If all adjacent squares in these rows are the same color, it sets `impossible` to `False`.
   - Similarly, it checks if there are any adjacent squares in the first column or last column that are different colors. If all adjacent squares in these columns are the same color, it sets `impossible` to `False`.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - If `impossible` remains `True` after checking both rows and columns, it means there are no adjacent squares of different colors in the boundary, and thus it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - If `impossible` is `False`, it means there are adjacent squares of different colors, and it is possible to make the entire grid the same color.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the grid is already the same color by default setting `ans` to 'YES'.
   - It also handles the case where the grid is 1x1, which is always possible to make the same color.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. The checks for adjacent squares in the boundary rows and columns are sufficient to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
