To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `tc` is 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `m` is greater than 1.
- `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `j` is `m - 2`.
- The first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`).
- `impossible` is `True`.
- `ans` is 'NO'.
- For all `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`.

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```

For the loop to execute:
- `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `i` should start at 0 (the initial value of `i` is `n - 1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` must be greater than 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 0, `j` is `m - 2`, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO', for all `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`.**
