To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the loop head:

```python
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the variable `j` and the expression `m - 1`. For the loop to execute, `m - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, which means `m` must be greater than 1.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable is initialized by the loop itself and does not need to be adjusted.
2. **Variable `m`**: The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `tc` is 1 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head).
- `m` is an input integer (relevant to the loop head).
- `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings (not relevant to the loop head).
- `i` is `n-1` (not relevant to the loop head).
- `ans` is 'YES' (not relevant to the loop head).
- `impossible` is `True` (not relevant to the loop head).

The only variable in the loop head that affects the loop's execution is `m`. Therefore, `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `True`**
