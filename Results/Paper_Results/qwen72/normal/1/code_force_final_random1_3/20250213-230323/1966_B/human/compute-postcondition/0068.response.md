Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is `m - 1`. If any character at position `j` in the first string of `gr` is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the same string, or any character at position `j` in the last string of `gr` is different from the character at position `j + 1` in the same string, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `m - 1` times, so after all iterations, `j` will be `m - 1`.
- The loop checks if the characters at positions `j` and `j + 1` in the first and last strings of `gr` are different. If any such pair of characters is found, `impossible` is set to `False`.
- If no such pair is found throughout the loop, `impossible` remains `True`.
- All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
