Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is `m - 1`. If `gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.***
