The code snippet `gr.append(input())` appends a new input string to the list `gr`. The initial state specifies that `gr` is a list containing two input strings. After appending a new input string, `gr` will contain three input strings.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing three input strings, `i` is 2**
