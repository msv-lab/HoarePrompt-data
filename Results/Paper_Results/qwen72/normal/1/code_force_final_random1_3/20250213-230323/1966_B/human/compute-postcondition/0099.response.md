Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = 'YES'` reassigns the variable `ans` to the string 'YES'. Since `ans` was already 'YES' in the initial state, there is no change in the value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
