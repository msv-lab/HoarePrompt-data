Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`. If `impossible` is True, `ans` is set to 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES' and `impossible` remains False.***
