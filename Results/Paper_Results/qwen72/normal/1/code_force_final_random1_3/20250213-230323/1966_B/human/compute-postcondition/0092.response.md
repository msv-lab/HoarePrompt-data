To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `tc` is 2 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head).
- `gr` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop head).
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `ans` is 'YES' (not relevant to the loop head).
- `impossible` is `False` (not relevant to the loop head).

### Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is initialized to `n - 1` before the loop, but this value is not used in the loop head. The loop will use its own `i` starting from 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The initial value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`**
