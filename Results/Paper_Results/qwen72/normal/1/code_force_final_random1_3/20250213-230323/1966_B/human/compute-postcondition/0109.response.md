The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `gr` with its length `m`. The loop can execute if `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `j` is 2, and the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). If `gr[0][j]` is not equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` or `gr[n - 1][j]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**
