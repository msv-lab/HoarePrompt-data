To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive).
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which implies `n` must be greater than 1.
3. The variable `i` is automatically initialized to 0 by the `range` function when the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `tc` is 1 (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `i` is `n-1` (this needs to be adjusted).
- `j` is `m - 1` (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `impossible` is `True` (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `ans` is 'YES' (irrelevant to the loop execution).

Adjustments needed:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop, but this is handled by the `range` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 0 (automatically set by the loop), `j` is `m - 1`, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'YES'**
