Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing one input string, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`**. 

The code appends an input string to the list `gr`, which was initially empty. All other variables remain unchanged.
