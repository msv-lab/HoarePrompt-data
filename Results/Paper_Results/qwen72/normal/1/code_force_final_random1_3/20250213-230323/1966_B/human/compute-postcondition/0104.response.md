Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`, `j` is 0, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`). Additionally, either the first character of the first string in `gr` at index `j` is not equal to the next character at index `j + 1`, or the first character of the last string in `gr` at index `j` is not equal to the next character at index `j + 1`.**
