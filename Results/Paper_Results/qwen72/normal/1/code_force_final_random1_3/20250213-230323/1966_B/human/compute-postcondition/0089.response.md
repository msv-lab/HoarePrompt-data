The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `tc` relative to `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `tc` must be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, and if `impossible` is `True` (because at least one pair of consecutive strings in `gr` has different first or last characters), `ans` is set to 'NO'. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.**
