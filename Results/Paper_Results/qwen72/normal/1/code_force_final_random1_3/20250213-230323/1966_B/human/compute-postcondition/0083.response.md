Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `impossible` is `False` if any pair of consecutive strings in `gr` have different first or last characters; otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`, `ans` is 'YES'.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive). After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1`.
- The variable `j` remains unchanged as `m - 1` throughout the loop.
- The variable `impossible` is initially `True`. It becomes `False` if any pair of consecutive strings in `gr` (i.e., `gr[i]` and `gr[i + 1]`) have different first or last characters. If no such pair exists, `impossible` remains `True`.
- The variable `ans` remains 'YES' throughout the loop, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `t` and `tc` are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged.
