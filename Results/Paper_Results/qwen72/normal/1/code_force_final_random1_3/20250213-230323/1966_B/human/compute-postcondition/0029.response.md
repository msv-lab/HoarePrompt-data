To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```

This means the loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, or equivalently, if `n` is greater than 1. The variable `i` will start from 0 and iterate up to `n - 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (irrelevant for the loop execution)
- `tc` is 0 (irrelevant for the loop execution)
- `n` is an input integer (relevant for the loop execution)
- `m` must be greater than 1 (irrelevant for the loop execution)
- `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings (relevant for the loop execution)
- `i` is `n-1` (this needs to be adjusted to 0 for the loop to start correctly)
- The first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr` (irrelevant for the loop execution)
- `j` is `m-2` (irrelevant for the loop execution)
- `impossible` is `True` (irrelevant for the loop execution)
- `ans` is 'NO' (irrelevant for the loop execution)

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the following:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` must be 0 (since the loop will start with `i = 0`)

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is 0, the first character of the first string in `gr` is different from the last character of the last string in `gr`, `j` is `m-2`, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'NO'**
