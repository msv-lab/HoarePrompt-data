Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ans` is 'NO', for all `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`. If any `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]` for `i` from 0 to `n - 2`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` is `True`. If `impossible` is `True`, the program does not change any variables.***
