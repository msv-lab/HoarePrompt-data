Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `impossible` is `True`, `ans` is 'YES'**.

Explanation: The code sets the variable `impossible` to `True`. However, since the condition to change `ans` from 'YES' to 'NO' is not evaluated in the given code snippet, `ans` remains 'YES'. All other variables retain their initial values.
