Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, the first character of the first string in `gr` (`gr[0][0]`) is not equal to the last character of the last string in `gr` (`gr[n - 1][m - 1]`), `ans` is 'NO'. For all `j` from 0 to `m - 2`, `gr[0][j]` is equal to `gr[0][j + 1]` and `gr[n - 1][j]` is equal to `gr[n - 1][j + 1]`. If any `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]` for `i` from 0 to `n - 2`, then `impossible` is `False`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains `True`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive).
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 2`.
- The conditions on `t`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, and the characters in `gr` remain unchanged.
- The variable `impossible` will be `False` if any of the conditions inside the loop are met during any iteration. Otherwise, it remains `True`.
