The only objects in the loop head are the variable `tc` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, and `tc` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 0**
