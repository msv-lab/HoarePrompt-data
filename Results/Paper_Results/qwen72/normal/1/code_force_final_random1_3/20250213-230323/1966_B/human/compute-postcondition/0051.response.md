Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing two input strings, `i` is 1, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`**. 

The code appends a new input string to the list `gr`, which initially contained one input string. Therefore, `gr` now contains two input strings. All other variables remain unchanged.
