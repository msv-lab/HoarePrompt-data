Reasoning:

The program is designed to perform a balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. The key steps in the process are:

1. **Tracking Balance and Position**: The `func_2` function iterates through the input string `s`, maintaining a running balance of open and close parentheses. For each character, it creates a `BalanceInfo` object containing the current balance, the position of the character, and the character itself. This step ensures that we have a record of the balance and position for each character in the sequence.

2. **Sorting by Balance and Position**: The `func_2` function sorts the list of `BalanceInfo` objects. The sorting criteria are:
   - First, by the balance in ascending order.
   - Second, by the position in descending order when the balances are the same.

3. **Constructing the Result**: After sorting, the function constructs a new string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects. This new string is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

4. **Output**: The function prints the resulting shuffled string.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Balance Calculation**: The balance is correctly updated for each character in the input string. Opening parentheses increase the balance, while closing parentheses decrease it.
- **Sorting Criteria**: The sorting criteria match the problem's requirements. Balances are sorted in ascending order, and positions are sorted in descending order to break ties.
- **Result Construction**: The final string is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects, ensuring that the output is a valid balanced shuffle.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
