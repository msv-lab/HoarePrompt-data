Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is a `BalanceInfo` object representing the balance, index, and character at each position in `s`. The final `balance` will be 0 because `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.**

Explanation:
- The string `s` does not change during the loop execution.
- The variable `n` remains the length of `s`.
- The list `balance_info` will contain `n` elements, each corresponding to the balance, index, and character at each position in `s`.
- The `balance` variable starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 for each '(' and decremented by 1 for each ')'. Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the final `balance` will be 0 after processing all characters in `s`.
