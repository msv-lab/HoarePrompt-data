The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`. It returns the difference between the balances if they are different, resulting in a non-zero integer. If the balances are the same, it returns the difference between the positions of the characters, representing the distance between the positions of the characters in the input sequence that have the same balance.
