Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases for generating the lexicographically smallest word. Specifically, the logic for constructing the word is flawed in several ways:

1. **Case for `n > 52`**: The code assumes that if `n > 52`, the word should be constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This is incorrect because it does not account for all possible values of `n` and may produce invalid results. For example, if `n = 78`, the code will output `rzz`, which is correct, but for `n = 77`, it will output `qzz`, which is not the lexicographically smallest word. The correct word should be `pzz`.

2. **Case for `n > 26`**: The code assumes that if `n > 26`, the word should be constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This is also incorrect. For example, if `n = 55`, the code will output `czz`, which is correct, but for `n = 54`, it will output `bzz`, which is not the lexicographically smallest word. The correct word should be `azz`.

3. **Case for `n <= 26`**: The code assumes that if `n <= 26`, the word should be constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This is incorrect because it does not handle all possible values of `n` correctly. For example, if `n = 3`, the code will output `aaa`, which is correct, but for `n = 26`, it will output `aay`, which is not the lexicographically smallest word. The correct word should be `azz`.

To fix these issues, a more robust approach is needed to ensure that the lexicographically smallest word is generated for any valid `n` within the given range. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        
        # Determine the first character
        for j in range(26):
            if n - (j + 1) <= 26 * 2:
                word += alphabet[j]
                n -= (j + 1)
                break
        
        # Determine the second character
        for j in range(26):
            if n - (j + 1) <= 26:
                word += alphabet[j]
                n -= (j + 1)
                break
        
        # Determine the third character
        word += alphabet[n - 1]
        
        print(word)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is generated by iteratively determining the largest possible value for each character while ensuring the remaining sum is still valid.
