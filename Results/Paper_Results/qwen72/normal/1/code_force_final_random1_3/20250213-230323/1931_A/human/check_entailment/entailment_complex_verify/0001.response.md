### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word whose sum of the positions of its characters equals a given integer `n`.
   - The positions of the letters are from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The solution uses a series of conditions to determine the lexicographically smallest word:
     - If `n` is greater than 52, it means the first character must be at least 'r' (since 'r' is the 18th letter, and 18 + 26 + 26 = 70).
     - If `n` is between 27 and 52, it means the first character is 'a', and the second character must be at least 'b' (since 'a' + 'b' + 'z' = 2 + 26 + 26 = 54).
     - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, it means the first two characters are 'a', and the third character is determined by `n - 2`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: `n > 52`**
     - The code adds the character at position `n - 53` to the word, followed by 'zz'.
     - This is correct because the maximum value for the first character is 26, so `n - 53` ensures the first character is within the range.
   - **Case 2: `n > 26`**
     - The code adds 'a' as the first character, the character at position `n - 28` as the second character, and 'z' as the third character.
     - This is correct because the first character is fixed as 'a', and the remaining sum is distributed between the second and third characters.
   - **Case 3: `n <= 26`**
     - The code adds 'aa' as the first two characters and the character at position `n - 3` as the third character.
     - This is correct because the first two characters are fixed as 'a', and the remaining sum is used for the third character.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 3 (which results in 'aaa') and when `n` is 78 (which results in 'rzz').

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code confirms the logic described in the original assessment.
   - The state of the program before and after the function call is accurately described.
   - The conditions and the generation of the word are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly determines the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for the given sum `n` based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
