The code snippet `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` modifies the `word` variable by appending a character from the `alphabet` list (based on the index `n - 53`) followed by the string `'zz'`. Since `word` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `word` will contain the character from `alphabet` at the index `n - 53` followed by `'zz'`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.**
