To determine what will be printed by the `print(word)` statement, we need to evaluate the value of `word` based on the initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2 (though this is not used in determining `word`).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `word` is determined based on the value of `n`:
  - If `n` > 52, `word` is the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
  - If `n` ≤ 52 and `n` > 26, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
  - If `n` ≤ 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Case 1: `n` > 52**
   - `word` is the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
   - For example, if `n = 54`, then `word` would be `alphabet[1] + 'zz'`, which is `'bzz'`.

2. **Case 2: 26 < `n` ≤ 52**
   - `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - For example, if `n = 30`, then `word` would be `'a' + alphabet[2] + 'z'`, which is `'acz'`.

3. **Case 3: `n` ≤ 26**
   - `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - For example, if `n = 10`, then `word` would be `'aa' + alphabet[7]`, which is `'aah'`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact string that will be printed. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions:

- If `n` > 52, the output will be the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
- If 26 < `n` ≤ 52, the output will be `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- If `n` ≤ 26, the output will be `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Output: **word (where word is determined based on the value of n as described above)**
