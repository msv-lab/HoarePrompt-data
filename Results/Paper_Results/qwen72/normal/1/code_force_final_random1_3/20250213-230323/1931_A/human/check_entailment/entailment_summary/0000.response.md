Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`. The logic is divided into three cases based on the value of `n`:

1. **If `n` > 52**: 
   - The maximum possible sum for a three-letter word is 78 (i.e., 'zzz' = 26 + 26 + 26).
   - If `n` is greater than 52, the first letter must be at least the 27th letter of the alphabet (i.e., 'a' + 26 = 27), which is 'r'. The remaining sum is `n - 53`, and the smallest possible word is the character at position `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
   - Example: For `n = 70`, the word is 'rzz' because 70 - 53 = 17, and the 17th letter is 'r'.

2. **If `n` > 26 and `n` ≤ 52**:
   - The sum is between 27 and 52, inclusive. The smallest possible word starts with 'a' (1), and the second letter is the character at position `n - 28` (since 1 + 26 = 27).
   - Example: For `n = 55`, the word is 'czz' because 55 - 28 = 27, and the 27th letter is 'c'.

3. **If `n` ≤ 26**:
   - The sum is between 3 and 26, inclusive. The smallest possible word starts with 'aa' (2), and the third letter is the character at position `n - 3` (since 1 + 1 = 2).
   - Example: For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa' because 3 - 3 = 0, and the 0th letter is 'a'.

The program correctly handles these cases and generates the lexicographically smallest word for each `n` within the specified range. The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
