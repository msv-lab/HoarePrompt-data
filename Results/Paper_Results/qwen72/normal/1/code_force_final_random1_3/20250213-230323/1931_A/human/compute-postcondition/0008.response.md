Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.**

Explanation: The variable `word` is updated by concatenating the string 'a', the character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and the string 'z'. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The new value of `word` depends on the specific value of `n`, but it will always start with 'a', followed by a character from the alphabet, and end with 'z'.
