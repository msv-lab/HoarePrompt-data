Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is an empty string (`''`).**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `word` to an empty string (`''`). The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The conditions for determining the value of `word` based on `n` are not applied because `word` is explicitly set to an empty string. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `word` while keeping the other variables in their initial state.
