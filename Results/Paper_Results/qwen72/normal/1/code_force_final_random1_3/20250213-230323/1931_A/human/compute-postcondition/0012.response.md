Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `word` is determined as follows: If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at position `n - 53` in the `alphabet` list followed by `'zz'`. If `n` is between 1 and 52 inclusive, `word` is either 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z' if `n` > 26, or 'aa' + the character corresponding to the (n-3)th position in the alphabet if `n` â‰¤ 26.***
