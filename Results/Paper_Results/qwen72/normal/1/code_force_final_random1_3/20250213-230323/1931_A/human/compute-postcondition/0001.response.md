The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting point for the loop.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to 1**
