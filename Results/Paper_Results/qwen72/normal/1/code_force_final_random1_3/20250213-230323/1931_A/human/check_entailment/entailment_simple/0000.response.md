Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). The sum is calculated based on the position of each letter in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - It then constructs the lexicographically smallest word based on the value of `n`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **If `n > 52`**:
     - The maximum sum for a two-letter word is 52 (z + z = 26 + 26).
     - Therefore, if `n > 52`, the smallest possible word is formed by placing the largest possible letter at the first position and 'z' at the remaining two positions.
     - The first letter is `alphabet[n - 53]` because `n - 52` gives the position of the first letter.
   - **If `n > 26` and `n ≤ 52`**:
     - The maximum sum for a one-letter word is 26 (z).
     - Therefore, if `n > 26`, the smallest possible word is formed by placing 'a' at the first position, the largest possible letter at the second position, and 'z' at the third position.
     - The second letter is `alphabet[n - 28]` because `n - 27` gives the position of the second letter.
   - **If `n ≤ 26`**:
     - The smallest possible word is formed by placing 'a' at the first two positions and the largest possible letter at the third position.
     - The third letter is `alphabet[n - 3]` because `n - 2` gives the position of the third letter.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest.
   - The program prints the correct word for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
