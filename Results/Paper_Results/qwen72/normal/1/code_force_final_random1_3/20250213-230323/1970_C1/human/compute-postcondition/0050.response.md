Output State: **`tree[current]` must contain at least two neighbors, `neighbor` is the second neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to `visited`, and `queue` now contains a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` at the end. `neighbor` is now in `visited`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now includes this new tuple at its end. The conditions regarding `tree[current]` and `neighbor` being added to `visited` remain unchanged and are still valid.
