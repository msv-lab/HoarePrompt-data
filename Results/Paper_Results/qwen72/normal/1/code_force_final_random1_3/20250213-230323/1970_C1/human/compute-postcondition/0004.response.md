The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer conversions of these parts to the variables `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state where `x` must be greater than 1, the execution of the code does not affect the value of `x`. However, it introduces new variables `a` and `b` which are assigned the integer values from the input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from the input.**
