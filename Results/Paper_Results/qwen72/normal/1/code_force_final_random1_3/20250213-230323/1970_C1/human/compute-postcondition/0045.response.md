Output State: **`tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor in `tree[current]`, `neighbor` is now in `visited`.** 

Explanation: The code adds `neighbor` to the set `visited`, so `neighbor` is now part of the `visited` set. The other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged: `tree[current]` still contains at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is still the first neighbor in `tree[current]`.
