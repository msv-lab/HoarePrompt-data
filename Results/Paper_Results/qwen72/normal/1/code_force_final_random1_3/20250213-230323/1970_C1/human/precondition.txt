n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, representing the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, each defined by a pair of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and it is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The initial node for the game is given by an integer u_1 where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
