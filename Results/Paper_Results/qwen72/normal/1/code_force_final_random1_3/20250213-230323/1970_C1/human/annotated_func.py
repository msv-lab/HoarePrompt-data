#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it assumes the existence of a tree structure with specific properties (exactly two leaves) and a single round of the game (t=1). The tree is represented by a series of edges provided in the input, and the initial position of the stone is also given. The number of nodes `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and the edges connect nodes labeled from 1 to n. The initial node for the stone is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    lst = defaultdict(list)
    rev = defaultdict(list)
    for _ in range(x - 1):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        lst[a].append(b)
        
        rev[b].append(a)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, and `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times. The values of `a` and `b` will vary for each iteration based on the user input. The initial state of the tree and the initial position of the stone remain unchanged.
    z = int(input())
    tmp = z
    one = True
    while lst[tmp] != []:
        one = not one
        
        tmp = lst[tmp].pop()
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of the final non-empty list before it was popped, `one` alternates between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations (if the total number of iterations is odd, `one` is `False`; if even, `one` is `True`), and all lists in `lst` that were initially non-empty are now empty.
    two = True
    tmp = z
    while rev[tmp] != []:
        two = not two
        
        tmp = rev[tmp].pop()
        
    #State: `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-2)` times, `z` is an input integer and must be equal to `b`, `tmp` is now the last element of `rev[b]` that was not popped, `one` alternates between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations (if the total number of iterations is odd, `one` is `False`; if even, `one` is `True`), `two` is `True`, and all lists in `lst` that were initially non-empty are now empty.
    print('Hermione' if two and one else 'Ron')
    #This is printed: 'Hermione' if the number of iterations is even, otherwise 'Ron'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a tree structure with exactly two leaves, starting from an initial node specified by the user. It simulates a game where a stone moves through the tree's edges in two directions: forward and backward. The function determines the final position of the stone after one round of the game and prints 'Hermione' if the stone ends up in a position that corresponds to an even number of moves, and 'Ron' if the number of moves is odd. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
