The code snippet toggles the value of the variable `one`. Initially, `one` is `False`. After executing the code, `one` becomes `True`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `lst[z]` before it was popped, `one` is `True`, and `lst[z]` must not be an empty list but now has one less element.**
