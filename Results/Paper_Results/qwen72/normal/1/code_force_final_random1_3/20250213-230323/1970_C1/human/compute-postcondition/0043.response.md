The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the assumption that there is a tree structure with specific properties (exactly two leaves) and a single round of the game (t=1). The tree is represented by a series of edges, and the initial position of the stone is given. The number of nodes `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and the edges connect nodes labeled from 1 to n. The initial node for the stone is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.

The function returns the final position of the stone after one round of the game, considering the tree structure and the initial position of the stone.

Functionality: **The function operates on a predefined tree structure with exactly two leaves and an initial position of a stone. It returns the final position of the stone after one round of the game.**
