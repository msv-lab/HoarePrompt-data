Postcondition: ***`tree[current]` must contain at least three neighbors, and `neighbor` is the third neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to the set `visited`, and `queue` now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. Otherwise, `neighbor` remains unchanged and is not added to `visited` or `queue`.***
