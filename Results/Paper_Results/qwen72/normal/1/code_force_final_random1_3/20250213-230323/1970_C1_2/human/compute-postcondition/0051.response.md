Postcondition: ***`tree[current]` must contain at least two neighbors, and `neighbor` is the second neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is added to `visited`, and `queue` now contains a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` at the end. If `neighbor` is already in `visited`, no changes are made to `visited` or `queue`.***
