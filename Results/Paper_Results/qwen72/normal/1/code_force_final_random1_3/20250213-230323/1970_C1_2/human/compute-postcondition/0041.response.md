Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-2)` times, `z` is an input integer and must be equal to `b`, `tmp` is now the last element of `rev[b]` that was not popped, `one` alternates between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations (if the total number of iterations is odd, `one` is `False`; if even, `one` is `True`), `two` is `True`, and all lists in `lst` that were initially non-empty are now empty.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute until `rev[tmp]` is empty.
- Each iteration pops an element from `rev[tmp]` and updates `tmp` to this popped value.
- `two` toggles between `True` and `False` with each iteration.
- After all iterations, `tmp` will be the last element of `rev[b]` that was not popped, and `rev[tmp]` will be empty.
- The state of `one` depends on whether the total number of iterations is odd or even.
- All other conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.
