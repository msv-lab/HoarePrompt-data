The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `x`. The loop iterates `x - 1` times, so the loop can execute again if `x` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` must be greater than 1, and since the loop has already run once, `x` is effectively reduced by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be greater than 1.

However, the loop does not modify `x` or `_` directly within the loop head. The loop variable `_` is incremented implicitly by the loop mechanism, but it is not part of the condition that determines whether the loop continues.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for `x` (it must still be greater than 1), and no other variables in the loop head need adjustment.

State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element**
