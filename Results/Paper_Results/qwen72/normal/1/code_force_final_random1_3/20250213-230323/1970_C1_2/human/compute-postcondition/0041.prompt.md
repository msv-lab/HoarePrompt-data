Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is now equal to `z`, `one` alternates between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations (if the total number of iterations is odd, `one` is `False`; if even, `one` is `True`), `two` is `True`, and all lists in `lst` that were initially non-empty are now empty.
Code of the loop:
while rev[tmp] != []:
    two = not two
    tmp = rev[tmp].pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-2)` times, `z` is an input integer and must be equal to `b`, `tmp` is now equal to the last element of `rev[b]` before the pop operation, `one` alternates between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations (if the total number of iterations is odd, `one` is `False`; if even, `one` is `True`), `two` is `False`, and all lists in `lst` that were initially non-empty are now empty.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-2)` times, `z` is an input integer and must be equal to `b`, `tmp` is now equal to the last element of `rev[b]` before the pop operation, `one` alternates between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations, `two` is `True`, all lists in `lst` that were initially non-empty are now empty, and `rev[tmp]` must not be empty, `tmp` is now the second-to-last element of `rev[b]` (if it exists).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-2)` times, `z` is an input integer and must be equal to `b`, `tmp` is now the second-to-last element of `rev[b]` (if it exists), `one` alternates between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations, `two` is `False`, all lists in `lst` that were initially non-empty are now empty, and `rev[tmp]` must not be empty.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
