Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it assumes the existence of a tree structure with specific properties (exactly two leaves) and a single round of the game (t=1). The tree is represented by a series of edges provided in the input, and the initial position of the stone is also given. The number of nodes `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, and the edges connect nodes labeled from 1 to n. The initial node for the stone is an integer between 1 and n inclusive. `x` and `y` are integers representing the two nodes connected by an edge read from the input. `lst` is now a defaultdict with list as its default factory. `rev` is now a defaultdict with list as its default factory.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(x - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    lst[a].append(b)
    rev[b].append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` twice as additional elements, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element twice, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` three times as additional elements, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element three times, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
