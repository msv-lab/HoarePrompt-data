The code `lst[a].append(b)` adds the value of `b` to the list located at index `a` in `lst`. Given the initial state, `lst[a]` already contains `b` twice, and `rev[b]` contains `a` twice. After executing the code, `lst[a]` will contain `b` three times.

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` three times as additional elements, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element twice, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**
