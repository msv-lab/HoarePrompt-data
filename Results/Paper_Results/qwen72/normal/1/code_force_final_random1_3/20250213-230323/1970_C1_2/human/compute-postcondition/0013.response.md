Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` twice as additional elements, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element twice, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since the initial state already specifies that `a` and `b` are integers from user input, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new input values. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
