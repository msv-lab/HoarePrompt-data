To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while lst[tmp] != []:
```

This condition checks if the list `lst[tmp]` is not empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst[tmp]` must still contain at least one element.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` must be greater than 1
- `a` and `b` are integers from user input
- `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times
- `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times
- `z` is an input integer
- `tmp` is the last element of `lst[z]` before it was popped
- `one` is `False`
- `lst[z]` must not be an empty list but now has one less element

The key variable in the loop head is `lst[tmp]`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `lst[tmp]` must not be empty. Since `tmp` is the last element of `lst[z]` before it was popped, and `lst[z]` now has one less element, we need to ensure that `lst[tmp]` still contains at least one element.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state variables other than ensuring that `lst[tmp]` is not empty. Since the state already indicates that `lst[z]` is not empty but has one less element, and `tmp` is derived from `lst[z]`, we can assume that `lst[tmp]` still contains elements.

Thus, the state remains the same:
State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element `(x-1)` times, `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `lst[z]` before it was popped, `one` is `False`, and `lst[z]` must not be an empty list but now has one less element.**
