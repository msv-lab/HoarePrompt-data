The code `rev[b].append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `rev[b]`. This means that the list `rev[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements.

Given the initial state:
- `x` must be greater than 1
- `a` and `b` are integers from user input
- `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element

After executing the code, the updated state is:
- `x` must be greater than 1
- `a` and `b` are integers from user input
- `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element
- `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from user input, `lst[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element, `rev[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element.**
