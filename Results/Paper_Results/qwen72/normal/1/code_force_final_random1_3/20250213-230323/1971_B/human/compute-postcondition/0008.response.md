The code `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` sorts the characters in the string `s` and then joins them back into a single string, which is then assigned to the variable `b`.

- `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Sorting `s` will rearrange its characters in ascending order (alphabetical order).
- The sorted characters are then joined together to form a new string `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from `s`, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is a string formed by sorting the characters in `s` alphabetically.**
