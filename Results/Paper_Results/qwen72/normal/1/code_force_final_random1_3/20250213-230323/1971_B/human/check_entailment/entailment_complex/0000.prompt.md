Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the final `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters. Otherwise, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the final `s` alphabetically, `c` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the final `s` in reverse alphabetical order. If the final `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order, then `s` is equal to `b`. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters (up to 10 characters long). It checks if the string `s` contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints either the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order or in alphabetical order, depending on whether `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
