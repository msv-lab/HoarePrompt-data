You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the final `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters. Otherwise, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the final `s` alphabetically, `c` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the final `s` in reverse alphabetical order. If the final `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order, then `s` is equal to `b`. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters (up to 10 characters long). It checks if the string `s` contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints either the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order or in alphabetical order, depending on whether `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
2. **Set Creation**: For each test case, it creates a set `a` from the input string `s`. This is done to check the uniqueness of characters in the string.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the length of the set `a` is exactly 2. If it is, it prints "NO" because a string with exactly two unique characters cannot be rearranged to form a different string.
4. **Sorting and Reversing**: If the length of the set `a` is not 2, it proceeds to sort the string `s` in both ascending (`b`) and descending (`c`) order.
5. **Output Determination**:
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it prints the reversed string `c`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b`.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Case 1: String with all unique characters or more than two unique characters**:
  - The program correctly identifies that such strings can be rearranged to form a different string.
  - It sorts the string and checks if the sorted string is the same as the original string. If it is, it prints the reversed string; otherwise, it prints the sorted string.
  - This approach ensures that the output string is different from the original string.

- **Case 2: String with exactly two unique characters**:
  - The program correctly identifies that such strings cannot be rearranged to form a different string and prints "NO".

- **Case 3: String with one unique character**:
  - The program does not explicitly handle this case, but since the length of the set `a` would be 1, it will fall into the "else" block and print "YES". However, the sorted and reversed strings will be the same as the original string, which is incorrect.
  - **Correction Needed**: The program should check if the length of the set `a` is 1 and print "NO" in that case.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct but has a minor issue with handling strings that have only one unique character. To fix this, we need to add an additional check for the length of the set `a` being 1.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) <= 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the missing check for strings with one unique character)
