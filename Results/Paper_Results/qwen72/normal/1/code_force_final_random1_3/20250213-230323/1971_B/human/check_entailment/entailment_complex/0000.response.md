Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `n` and then iterating over each test case to read the string `s`.

2. **Unique Character Check**: The function uses a set to determine the number of unique characters in the string `s`. If the string has exactly two unique characters, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to rearrange the string to be different from the original.

3. **String Rearrangement**:
   - If the string has more than two unique characters, the function proceeds to sort the string in both ascending (`b`) and descending (`c`) order.
   - It then checks if the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`. If they are equal, it prints the reverse sorted string `c` to ensure the result is different from `s`.
   - If `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `b` because it is already different from `s`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string has only one unique character (e.g., "aaaaa"), which should always print 'NO'.
   - It also handles the case where the string has more than two unique characters and ensures the output is different from the original string.

5. **Output Format**: The function adheres to the required output format, printing 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the rearranged string when applicable.

However, there is a logical error in the condition `if len(a) == 2:`. This condition is too restrictive and will incorrectly print 'NO' for strings with exactly two unique characters, even if they can be rearranged to form a different string. For example, for the string "abab", the function will print 'NO', but a valid rearrangement like "baba" is possible.

To fix this, the condition should be changed to check if the string can be rearranged to be different from the original, regardless of the number of unique characters.

Corrected Condition:
```python
if len(a) == 1 or (len(a) == 2 and s == ''.join(sorted(s))):
    print('NO')
else:
    print('YES')
    b = ''.join(sorted(s))
    c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
    if b == s:
        print(c)
    else:
        print(b)
```

Given the current implementation, the function is incorrect due to the overly restrictive condition.

Correctness: **False**
