Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters. Otherwise, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is a string formed by sorting the characters in `s` alphabetically, `c` is a string formed by sorting the characters in `s` in reverse alphabetical order. If `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order, then `s` is equal to `b`. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters. Otherwise, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the new `s` alphabetically, `c` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the new `s` in reverse alphabetical order. If the new `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order, then `s` is equal to `b`. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters. Otherwise, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the new `s` alphabetically, `c` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the new `s` in reverse alphabetical order. If the new `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order, then `s` is equal to `b`. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
