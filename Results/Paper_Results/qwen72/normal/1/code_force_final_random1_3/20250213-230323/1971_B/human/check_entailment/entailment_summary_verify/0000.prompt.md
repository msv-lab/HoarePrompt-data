You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters (up to 10 characters long). It checks if the string `s` contains exactly two unique characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints either the string `s` sorted in reverse alphabetical order or in alphabetical order, depending on whether `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `if len(a) == 2:` is too restrictive. It incorrectly prints "NO" for strings with exactly two distinct characters, even when a valid rearrangement is possible. For example, for the input "abab", the program will print "NO" instead of "YES" and a valid rearrangement like "baba".

Additionally, the logic for generating the rearranged string is flawed. The program sorts the string and checks if the sorted version is equal to the original string. If it is, it prints the reverse sorted string. This approach fails in cases where the original string is already sorted but has more than two distinct characters. For example, for the input "abc", the program will print "cba" which is a valid rearrangement, but for "abcde", it will also print "edcba" which is not necessarily the only valid rearrangement.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that the generated string is different from the original string and that it handles all edge cases correctly.
