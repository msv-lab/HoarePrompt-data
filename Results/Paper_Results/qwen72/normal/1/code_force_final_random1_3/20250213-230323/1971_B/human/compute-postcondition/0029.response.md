Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from the new `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, the set `a` contains exactly 2 unique characters. Otherwise, the number of unique characters in `a` is not equal to 2, `b` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the new `s` alphabetically, `c` is a string formed by sorting the characters in the new `s` in reverse alphabetical order. If the new `s` is already sorted in alphabetical order, then `s` is equal to `b`. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.**
