Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The solution provided uses a specific formula to calculate this minimum number based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \).

1. **Special Case Handling**: The program checks if \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \). This special case corresponds to the scenario where all diagonals need to have at least one colored cell. In this case, the program prints \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is because, in a fully covered grid, the number of cells required is slightly more than half of \( k \) due to the overlapping nature of diagonals.

2. **General Case**: For other values of \( k \), the program prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This formula is derived from the observation that each colored cell can cover at most two diagonals. Therefore, to cover \( k \) diagonals, you need at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when \( k \) is very small (e.g., \( k = 1 \)) or very large (e.g., \( k = 4n - 2 \)).

4. **Input Validation**: The program assumes valid inputs as per the problem description, which is reasonable given the constraints.

5. **Output**: The output format matches the problem requirements, printing a single integer for each test case.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
