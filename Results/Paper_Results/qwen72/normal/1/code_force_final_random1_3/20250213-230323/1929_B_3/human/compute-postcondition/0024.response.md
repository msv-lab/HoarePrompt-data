Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers derived from the input file `s`.
- The value of `k` is determined based on the following conditions:
  - If `k` is less than or equal to 4 * n - 4, the value of `k` remains as it is.
  - If `k` is exactly 4 * n - 3, the value of `k` remains 4 * n - 3.
  - If `k` is 4 * n - 2, the value of `k` remains 4 * n - 2.
  - If `k` is greater than 4 * n - 4 and not equal to 4 * n - 3 or 4 * n - 2, the value of `k` remains unchanged, which could be any value greater than 4 * n - 4.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet only involves the variable `n` and does not depend on `k` or `t`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2 * n - 1)
```

This statement calculates the value of `2 * n - 1` and prints it. Since `n` is an integer derived from the input file `s`, the exact value of `n` is not specified, but the expression `2 * n - 1` will always be an integer.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the value of `2 * n - 1`.

Output: **2 * n - 1 (where n is an integer derived from the input file s)**
