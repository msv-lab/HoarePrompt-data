The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This operation updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the new input, replacing their previous values.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- The condition \(4 \times n - 2\) equals `k` or does not equal `k` based on the initial values of `n` and `k`

After executing the code:
```
n, k = map(int, input().split())
```

The output state is:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration
- `n` is now the first integer from the new input
- `k` is now the second integer from the new input
- The condition \(4 \times n - 2\) equals `k` or does not equal `k` based on the new values of `n` and `k`

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, and the condition \(4 \times n - 2\) equals `k` or does not equal `k` based on the new values of `n` and `k`.**
