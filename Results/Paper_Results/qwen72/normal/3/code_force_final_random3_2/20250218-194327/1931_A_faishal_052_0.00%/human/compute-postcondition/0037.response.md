The `arr.sort()` method will sort the list `arr` in ascending order. The list `arr` contains three elements: the first two elements are either 1 or 26, and the third element is `lex`. The value of `lex` has been updated based on the given conditions. Let's consider the possible values of `lex` after the update:

- If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, it is now `lex - 2`.
- If `lex` was initially between 26 and 51, it is now between 0 and 25.
- If `lex` was initially between 52 and 100, it is now between 26 and 74.

Given these conditions, the sorted list `arr` will be:

- If `lex` is now between 0 and 25, the sorted list will be `[1, 26, lex]` or `[26, 1, lex]`.
- If `lex` is now between 26 and 74, the sorted list will be `[1, 26, lex]` or `[26, 1, lex]` or `[1, lex, 26]` or `[26, lex, 1]`.

Since `1` and `26` are the only fixed values, and `lex` can fall into the specified ranges, the list will be sorted accordingly. The variables `cases`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being `lex` (where `lex` is between 0 and 25 if it was between 26 and 51 initially, or between 26 and 74 if it was between 52 and 100 initially, or `lex - 2` if it was less than or equal to 26 initially), `j` is 2.**
