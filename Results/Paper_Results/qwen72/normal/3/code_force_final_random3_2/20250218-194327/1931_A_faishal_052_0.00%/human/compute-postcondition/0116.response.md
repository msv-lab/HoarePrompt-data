Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list that contains `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 25 and 50. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and greater than 26, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between -26 and -1. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between -1 and 24. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 25 and 51.**
