The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and the range `3`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute 3 times regardless of the values of `cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `j`, because the range is fixed at 3. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. However, we can specify the initial state of `k` for clarity.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being `lex` (where `lex` is between 0 and 25 if it was between 26 and 51 initially, or between 26 and 74 if it was between 52 and 100 initially, or `lex - 2` if it was less than or equal to 26 initially), `j` is 2, `k` is 0**
