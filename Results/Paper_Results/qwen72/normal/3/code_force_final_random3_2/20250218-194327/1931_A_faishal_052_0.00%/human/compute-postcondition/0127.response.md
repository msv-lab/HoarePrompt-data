Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `arr` is a sorted list that contains:
     - `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26.
     - `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51.
     - `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52.
   - `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, depending on its initial value.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement uses the `chr` function to convert a number to its corresponding character in the ASCII table.
   - `arr[k]` is the element at index `k` of the list `arr`.
   - `k` is 0, so `arr[k]` is the first element of `arr`.
   - The first element of `arr` is always 1, regardless of the value of `lex`.

4. **ASCII Conversion:**
   - `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which corresponds to the character 'a'.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the character 'a' without a newline at the end.

Output: **a**
