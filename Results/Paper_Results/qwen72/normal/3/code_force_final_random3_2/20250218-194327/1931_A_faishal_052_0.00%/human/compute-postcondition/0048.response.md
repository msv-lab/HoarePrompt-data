The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range parameter `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range parameter. The range function `range(2)` will always produce a sequence from 0 to 1, which means the loop will always execute at least once, regardless of the initial value of `j`.

However, the initial value of `j` is 2, which is not relevant to the loop execution because `j` will be reassigned by the loop. The loop will start with `j` being 0 for the first iteration and 1 for the second iteration.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute, but we can clarify the state of `j` at the start of the loop:

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer**
