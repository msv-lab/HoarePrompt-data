Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing `[26]`, `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26, `j` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` is now greater than or equal to 26.
- The values of `cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `j` remain unchanged.
