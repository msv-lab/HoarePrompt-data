To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 4.
   - `arr` is a sorted list based on the conditions provided for `lex`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement uses the `chr` function to convert a value to its corresponding character.
   - The value being converted is `arr[k] + 96`.
   - `k` is 4, so we need to know the value of `arr[4]`.
   - `arr` is a sorted list, but the exact values of the elements in `arr` are not provided. However, since `arr` is sorted, we can infer that `arr[4]` is the 5th smallest element in the list (indexing starts at 0).

4. **Character Conversion:**
   - The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - Adding 96 to an integer and then converting it to a character will map the integer to a lowercase letter. For example:
     - `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is `'a'`.
     - `chr(2 + 96)` is `chr(98)`, which is `'b'`.
     - `chr(3 + 96)` is `chr(99)`, which is `'c'`.
     - And so on.

5. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since `arr` is sorted, `arr[4]` will be the 5th smallest element in the list.
   - Let's assume `arr[4]` is some integer `n`.
   - The character printed will be `chr(n + 96)`, which will be the lowercase letter corresponding to the integer `n`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - Without the exact values of `arr`, we can't determine the exact character. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **the lowercase letter corresponding to the 5th smallest element in the sorted list `arr` (where `arr[4]` is the 5th smallest element in the list and `chr(arr[4] + 96)` converts this element to a lowercase letter)**
