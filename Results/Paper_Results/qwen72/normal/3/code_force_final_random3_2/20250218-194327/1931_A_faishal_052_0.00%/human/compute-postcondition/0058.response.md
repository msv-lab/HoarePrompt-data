Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the element 26, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` is now greater than or equal to 26. The other variables remain unchanged.
