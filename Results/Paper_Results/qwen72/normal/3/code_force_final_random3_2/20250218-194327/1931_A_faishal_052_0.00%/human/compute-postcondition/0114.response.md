The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `range(2)`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the range specified in `range(2)`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. However, since the loop condition is `j` being less than 2, the loop will not execute again once `j` is 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which will be the last iteration of the loop) should be:
State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains `[1, 1]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between 1 and 24. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 26 and 50. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 27. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains `[1, 26]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 25 and `lex` is now an integer between -25 and 0. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 25. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 26.**
