The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `cases` must still be greater than `i`, which means `cases` must be greater than 2.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list based on the conditions provided for `lex`.**
