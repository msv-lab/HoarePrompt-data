Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains `[1, 26]` and `lex` is an integer between -25 and 0. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` contains `[26, 26]` and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 25. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26]` and `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` is greater than 51, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`, and `arr` contains `[1, 26]` if `lex` is less than or equal to -1, `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 0 and 25, or `[26, 26]` if `lex` is greater than or equal to 26.***
