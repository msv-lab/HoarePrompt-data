Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `j` is 2, `k` is 3**. 

The initial state specified that `arr` was sorted in ascending order with specific conditions for its elements. However, the code snippet `arr = []` reassigns `arr` to an empty list, overriding its previous values. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.
