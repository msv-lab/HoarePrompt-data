Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list based on the conditions provided for `lex`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates 3 times, as specified by `range(3)`.
- The loop variable `k` is used as an index to access elements in the list `arr` and print them as characters.
- The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` (the loop index) is reset to 3 after the loop completes, as it is defined in the initial state and not modified by the loop.
- The list `arr` remains the same throughout the loop, as it is not modified within the loop body.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the state of the variables is the same as the initial state, with the exception that the loop index `k` is reset to its initial value of 3.
