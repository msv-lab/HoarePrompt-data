Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, `lex` is an input integer, and `j` is 0. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is decreased by 1 and is now less than or equal to 25. If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `lex` remains greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` is between 1 and 25, `lex` is updated to a value between 1 and 25.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional element (1 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise 26), `lex` is an input integer, and `j` is 1. If `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `lex` is now less than or equal to 25. If `lex` was between 26 and 51, `lex` is updated to a value between 0 and 25. If `lex` was between 52 and 100, `lex` remains an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional element (1 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise 26). `lex` is updated as follows: if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, it is now less than or equal to 25; if `lex` was between 26 and 51, it is updated to a value between 0 and 25; if `lex` was between 52 and 100, it is updated to `lex - 26` and is now between 26 and 74. `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
