The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the end of the list `arr`. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. The value of `lex` and the conditions it satisfies also remain unchanged. The list `arr` will now have an additional element `1` appended to it, regardless of its initial state.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1, 1]` or `[1, 26, 1]`. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1, 1]` or `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1, 1]` or `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 25.**
