Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `cases - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being the remaining value of `lex` after the loop's operations, `j` is 2, `k` is 3.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `cases` remains an integer between 1 and 100, as it was in the initial state.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `cases - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The list `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains three elements. The first two elements are either 1 or 26, depending on the initial value of `lex` for each iteration. The third element is the remaining value of `lex` after the loop's operations, which will be between 0 and 25 if `lex` was initially between 26 and 51, or between 26 and 74 if `lex` was initially between 52 and 100, or `lex - 2` if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26.
- The loop variables `j` and `k` are both set to 2 and 3, respectively, as they are reset for each iteration of the outer loop.
