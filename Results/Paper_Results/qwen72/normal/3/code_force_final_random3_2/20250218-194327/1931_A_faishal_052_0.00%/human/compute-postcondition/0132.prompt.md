Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list that now contains `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, depending on its initial value.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(3):
    print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list that now contains `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, depending on its initial value

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list that now contains `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, depending on its initial value

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list that now contains `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, depending on its initial value




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
