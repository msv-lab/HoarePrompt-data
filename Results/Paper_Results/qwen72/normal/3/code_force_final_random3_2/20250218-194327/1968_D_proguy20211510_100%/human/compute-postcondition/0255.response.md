Output State: **`i` is 2, `pathb` is a list with at least 3 elements, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[1]`, `resb` is the maximum of the original `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, and `resb` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`. If `k` is less than 3, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 2.
- `pathb` is still a list with at least 3 elements.
- `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`.
- `preb` remains `preb + pathb[1]`.
- `resb` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`.
- If `k` is less than 3, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
