Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb` remain unchanged; `paths` is a list that now includes the elements `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, appended to its end until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1; `ps` is now the value of the last index in the sequence `p[ps - 1]`, `p[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, that was visited (i.e., `vis[ps - 1]` is 1); `resb` is 0; `ress` is 0; `preb` is 0; `pres` is 0.**
