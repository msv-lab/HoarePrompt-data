Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the following changes have been made:**

- `i` is equal to the length of `pathb` minus 1, as the loop iterates over the entire length of `pathb`.
- `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, because in each iteration, `preb` is incremented by the current element of `pathb`.
- `curr` is the final value calculated as `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, where `i` is the last index of `pathb` that was processed.
- `resb` is the maximum value of all `curr` values calculated during the loop, which represents the highest value obtained from the formula `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` over all iterations where `k >= i + 1`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `ress`, `pres`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
