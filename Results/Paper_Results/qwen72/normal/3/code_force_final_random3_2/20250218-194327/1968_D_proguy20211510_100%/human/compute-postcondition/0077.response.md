Output State: **`paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `paths`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, and `ress` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
