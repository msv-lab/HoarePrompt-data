The function `func` processes multiple game scenarios defined by user inputs. Each scenario involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who move through a permutation of integers `p` and collect scores from an array `a` over a specified duration `k`. The function determines the winner based on the maximum score each player can achieve within the game duration, starting from their respective positions `P_B` and `P_S`. If Bodya's maximum score is greater than Sasha's, the function outputs 'Bodya'. If Sasha's maximum score is greater, it outputs 'Sasha'. If both have the same maximum score, it outputs 'Draw'. The function does not return any values but prints the result for each test case.
