Output State: **`pathb` must have at least one element. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[i]`.** 

In natural language: The initial condition that `pathb` must have at least one element remains valid. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program will still break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `curr` remains the same as before, which is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. The value of `preb` is now updated to `preb + pathb[i]`.
