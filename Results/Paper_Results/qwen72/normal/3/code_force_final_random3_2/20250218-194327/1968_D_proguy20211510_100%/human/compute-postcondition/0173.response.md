Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `curr`, `paths`, and `ps` remain unchanged; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1; `pres` is now `pres + paths[i - 1]; `curr` is now `pres + paths[i - 1] * (k - (i - 1))`. `ress` is now the maximum of `ress` and `curr` from the previous iteration. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
