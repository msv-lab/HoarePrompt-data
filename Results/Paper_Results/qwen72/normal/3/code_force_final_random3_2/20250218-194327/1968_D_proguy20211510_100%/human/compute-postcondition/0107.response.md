Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `i` is equal to the length of `paths` or `k`, whichever is smaller, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `curr` is the value of `pres + paths[i-1] * (k - (i-1))` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged, `ress` is the maximum value encountered during the loop, which is the maximum of the initial `ress` and all values of `curr` computed in each iteration, and if `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to `resb`. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, except `vis[pb - 1]` which is now 1.**
