Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `pres`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `ress`, `paths`, `ps`, `pathb` remain unchanged, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `len(pathb)` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `k` < `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The value of `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. The value of `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i]`. The value of `resb` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `curr`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The condition `len(pathb) > i + 1` must still hold true. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
