The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by a set of parameters: `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the permutation.
  - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the duration of the game.
  - `P_B` and `P_S` are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
  - `p` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, representing the permutation.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array of scores.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the result of the game for each test case. The exact nature of the result is not specified in the constraints, but it is likely to be a value or a list of values that indicate the outcome of the game based on the given parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the duration of the game `k`, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha `P_B` and `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array of scores `a`. For each test case, it returns the result of the game based on these parameters.**
