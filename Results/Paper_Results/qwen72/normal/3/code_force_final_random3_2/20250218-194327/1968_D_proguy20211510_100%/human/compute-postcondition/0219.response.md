Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged except that `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `vis[ps - 1] = 1` sets the element at the index `ps - 1` in the list `vis` to 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `ps`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`) remain unchanged.
- The list `vis` is still of length `n` with all elements initially set to 0, except for the element at index `ps - 1`, which is now 1.
