Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` are integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb` remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `paths`, `preb`, `resb`) are not affected by this code.
