Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the final value after all iterations, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`, `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from the sequence `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on, until the loop condition is met, `paths` is a list containing the integers `a[ps - 1]` and the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`, except `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state information that `ps` was `p[ps - 1]` is still valid, but now `ps` has been updated to the next value in the sequence defined by `p`.
- The list `vis` still has a 1 at the index `ps - 1`, but `ps` has been updated, so the index where `vis` is 1 might change in subsequent iterations.
