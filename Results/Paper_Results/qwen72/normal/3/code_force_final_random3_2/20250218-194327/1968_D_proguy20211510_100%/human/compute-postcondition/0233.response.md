Output State: **`n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged except that `paths` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end. `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`. If `vis[ps - 1]` was already 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.** 

In natural language: The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged. The list `paths` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at its end. The variable `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. If the element at index `ps - 1` in the list `vis` was already 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
