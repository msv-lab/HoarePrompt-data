Output State: **`n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `preb`, `resb`, and `vis` remain unchanged except that `vis[ps - 1]` is now 1, and `paths` now includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end. `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to be the value at the index `ps - 1` in the list `p`. All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
