Output State: **`paths` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, and if `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues with `i` remaining 0 and `paths` unchanged.**
