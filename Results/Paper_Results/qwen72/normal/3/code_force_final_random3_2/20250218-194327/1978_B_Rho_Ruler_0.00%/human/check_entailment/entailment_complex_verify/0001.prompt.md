You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k, a, b, and n are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9 and 0 <= k <= min(n, b).
def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`, all of which are non-negative integers within the constraints 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9 and 0 <= k <= min(n, b). It calculates a value `ans` which is the sum of `k * b` and `(n - k) * a`. The function then returns a boolean value indicating whether `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. Given the constraints and the calculation, the function will always return `True`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Bob can sell `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - The program uses a binary search to determine the optimal value of `k`.
   - The binary search is performed on the range `[0, n]`.
   - The function `func_1` is used to check if a given `k` is valid.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the total profit if `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price.
   - It sums the profit from the first `k` buns: `k * b - k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - It adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: `(n - k) * a`.
   - It returns `True` if the total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, otherwise `False`.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search updates `low` and `high` based on the result of `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it means the current `k` is valid, and we try to increase `k` by setting `low = mid + 1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it means the current `k` is too large, and we try to decrease `k` by setting `high = mid - 1`.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum valid `k` found by the binary search.

6. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented. It should calculate the total profit and compare it to the maximum possible profit, but the current implementation is incorrect.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns should be calculated as the sum of the series `(b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1))`, which is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
   - The function should return `True` if the total profit is greater than or equal to the profit obtained by selling all buns at the usual price, not less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation of `func_1` should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(k, a, b, n):
         profit_modified = k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2
         profit_usual = (n - k) * a
         total_profit = profit_modified + profit_usual
         return total_profit >= n * a
     ```

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect, which will lead to incorrect results in the binary search.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
