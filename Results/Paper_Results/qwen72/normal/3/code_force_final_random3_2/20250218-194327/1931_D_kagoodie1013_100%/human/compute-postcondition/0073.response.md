Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains four elements: an integer `n`, integers `x` and `y`, and a list of integers `arr` of length `n`. It processes each tuple to count the number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once, where `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`. The function returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the count of such pairs for each tuple in `test_cases`. After the function concludes, `test_cases` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the final counts for each tuple. **
