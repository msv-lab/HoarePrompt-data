Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `residue_map`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `count`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
