Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` now contains the key `current_key` with the value `1`, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.**
