Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`**. 

This means:
- `arr` remains unchanged and still contains at least one element.
- `num` is still the first element of `arr`.
- `r_x` is now assigned the value of the expression `-num % x`, which calculates the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`.
