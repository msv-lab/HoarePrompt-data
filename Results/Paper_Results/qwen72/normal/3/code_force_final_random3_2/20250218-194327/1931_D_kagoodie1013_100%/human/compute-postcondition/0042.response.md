Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1, `count` is incremented by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map` or by 0 if the key is not found.**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains a list with at least 3 elements.
- `num` remains the third element of `arr`.
- `r_x` remains the result of `-num % x`.
- `r_y` remains the result of `num % y`.
- `current_key` remains a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`.
- `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1, so the value associated with `current_key` in `residue_map` is now one more than it was before.
- `count` is incremented by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map` or by 0 if the key `(r_x, r_y)` is not found in `residue_map`.
