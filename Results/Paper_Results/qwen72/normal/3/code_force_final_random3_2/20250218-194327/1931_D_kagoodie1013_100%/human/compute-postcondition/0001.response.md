To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` contains at least one tuple. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`test_cases`**: This must be a list of tuples, and for the loop to execute, it must contain at least one tuple.
2. **`n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`**: These are the elements of the tuple that will be unpacked in each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, the first tuple in `test_cases` will be unpacked into these variables.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples.
- `results` is an empty list.

We need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one tuple, and the first tuple is unpacked into `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple, and `results` is an empty list**.
