Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `r_x = -num % x` calculates the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`.
- `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `count`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged.
- `r_x` is now set to the result of `-num % x`.
