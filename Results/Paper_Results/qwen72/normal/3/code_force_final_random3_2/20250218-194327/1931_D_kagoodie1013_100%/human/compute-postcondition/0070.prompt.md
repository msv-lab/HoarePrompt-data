Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `x`, and `y`, such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`, such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    residue_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        r_x = -num % x
        r_y = num % y
        count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
        current_key = num % x, num % y
        residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and has `len(arr)` elements, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `count`, `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have been encountered more than once, `residue_map` contains keys that are tuples of the form `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and the value for each key is the number of times that pair has been encountered, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` remains a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and the value is the count of how many times that tuple has been encountered, `count` is the total number of times a key `(r_x, r_y)` has been found in `residue_map` before the current iteration, `results` is a list that now includes `count` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` remains a list with `len(arr)` elements, `num` is the last element of `arr` processed by the loop, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element, `r_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element, `count` is the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that have appeared before the current element in the loop, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)` and the value is the count of how many times this tuple has appeared in the loop, `results` is a list that now includes `count` as its last element and has one more element than before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
