The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute one more time for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` is the second element of `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` will be the third element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 1, `residue_map` now contains the key `current_key` with the value `2`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.**
