Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over this list to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case, including `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`. This approach is efficient and correctly handles the input format.

2. **Test Case Storage**: The program stores the test cases in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. This is a good way to organize the data for processing.

3. **Residue Calculation**: For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs. It also initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to store the counts of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` where `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x` and `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.

4. **Pair Counting**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - It then checks if the current pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` already exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `count`.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current pair of residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

5. **Output**: The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them, each on a new line.

6. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the residues is correct. The pair `(r_x, r_y)` is used to determine if a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful.
   - However, there is a subtle issue with the way the residues are calculated and used. Specifically, the program uses `-num % x` for `r_x` and `num % y` for `r_y`. This is intended to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

7. **Residue Calculation Issue**:
   - The calculation of `r_x` as `-num % x` is correct for checking the sum condition because `-num % x` gives the residue of `-num` modulo `x`, which is equivalent to checking if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - However, the calculation of `r_y` as `num % y` is not correct for checking the difference condition. The difference condition requires checking if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`. This means that for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, the residues of `a_i` and `a_j` modulo `y` should be the same. Therefore, `r_y` should be calculated as `num % y` for both `a_i` and `a_j`.

8. **Fixing the Issue**:
   - The correct way to check the difference condition is to use the same residue for both `a_i` and `a_j`. This means that the key in `residue_map` should be `(num % x, num % y)` for both the sum and difference conditions.
   - The current implementation correctly updates the `residue_map` with `(num % x, num % y)`, but it incorrectly uses `-num % x` for `r_x` when checking the count.

9. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 2, which is the minimum allowed value.
   - It also handles the case where the array elements are all the same, as the residues will be the same, and the program will correctly count the pairs.

10. **Efficiency**:
    - The program processes each test case in \(O(n)\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program has a logical issue in the way it checks the difference condition. The use of `-num % x` for `r_x` is correct, but the use of `num % y` for `r_y` is not sufficient to ensure that the difference condition is met. The program should use the same residue for both conditions, which it does not.

Final: **False**
