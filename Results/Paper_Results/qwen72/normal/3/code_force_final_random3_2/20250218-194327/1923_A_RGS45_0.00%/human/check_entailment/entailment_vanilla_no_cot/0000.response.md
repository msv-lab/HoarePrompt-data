Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string `arr` representing the ribbon.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) in the ribbon.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip (1) in the ribbon by reversing the string and finding the first chip.

3. **Extracting the Substring:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This effectively removes any leading or trailing free cells (0s).

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (0s) within the extracted substring. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when all chips are already in a single block or when there are no free cells between the chips. Therefore, the program is correct.
