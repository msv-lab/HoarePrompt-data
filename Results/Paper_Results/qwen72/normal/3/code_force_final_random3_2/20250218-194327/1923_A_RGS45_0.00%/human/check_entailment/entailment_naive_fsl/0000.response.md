Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple chips with free cells between them. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 0 1 0 1
```

The expected output is `2`, but the program will output `1`. This is because the program incorrectly counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, without considering the need to move chips to form a single block. The logic to move chips to the closest free cell to the left and then count the number of operations required to form a single block is missing.
