Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated to the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The substring is determined based on the values of `x` and `y` as defined in the initial state. If `x` or `y` are -1 (indicating '1' is not found), the substring `z` will be an empty string or may result in an error if `n - y - 1` is out of bounds. However, since the initial state specifies the conditions for `x` and `y`, we assume they are valid indices.
