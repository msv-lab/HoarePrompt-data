Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input(''))` updates the value of `n` to an input integer. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` while keeping the initial state of the other variables intact.
