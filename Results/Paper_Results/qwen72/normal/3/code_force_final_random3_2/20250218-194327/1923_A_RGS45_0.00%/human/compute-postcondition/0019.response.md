Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`. If '1' is not found in the reversed `arr`, `y` is set to -1.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The value of `z` is still defined as the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` to index `n - y - 1` (inclusive), but `y` has been updated, so the actual value of `z` may change depending on the new value of `y`.
