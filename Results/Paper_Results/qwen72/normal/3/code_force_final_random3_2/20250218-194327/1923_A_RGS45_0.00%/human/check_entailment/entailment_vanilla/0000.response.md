### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the ribbon configuration `arr` as a string of '0's and '1's.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (from the left).
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the first chip from the right, which is equivalent to the index of the last chip from the left.

3. **Extracting the Subarray:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the subarray from the first chip to the last chip. This subarray will contain all the chips and any free cells between them.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells ('0's) in the subarray `z`. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

### Analysis:
- The approach correctly identifies the subarray that contains all the chips and any free cells between them.
- The number of free cells in this subarray is indeed the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Chip:** If there is only one chip, the subarray will contain no free cells, and the function will correctly output `0`.
- **No Free Cells Between Chips:** If there are no free cells between the chips, the subarray will contain no '0's, and the function will correctly output `0`.
- **Multiple Test Cases:** The function handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over the range `t`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
