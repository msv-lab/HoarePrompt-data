Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp`, and `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`inp`**: Remains unchanged as it is only iterated over and not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: After the loop completes, `x` will be the smallest integer in the list `inp`. This is because the loop continuously updates `x` to be the smallest value encountered.
- **`y`**: After the loop completes, `y` will be the second smallest integer in the list `inp`. This is because `y` is updated only when the current element `a` is greater than `x` but less than or equal to `y`.
- **`ans`**: `ans` counts the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`. This is because the loop increments `ans` whenever it encounters an element `a` that is greater than both `x` and `y`.
