The code snippet `x == y` is a comparison that checks if `x` is equal to `y`. This comparison does not change the values of `x` or `y`, nor does it introduce any new variables. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `inp`, `a` is greater than `x`, and `a` is greater than `y`**
