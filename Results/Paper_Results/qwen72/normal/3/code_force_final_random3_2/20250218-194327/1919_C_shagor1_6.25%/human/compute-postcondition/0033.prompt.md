Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is a temporary variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is a temporary variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `a` is less than or equal to `x` (which is `n + 1`), `y` remains `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `x` (which is `n + 1`), `y` is set to `a` and `x == y` evaluates to `False` if `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is a temporary variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `ans` is 0 if the first element of `inp` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1 or 2. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains `n + 1` or is set to the first element of `inp` if the first element is greater than `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `x`, `ans` is 1 if the first element of `inp` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 2, and `y` is set to `a`. In all cases, `x` and `y` are updated according to the conditions, and `x == y` evaluates to `False` if `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is a temporary variable, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, and `ans` is 0 if the first element of `inp` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains `n + 1` or is set to the first element of `inp` if the first element is greater than `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `x`, `ans` is 1 if the first element of `inp` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 2 or 3. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `y` is set to `a` and `x` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than `y`, `y` is set to `a`. In all cases, `x` and `y` are updated according to the conditions, and `x == y` evaluates to `False` if `ans` is 1 or 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
