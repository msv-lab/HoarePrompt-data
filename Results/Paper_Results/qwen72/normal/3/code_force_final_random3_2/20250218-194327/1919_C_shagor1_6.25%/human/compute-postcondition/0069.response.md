Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`.
   - `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp`.
   - `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `ans` is determined by counting the number of elements in the list `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.
   - `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, and `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp`.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest integers in `inp`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest integers in `inp`)**
