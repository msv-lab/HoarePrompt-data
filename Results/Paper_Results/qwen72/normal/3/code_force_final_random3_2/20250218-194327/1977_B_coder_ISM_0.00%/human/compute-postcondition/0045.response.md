Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `range(0, 29)` is a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is '1' if the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1, and '0' if the corresponding bit in `x` is 0. If `flag` is 1, `s[1]` is '0'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '1' and `s[1]` is equal to `s[2]`, then `flag` is set to 1 and the first element of `s` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 and the first element of `s` is either not '1' or not equal to `s[2]`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[1]` is '0', `flag` remains 1 and the first element of `s` is either not '1' or not equal to `s[2]`.**
