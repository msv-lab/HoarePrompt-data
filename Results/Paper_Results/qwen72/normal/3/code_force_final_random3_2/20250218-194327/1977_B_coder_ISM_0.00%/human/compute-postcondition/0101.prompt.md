Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 28, `range(0, 29)` remains a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, `s` is an empty list, `nalla` is 29, `t` must be greater than 29, `x` is an input integer, `length` is 30.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `range(30)` remains a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. If the bit at position 0 of `x` is set (i.e., `x` is an odd number), `s` now contains the string `'1'` as its last element. Otherwise, `s` now contains the string `'0'` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `range(30)` remains a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. If the bit at position 1 of `x` is set (i.e., `x` is an odd number when considering the bit at position 1), `s` now contains the string `'1'` as its last element. Otherwise, `s` now contains the string `'0'` as its last element. Additionally, if the bit at position 0 of `x` was set (i.e., `x` is an odd number), `s` contains the string `'1'` as its second-to-last element. If the bit at position 0 of `x` was not set (i.e., `x` is an even number), `s` contains the string `'0'` as its second-to-last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `range(30)` remains a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. If the bit at position 1 of `x` is set (i.e., `x` is an odd number when considering the bit at position 1), `s` now contains the string `'1'` as its last element. Otherwise, `s` now contains the string `'0'` as its last element. Additionally, if the bit at position 0 of `x` was set (i.e., `x` is an odd number), `s` contains the string `'1'` as its second-to-last element. If the bit at position 0 of `x` was not set (i.e., `x` is an even number), `s` contains the string `'0'` as its second-to-last element. If the bit at position 2 of `x` is set, `'1'` is appended to `s`. Otherwise, `'0'` is appended to `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
