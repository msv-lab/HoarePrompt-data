Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 29, `t` is greater than 29, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position of the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit). If `flag` is 1 and the second element of `s` is '0', then the second element of `s` is '1' and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, the first element of `s` is '0'.***
