Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `range(30)` is a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0. If the bit at position 1 in `x` is set to 1, `s` is a list containing the strings '1' and '1'. If the bit at position 1 in `x` is 0, `s` is a list containing the strings '0' and '1' if the bit at position 0 in `x` is 1, or '0' and '0' if the bit at position 0 in `x` is 0.**
