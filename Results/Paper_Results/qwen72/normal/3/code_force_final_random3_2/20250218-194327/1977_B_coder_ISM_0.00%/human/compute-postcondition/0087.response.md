The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `range(30)`. The loop will execute if the range has at least one element, which it does (it has 30 elements, from 0 to 29). However, the initial state of `i` is 28, which is not relevant to the loop head since `i` will be reset to 0 by the loop. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop head is correctly set up for the first iteration, which means `i` should start from 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `range(30)` remains a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0**
