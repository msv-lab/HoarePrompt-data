Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 30, `range(30)` remains a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the binary state of the corresponding bit position in `x` (from bit position 0 to bit position 29). If the bit at position `i` of `x` is set (i.e., 1), the string `'1'` is appended to `s`; otherwise, the string `'0'` is appended to `s`. The other variables (`nalla`, `t`, `x`, and `length`) remain unchanged. `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `range(0, 29)` remains a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[0]` is set to '-1', `s[1]` is '1', and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and `s[0]` is '0', `s[0]` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. In all other cases, `flag` remains 0, and the other variables (`nalla`, `t`, `x`, and `length`) remain unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `range(0, 29)` remains a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[0]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[1]` is '0', then `s[0]` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. In all other cases, `s[1]` is '1', `flag` remains 0, and `s[0]` remains unchanged. The other variables (`nalla`, `t`, `x`, and `length`) remain unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `range(0, 29)` remains a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. If `flag` is 0 and `s[2]` is equal to `s[3]` and both are '1', then `s[2]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is not 0 and `s[2]` is '0', then `s[2]` is updated to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. The other variables (`nalla`, `t`, `x`, and `length`) remain unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
