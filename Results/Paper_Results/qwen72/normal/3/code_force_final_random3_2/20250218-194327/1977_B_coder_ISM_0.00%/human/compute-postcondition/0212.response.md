Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 29, `t` is greater than 29, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings representing the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit). The second element of `s` is '1'. If `flag` is 0 and the second and third elements of `s` are both '1', the second element of `s` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and the second element of `s` is '0', the second element of `s` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If neither of these conditions is met, the first element of `s` is '0'.**
