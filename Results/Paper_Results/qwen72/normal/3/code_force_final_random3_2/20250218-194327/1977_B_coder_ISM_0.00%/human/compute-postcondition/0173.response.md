Output State: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing the string '0', `nalla` is 29, `t` is greater than 29, `x` is an input integer, and the bit at position `i` (0) in `x` is 0.** 

The code appends the string '0' to the list `s`, which was initially empty. The other variables remain unchanged.
