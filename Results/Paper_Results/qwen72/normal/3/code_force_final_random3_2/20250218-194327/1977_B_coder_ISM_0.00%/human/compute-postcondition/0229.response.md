Postcondition: ***`i` is 28, `length` is 31, `nalla` is 29, `t` is greater than 29, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 31 strings representing the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit). If `flag` is 1, the last element of `s` is '1' and `s[29]` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, `s` retains its original 30 elements, and the `flag` remains 0. Additionally, either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.***
