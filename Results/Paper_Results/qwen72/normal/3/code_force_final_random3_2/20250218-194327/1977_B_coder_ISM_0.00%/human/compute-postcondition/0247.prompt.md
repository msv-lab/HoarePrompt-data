Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    print(*s)
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all 29 iterations, the value of `i` is 28, `range(0, 29)` remains a sequence of 29 integers starting from 0, and `s` is a list of 30 or 31 strings. The loop iterates through the list `s` from index 1 to `length-1` (where `length` is 30 or 31), and for each index `i`, if `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i-1]` is '1', it sets `s[i]` to '0' and `s[i-1]` to '-1'. The final state of `s` will reflect all such changes that have been made throughout the 29 iterations. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', the 30th element of `s` (i.e., `s[29]`) is now '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', `s` is a list of 31 strings, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', and `length` is increased by 1. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains a list of 30 strings, and `s[29]` is not '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all 29 iterations, `i` is 28, `length` is 30 or 31. The string `s` will have all occurrences of the pattern '1-1' replaced with '-10'. The rest of the string `s` remains unchanged. The variables `nalla`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `length - 1`, `length` is 30 or 31, and the string `s` has been processed such that any occurrence of '1' followed by '-1' has been replaced by '0' and '-1', respectively, for all indices from 1 to `length - 1`. The variables `nalla`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the `flag` remains as it was initially (either 0 or 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
