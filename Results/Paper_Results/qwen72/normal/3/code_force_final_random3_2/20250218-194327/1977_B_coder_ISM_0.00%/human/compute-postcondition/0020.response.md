To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 29.
   - `range(30)` is a sequence of 30 integers starting from 0, i.e., `[0, 1, 2, ..., 29]`.
   - `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is '1' if the corresponding bit in `x` is set to 1, and '0' if the corresponding bit in `x` is 0.

2. **Understanding `s`:**
   - The list `s` is constructed based on the binary representation of `x`.
   - Each element in `s` corresponds to a bit in `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
   - If the bit at position `j` in `x` is 1, then `s[j]` is '1'.
   - If the bit at position `j` in `x` is 0, then `s[j]` is '0'.

3. **Determine the value of `x`:**
   - The initial state does not explicitly provide the value of `x`.
   - However, we can infer that `x` is a 30-bit integer, and `s` is a list of 30 strings representing the binary form of `x`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*s)` statement will print all elements of the list `s` separated by spaces.

5. **Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact sequence of '1's and '0's in `s`.
   - However, we know that `s` will contain 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`.

Output: **30 elements of '1' or '0' separated by spaces (where each element represents a bit in the 30-bit integer `x`)**
