Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 29, `t` is greater than 29, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position of the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit), `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 29, `t` is greater than 29, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position of the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit). If `flag` is 0 and the first two elements of `s` are both '1', then the first element of `s` is set to '-1', the second element of `s` is '1', and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, the first element of `s` is '0' or the first element of `s` is '1' and the second element of `s` is not '1', or the first element of `s` is '1' and `flag` is not 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 29, `t` is greater than 29, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings representing the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit). If `flag` is 0 and the second and third elements of `s` are both '1', the second element of `s` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and the second element of `s` is '0', the second element of `s` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If neither of these conditions is met, the first element of `s` is '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 29, `t` is greater than 29, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings representing the binary representation of `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit). If `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '1', and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`, then the third element of `s` (index 2) is set to `'-1'`, and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and the second element of `s` is '0', the second element of `s` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If none of these conditions are met, the first element of `s` is '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
