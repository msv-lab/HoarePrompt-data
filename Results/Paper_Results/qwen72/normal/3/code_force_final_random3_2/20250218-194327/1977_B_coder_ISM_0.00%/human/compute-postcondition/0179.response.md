The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `30`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `30`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and the loop is set to run for 30 iterations. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 2, and the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than 30.

State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 29, `t` is greater than 29, `x` is an input integer. If the least significant bit of `x` is 1, then `s` is a list containing the strings '1', '1'. If the least significant bit of `x` is 0, then `s` is a list containing the strings '0', '0'.**
