The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and `x`. The loop iterates over `y` in the range from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `x - 1` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decreased by 1, and it must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 2` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` and `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
