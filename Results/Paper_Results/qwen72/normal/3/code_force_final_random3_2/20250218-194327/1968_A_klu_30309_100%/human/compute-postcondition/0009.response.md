Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x - 1` and must be greater than 0, `y` is `x - 1` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `best_y` is updated to `y`.
- The value of `y` is `x - 1`, which is a positive integer greater than 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `max_sum`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `best_y` is now `x - 1`, which is the same as the value of `y`.
