Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is 1.**

The code snippet `best_y = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `best_y`. Since `best_y` was already 1 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
