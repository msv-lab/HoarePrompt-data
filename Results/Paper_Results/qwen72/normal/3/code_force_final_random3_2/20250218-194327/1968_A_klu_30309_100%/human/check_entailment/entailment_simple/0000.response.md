### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then reads `t` integers from the input, each representing a value of `x` for which the program needs to find the optimal `y`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (list of integers `x`).

3. **Initialization**:
   - For each `x` in `test_cases`, the program initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1. This is a reasonable starting point because the smallest possible `y` is 1, and the sum of `gcd(x, 1) + 1` is always 2, which is a valid initial value for `max_sum`.

4. **Loop to Find Optimal `y`**:
   - The program iterates over possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates `gcd_val` using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
   - It then calculates `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`.
   - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current `y`.
   - The `break` statement after the update is incorrect. It causes the loop to terminate early, potentially missing better values of `y` that could yield a higher `max_sum`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program appends `best_y` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

### Issues:
- The `break` statement in the loop is premature. It should be removed to ensure that the loop continues to check all possible values of `y` and finds the maximum possible `gcd(x, y) + y`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
        results.append(best_y)
    return results
```

### Correctness:
- **False**: The original program is incorrect because the `break` statement causes the loop to terminate early, potentially missing the optimal `y` for each `x`.

### Corrected Program Explanation:
- By removing the `break` statement, the loop will check all values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1, ensuring that the maximum possible value of `gcd(x, y) + y` is found for each `x`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
