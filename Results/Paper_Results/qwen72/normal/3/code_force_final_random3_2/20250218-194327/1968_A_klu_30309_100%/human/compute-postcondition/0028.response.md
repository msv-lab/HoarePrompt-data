The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and the list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second integer in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first integer in the list, and `test_cases` must have at least 1 integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least 2 integers, and `x` will be the second integer in the list.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is the greatest value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the loop, `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced the greatest `max_sum`, and `y` is 0 (or 1 if `x` was 2).**
