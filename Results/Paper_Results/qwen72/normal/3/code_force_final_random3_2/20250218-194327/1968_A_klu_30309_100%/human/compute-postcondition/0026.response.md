Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is the greatest value of `gcd_val + y` encountered during the loop, `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced the greatest `max_sum`, and `y` is 0 (or 1 if `x` was 2).**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000.
- The list `test_cases` remains unchanged and contains integers between 2 and 1000.
- The variable `x` is still the first integer in the list `test_cases` and is at least 2.
- The list `results` remains empty.
- The variable `max_sum` is updated to the highest value of the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` plus `y` encountered during the loop.
- The variable `best_y` is updated to the value of `y` that produced the highest `max_sum`.
- The variable `y` is 0 if `x` was greater than 2, or 1 if `x` was 2, because the loop decrements `y` from `x - 1` down to 1. If `x` was 2, the loop only runs once with `y` being 1. If `x` was greater than 2, the loop runs until `y` reaches 1, and then the loop terminates.
