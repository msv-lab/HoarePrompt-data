Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 2` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, and `best_y` is now equal to `y`.**

In natural language: The code assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `best_y` is now equal to `y`, which is `x - 2` and must be greater than 0. The initial state of the other variables is still valid: `t` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer is between 2 and 1000 and contains at least one integer, `x` is the first integer in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `results` is an empty list, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`, and `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`.
