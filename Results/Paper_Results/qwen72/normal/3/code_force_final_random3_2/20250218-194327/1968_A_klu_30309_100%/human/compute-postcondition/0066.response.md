The only objects in the loop head are variables `y` and `x`. The loop iterates over `y` in the range from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `y` was `x - 1` and `x` is the third integer in the list `test_cases` and must be at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be decreased by 1, so `y` becomes `x - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than 0. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` appended to it, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 1`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**
