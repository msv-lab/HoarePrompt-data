Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list (and must be at least 2), `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is `x - 1`, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is `x - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum`.
- `current_sum` is `x - 1`, so `max_sum` is also `x - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `best_y`, `y`, `gcd_val`) remain unchanged.
