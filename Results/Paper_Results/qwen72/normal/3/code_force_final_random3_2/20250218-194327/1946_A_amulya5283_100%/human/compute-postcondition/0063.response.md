Output State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 2 and still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `mdx`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n`, `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`mdx`**: The value of `mdx` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from `mdx` to `n-1`.
- **`res`**: The value of `res` is the count of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to the element at index `mdx`. This is because the loop checks each element from `a[mdx]` to `a[n-1]` and increments `res` if the element is equal to `a[mdx]`.
