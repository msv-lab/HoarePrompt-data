Output State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 1 and still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n`, `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` while keeping the initial state of the other variables intact.
