Output State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 2 and still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n`, `res` is 0.**

The code snippet `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` recalculates the value of `mdx` based on the current value of `n`. The value of `mdx` is updated to be the integer division of `n` by 2, plus the remainder of `n` divided by 2, minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `mdx` while keeping the initial state of the other variables intact.
