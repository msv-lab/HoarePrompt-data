Output State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 2 and still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. If `n` is 1, the postcondition is as described. If `n` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `mdx`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still the previous value of `t` minus 2, and it is still greater than 0.
- The value of `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input.
- The value of `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- The value of `i` remains `n`.
- The value of `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
- If `n` is 1, the postcondition is as described.
- If `n` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `mdx`.
