The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `mdx`, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mdx + 1`.

State: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is set to 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
