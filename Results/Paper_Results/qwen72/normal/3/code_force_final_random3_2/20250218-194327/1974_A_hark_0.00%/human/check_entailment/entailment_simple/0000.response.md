### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is not used in the program, so it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - The function calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`). This is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a screen is 3 (since \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cells).
     - The function then updates `x` to account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons: `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This is incorrect because it does not properly account for the space used by the 2x2 icons. The correct approach should be to subtract the number of cells used by the 2x2 icons from the total available cells, and then calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons.
     - The function calculates `bxsfory1` as `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. This is also incorrect because it adds 1 unnecessarily. The correct approach should be to simply calculate the number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - Finally, it prints `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`, which is incorrect due to the previous errors.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - The function correctly prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - The function correctly prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - The function correctly prints `0`, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - **Loop**: The function correctly calls `func_2()` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the logic in `func_2` for handling the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and `bxsfory1` is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
