### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is a simple utility to return the minimum of two values. It is not directly involved in solving the main problem but can be used for comparisons.
   - **Correctness**: The function works correctly for its intended purpose.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - It then calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.
   - The logic is as follows:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - Update `x` to account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons: `x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`.
       - Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` if `x` is still positive, otherwise 0.
       - Print the total number of screens: `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - Print the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - Print the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - Print 0.
   - **Correctness**: The logic for calculating the minimum number of screens is flawed. Specifically, the update to `x` is incorrect. The formula `x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4` does not correctly account for the space used by 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. Therefore, the correct update should be `x - (math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 - y * 4)` to account for the space used by 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and calls `func_2` for each test case.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly handles the input and calls `func_2` the appropriate number of times.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the logic in `func_2` for updating `x` and calculating the number of screens is flawed. The formula used to update `x` does not correctly account for the space used by 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

### Correctness: **False**
