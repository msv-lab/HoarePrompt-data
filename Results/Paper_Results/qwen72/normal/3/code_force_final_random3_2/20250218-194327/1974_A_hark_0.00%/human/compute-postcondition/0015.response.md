Postcondition: **x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and x, y are assigned the values from the input. If x is 0 and y is greater than 0, the current value of x is 0, and the current value of y is greater than 0. If x is greater than 0 and y is 0, then x is greater than 0 and y is 0. Otherwise, either x is 0, or y is not 0.**
