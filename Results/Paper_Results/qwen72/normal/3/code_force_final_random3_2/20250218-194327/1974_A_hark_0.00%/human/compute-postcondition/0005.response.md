The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `func_2()` has been called. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but since the loop variable `_` is not used, it does not affect the state. The loop will decrement `t` by 1 after each iteration, so for the next iteration, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `func_2()` has been called.** 

However, to be more precise about the state at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `func_2()` has been called.**
