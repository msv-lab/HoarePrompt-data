The function `func_3` reads a non-negative integer `t` from user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and calls the function `func_2` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `t` remains a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, and `func_2` has been executed `t` times. The function does not return any value.
