Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. This line attempts to adjust the number of 1x1 icons by subtracting the number of 1x1 icon slots that are occupied by 2x2 icons, but it does so in a way that does not accurately reflect the actual space used.

### Problem with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Adjustment for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is supposed to adjust the number of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this adjustment is incorrect because:
     - `bxsfory * 15` is the total number of 1x1 icon slots that could be occupied by 2x2 icons if each 2x2 icon were placed in a new screen.
     - `y * 4` is the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
     - The correct adjustment should be `x = x - (bxsfory * 11)`, where `11` is the number of 1x1 icon slots left after placing one 2x2 icon in a screen (since a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 15 - 4 = 11 cells for 1x1 icons).

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  12 4
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  The program will output `2`, but the logic is flawed. If we place 4 2x2 icons, we need 2 screens (since each screen can hold 2 2x2 icons). After placing the 2x2 icons, we have 12 - (2 * 11) = 12 - 22 = -10, which is incorrect. The program should correctly handle the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
import math

def func_2(x, y):
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 11  # Correct adjustment for 1x1 icons
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        func_2(x, y)

func_3()
```

This corrected code should handle all potential cases correctly.
