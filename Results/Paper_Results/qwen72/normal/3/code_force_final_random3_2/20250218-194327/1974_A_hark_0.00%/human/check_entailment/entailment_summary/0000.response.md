Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` in `func_3`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` to handle the input and compute the result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - It then calculates the minimum number of screens required to fit all the icons:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`) and adjusts the number of 1x1 icons based on the space taken by the 2x2 icons. It then calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons and prints the total.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`).
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons (`math.ceil(x / 15)`).
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is not used in the program. It returns the minimum of two values but is not called anywhere in the code.

4. **Overall Program Behavior**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
   - The function `func_3` correctly iterates over the test cases and calls `func_2` for each one.

Given the above reasoning, the program meets the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
