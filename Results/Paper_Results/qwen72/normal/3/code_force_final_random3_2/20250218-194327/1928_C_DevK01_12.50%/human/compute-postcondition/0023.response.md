Output State: **`q` is at least 4, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `M` is a list that includes the value `q // i` in addition to any previous values.**

Explanation:
- The value of `q` remains at least 4.
- The value of `w` remains the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 3.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `q // i` is calculated and added to the list `M`. Since `i` is 3, `q // i` is the integer division of `q` by 3. The list `M` now includes this new value in addition to any previous values it had.
