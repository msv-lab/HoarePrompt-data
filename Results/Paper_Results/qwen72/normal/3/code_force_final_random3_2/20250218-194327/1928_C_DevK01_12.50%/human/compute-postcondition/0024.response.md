Postcondition: ***`q` is at least 4, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `M` remains unchanged unless `q % i == 0`. If `q % i == 0` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `w - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the value `q // i` in addition to any previous values. If `q % i == 0` and `i` is greater than or equal to `w - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 2 and `q // 2`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the value `i` in addition to any previous values. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.***
