Output State: **`q` is at least 4, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `M` is a list that now includes the value `i` in addition to any previous values.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 3.
- The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `M`.
- The other conditions and values (`q` being at least 4, `w` being the integer square root of `q` and greater than 3) remain unchanged.
- The list `M` now includes the value 3, in addition to any values it might have had before based on the initial conditions.
