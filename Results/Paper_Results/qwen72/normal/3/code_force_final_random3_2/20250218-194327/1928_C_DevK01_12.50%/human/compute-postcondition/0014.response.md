To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `q` is at least 4.
- `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If `q` is divisible by `i` without any remainder, and `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list containing `[1]`.
- If `q` is divisible by `i` without any remainder, and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list containing `[1, q // i]`.
- If `q` is not divisible by `i`, `M` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `w`.
2. **Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Value of `i`**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(w // 1)`.
5. **Current State of `w`**: `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 1. Since `q` is at least 4, `w` must be at least 2.
6. **Next Value of `w`**: `w` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.
7. **Condition Check**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(w // 1)`. Since `i` is now 2, `int(w // 1)` must be greater than 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `w` remains the same, and `int(w // 1)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`q` is at least 4, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `M` remains unchanged**.
