The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. Both `q` and `x` are integers with the constraints 1 <= x < q <= 10^9. The function returns a list `M` that contains all integers `i` and `q // i` where `i` is a divisor of `q` and both `i` and `q // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
