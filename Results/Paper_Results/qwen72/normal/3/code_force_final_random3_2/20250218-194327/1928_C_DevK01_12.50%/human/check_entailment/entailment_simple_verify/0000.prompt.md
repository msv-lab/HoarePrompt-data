You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in the way it handles the calculation and the conditions for determining valid values of \( k \). Specifically, the function `func_1` and the main loop have some problems that can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Issues:
1. **Handling of `w` (square root of `q`):**
   - The program checks if `w` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, it should also check if `w` is a valid \( k \) by ensuring that it fits the pattern described in the problem.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the program calculates `y = 12` and `q = 5`. The square root of `5` is not an integer, so `w` is not added to `M`. However, \( k = 5 \) is a valid solution in this case, but the program misses it.

2. **Range of `i` in `func_1`:**
   - The loop in `func_1` iterates from `1` to `int(w) - 1`, which can miss valid \( k \) values. For example, if `q = 10` and `x = 3`, the loop only checks `i` up to `3` (since `w = 3.16`), but it should check all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

3. **Condition for adding `q // i` to `M`:**
   - The program checks if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and adds it to `M`. However, it should also check if `q // i` is a valid \( k \) by ensuring it fits the pattern described in the problem.

### Example Case:
For the input `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the correct output should be `4` because \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) are valid. However, the program outputs `3` because it misses \( k = 5 \).

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Calculate the range of possible \( k \) values based on the given \( n \) and \( x \).
- Check if each \( k \) fits the pattern described in the problem.
- Count the number of valid \( k \) values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    valid_ks = set()
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) < k - 1 and (n - 1) // (2 * k - 2) * (2 * k - 2) + x == n:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    return len(valid_ks)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_ks(n, x))
```

This corrected version correctly handles the calculation and checks for valid \( k \) values, ensuring that it meets the problem description for every potential case.
