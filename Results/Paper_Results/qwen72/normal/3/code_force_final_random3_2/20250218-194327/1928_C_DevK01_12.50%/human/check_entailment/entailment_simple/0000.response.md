### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `x`.
   - This matches the problem description where `t` is the number of test cases and each test case consists of `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (the number he received).

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y % 2 != 0`. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - This check is necessary because the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and `n + x` must be even for a valid `k` to exist. If `y` is odd, no valid `k` can exist, so the output `0` is correct.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and stores the result in `L1`.
   - This function is designed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, where `q = (y - 2) // 2`.

4. **Additional Check**:
   - The program checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`. If true, it calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` and appends the result to `L1`.
   - This check is based on the observation that if `n` is large enough, additional valid `k` values can be found by considering the second part of the settling pattern.

5. **Set Conversion and Output**:
   - The program converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and then prints the length of the set.
   - This ensures that each valid `k` is counted only once.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It first checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the square root to the list `M`.
   - It then iterates through all integers from `1` to `int(w) - 1` (where `w` is the square root of `q`), checking if they are divisors of `q` and if they or their corresponding quotient are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - This approach ensures that all valid divisors are found and added to the list `M`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find all valid `k` values based on the given constraints and the problem description. The checks and function calls are appropriate, and the final output is the correct number of valid `k` values for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
