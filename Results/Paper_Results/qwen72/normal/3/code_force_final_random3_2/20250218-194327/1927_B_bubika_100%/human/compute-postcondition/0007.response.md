Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `s`, `r` is an empty string, `x` is -1 because `i` is not found in `b` (since `b` is a list of 26 zeros and `i` is the first integer in `s`, which is not zero).**
