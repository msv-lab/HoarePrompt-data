Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. It returns 'Alice' if the smallest number in `arr` is not 1 or if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive unique numbers in `arr`. Otherwise, it returns 'Alice' if the number of unique elements in `arr` is odd, and 'Bob' if the number of unique elements is even. **
