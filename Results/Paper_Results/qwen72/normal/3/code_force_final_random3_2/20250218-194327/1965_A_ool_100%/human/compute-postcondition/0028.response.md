The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in `arr` represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. The function returns 'Alice' if the difference between any consecutive elements in `arr` is greater than 1, or if no such difference exists and the initial value of `A` is True. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob' if the initial value of `A` is False.
