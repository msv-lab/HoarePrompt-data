Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, and the first element of `set_` is 1; if any difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` is False and the program executes the if part, setting `A` to the negation of its initial value and `i` to the index where the loop broke or `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completed all iterations. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True and `A` retains the value it was last set to before the loop broke.***
