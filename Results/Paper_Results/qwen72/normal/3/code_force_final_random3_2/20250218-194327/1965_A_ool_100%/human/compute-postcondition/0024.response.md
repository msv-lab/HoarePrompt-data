Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, and the first element of `set_` is 1; all differences between consecutive elements in `set_` are 1; `not_c` is True; `A` is the negation of the initial value of `A`; `i` is the index where the loop broke or `len(set_) - 1` if the loop completed all iterations.**
