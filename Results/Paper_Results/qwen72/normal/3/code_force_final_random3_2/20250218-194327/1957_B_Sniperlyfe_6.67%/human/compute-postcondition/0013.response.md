The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`. The function returns a list `nums` of `n` elements. Each element in the list, except the last one, is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. The last element in the list is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1 + k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of `n` elements. Each element in the list, except the last one, is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. The last element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1 + k`.**
