Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is now `k - n * ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`, `nums` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and the last element of `nums` is now `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1 + k`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nums[-1] += k` adds the value of `k` to the last element of the list `nums`. Initially, each element in `nums` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. After the addition, the last element of `nums` becomes `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1 + k`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the value of `k` is still `k - n * ((1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1)`.
