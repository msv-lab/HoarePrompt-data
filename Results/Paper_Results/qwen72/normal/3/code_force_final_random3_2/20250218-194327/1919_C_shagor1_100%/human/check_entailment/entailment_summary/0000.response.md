### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `inp`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variables `la` and `lb` are initialized to `n + 1`. These variables are used to track the smallest and second smallest elements in the array, respectively.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the minimum penalty.

3. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through each element `i` in the array `inp`.
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `la`, it updates `la` to `i`.
   - If `i` is greater than `la` but less than or equal to `lb`, it updates `lb` to `i`.
   - If `i` is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it updates `la` to `lb` and `lb` to `i`, and increments `ans` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program aims to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences such that the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences is minimized.
- The logic of updating `la` and `lb` ensures that the smallest and second smallest elements are always tracked. This helps in identifying the points where an element is greater than both `la` and `lb`, which indicates an increasing pair.
- The increment of `ans` by 1 each time an element is greater than both `la` and `lb` correctly counts the number of such increasing pairs.

### Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `5 1 2 3 4 5`
  - Output: `3`
  - Explanation: The array can be split as `s = [2, 4, 5]` and `t = [1, 3]`, resulting in 2 increasing pairs in `s` and 1 in `t`, giving a total penalty of 3.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `8 8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: The array can be split as `s = [8, 3, 1]` and `t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, resulting in 0 increasing pairs in `s` and 1 in `t`, giving a total penalty of 1.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `5 3 3 3 3 3`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: The array can be split as `s = []` and `t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, resulting in 0 increasing pairs in both subsequences, giving a total penalty of 0.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: The array can be split as `s = []` and `t = [1]`, resulting in 0 increasing pairs in both subsequences, giving a total penalty of 0.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `2 2 1`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: The array can be split as `s = [2]` and `t = [1]`, resulting in 0 increasing pairs in both subsequences, giving a total penalty of 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for each test case. The execution summary and the provided test cases confirm that the program behaves as expected.

### Correctness:
**True**
