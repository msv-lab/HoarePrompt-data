### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of the array `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads the array `ar` for each test case.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `same` is initialized to 1, which will be used to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - The variable `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity) to keep track of the minimum segment length of consecutive identical elements.

3. **Loop Through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array using a while loop with index `i`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, it increments the `same` counter.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it:
     - Increments `i` by 1 to move to the next element.
     - Updates `num` to the current element `ar[i]`.
     - Updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - Resets `same` to 1 to start counting the new segment of identical elements.
   - However, there is a logical error in the loop. When `ar[i]` is different from `num`, the program increments `i` by 1 and then immediately updates `num` to `ar[i]` and increments `i` again. This means that the next element is skipped, which can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time to account for the last segment of identical elements.
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements.
- However, due to the double increment of `i` when `ar[i]` is different from `num`, the program may skip elements and thus fail to correctly identify the minimum segment length.
- If the array consists of all identical elements, `minn` will remain `inf`, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.
- If the array has segments of different lengths, the program may output an incorrect result due to the double increment issue.

### Edge Cases:
- **All Elements are the Same:**
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` because removing any number of elements will not change the fact that all elements are the same.
- **Array with Multiple Segments:**
  - The program may output an incorrect result due to the double increment issue. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program might skip the second `1` and incorrectly identify the minimum segment length.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described due to the double increment issue in the loop. This can lead to incorrect results for arrays with multiple segments of different lengths.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
