Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) and the length of each sublist n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) is provided in the first element of the sublist. Additionally, in every test case, the given array a is beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to accept the parameters as described. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the array `a` for each test case.
