### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar` itself.

2. **Consecutive Elements Counting:**
   - The function initializes `same` to 1, which is the count of consecutive occurrences of the current number.
   - It also initializes `num` to the first element of the array and `minn` to infinity (`inf`), which will be used to track the minimum length of consecutive sequences.

3. **Loop Through the Array:**
   - The function iterates through the array using a while loop.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, then resets `same` to 1 and updates `num` to the current element.

4. **Final Update:**
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time to ensure the last sequence is considered.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there were no sequences of consecutive elements, and the function prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum length of consecutive sequences found.

5. **Logic for Making the Array Not Beautiful:**
   - The function aims to find the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same number. This is because removing elements from the smallest consecutive sequence can potentially break the "beautiful" property of the array.
   - However, the function does not explicitly check if the array can be made not beautiful by removing elements. It only finds the smallest consecutive sequence.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For arrays where all elements are the same (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`), the function correctly prints `-1` because removing any element will not make the array not beautiful.
   - For arrays with mixed elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`), the function correctly identifies the smallest consecutive sequence and prints the minimum number of elements to remove to potentially break the "beautiful" property.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same number.
- However, the function does not explicitly check if removing the minimum number of elements from the smallest consecutive sequence will indeed make the array not beautiful. This is a critical part of the problem, and the function is missing this check.

### Conclusion:
- The function is incomplete and does not fully solve the problem as described. It needs to include a check to ensure that removing the minimum number of elements from the smallest consecutive sequence will make the array not beautiful.

### Correctness: **False**
