Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the list `ar`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- The list `ar` remains the same list of integers provided by the user input.
- The loop counter `i` has incremented to the length of the list `ar`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `num` is now the last element of the list `ar`, as the loop updates `num` to the current element being checked in each iteration.
- The variable `same` is reset to 1 after the last iteration, as the loop always resets `same` to 1 when it encounters a different element.
- The variable `minn` is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements found in the list `ar`. This is because the loop updates `minn` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `same` whenever it encounters a different element.
