Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar`.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1, and the current value of `minn` is `inf`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `same`, and `minn` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the integer `-1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
