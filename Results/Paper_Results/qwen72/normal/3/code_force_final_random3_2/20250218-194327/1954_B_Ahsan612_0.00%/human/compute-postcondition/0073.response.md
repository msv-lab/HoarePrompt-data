Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 4 elements, `len(ar)` must be greater than 5, `i` is increased by 1, `minn` is always 1.**

- If `ar[i]` was equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`), then `same` is 4 and `i` was 3, now `i` is 4.
- If `ar[i-1]` was equal to `num` but `ar[i]` was not, then `same` is 2, `i` was 5, now `i` is 6, and `num` is the element at index `i-1` of `ar`.
- If neither `ar[i-1]` nor `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `same` is 1, `i` was either 4 or 6, now `i` is either 5 or 7, and `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`.
