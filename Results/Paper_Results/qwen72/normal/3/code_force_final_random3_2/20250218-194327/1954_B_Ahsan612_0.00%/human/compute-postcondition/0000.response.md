To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is used as a placeholder for the loop index, which is not used within the loop body. This variable does not need to be adjusted as it will be automatically set by the loop.
2. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) and the length of each sublist `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) is provided in the first element of the sublist.
- Additionally, in every test case, the given array `a` is beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is valid and meets the criteria for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
