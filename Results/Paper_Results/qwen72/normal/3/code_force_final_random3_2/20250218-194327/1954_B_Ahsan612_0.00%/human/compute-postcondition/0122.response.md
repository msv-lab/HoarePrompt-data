The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `cases` contains `t` sublists, each representing a test case. Each sublist contains integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where the first element of the sublist is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the array `a` in every test case is beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The exact nature of the result for each test case is not specified, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and produces a specific output based on the input.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. It processes each of the `t` test cases, where each test case is a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` with the first element being `n`. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
