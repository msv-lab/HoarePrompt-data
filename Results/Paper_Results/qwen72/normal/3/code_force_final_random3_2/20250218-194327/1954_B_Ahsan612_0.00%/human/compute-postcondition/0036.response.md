Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `ar` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
   - The current value of `minn` is `inf` (which stands for infinity).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `minn`, and `i` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **-1**
