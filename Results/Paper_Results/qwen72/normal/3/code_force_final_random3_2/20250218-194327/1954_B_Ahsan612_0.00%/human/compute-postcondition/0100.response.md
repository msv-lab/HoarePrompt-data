Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar` (`num`), then `same` is 2 and `minn` remains `inf`, and `i` is now 4. Otherwise, `i` is now 4, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `same` remains 1, and `minn` is set to 1.**
