The value of `same` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `same` is either 2 or 1, depending on whether `ar[i]` is equal to `num` or not. Therefore, if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` becomes 3. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, `same` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `i`, and `minn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 4 elements, `num` is the first element of `ar`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 3 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 2, `i` is 3, and `minn` is 1, with `num` being the third element of `ar`.**
