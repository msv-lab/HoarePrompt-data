The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`), then `same` is 2 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `i` is 3, and `minn` is 1.**
