Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 4 elements, `same` is either 1 or 3, `i` is either 4 or 6, `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of 1 and `same`, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5.**

Explanation:
- The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.
- If `same` is 3, `minn` remains 1 because `min(1, 3)` is 1.
- If `same` is 1, `minn` remains 1 because `min(1, 1)` is 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, and `num` are not affected by this code snippet.
