Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum length of any contiguous subsequence of equal elements in the list `ar`, and `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- **`n`**: Remains an input integer greater than 0.
- **`ar`**: Remains the list of integers provided by the user.
- **`same`**: After the loop finishes, `same` is reset to 1. This is because the loop increments `same` when it encounters consecutive elements that are the same, but it resets `same` to 1 whenever it encounters a different element.
- **`minn`**: This variable holds the minimum length of any contiguous subsequence of equal elements found in the list `ar`. For example, if the list has a subsequence like `[3, 3, 3]` and another subsequence like `[5, 5]`, `minn` will be 2, as the shortest subsequence of equal elements has a length of 2.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`. This is because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, and it stops when `i` reaches the length of `ar`.
