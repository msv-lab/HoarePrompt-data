Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the first element of `ar`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 2 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `i` is 2, and `minn` is 1, with `num` being the third element of `ar`.***
