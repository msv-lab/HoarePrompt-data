Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique number in the list `ar`, `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list, and `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` that was encountered during the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- **`n`**: Remains the new input integer greater than 0.
- **`ar`**: The list of integers provided by the user input remains unchanged.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list.
- **`num`**: This variable holds the last unique number in the list `ar` that was encountered during the loop.
- **`same`**: This variable holds the count of consecutive occurrences of the last unique number `num` at the end of the list.
- **`minn`**: This variable holds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` that was encountered during the loop. If no number had consecutive occurrences, `minn` will be `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` will be the smallest count of consecutive occurrences found in the list.
