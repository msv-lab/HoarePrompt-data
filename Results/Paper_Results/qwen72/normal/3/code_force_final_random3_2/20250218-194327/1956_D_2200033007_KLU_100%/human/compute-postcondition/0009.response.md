Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 1`, `j` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + j < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `is_already_stairs` is set to `False`.
- The other variables (`i`, `j`, `arr`, `start_index`, `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition `i + 1 > 1` and `start_index + j < len(arr)` are still valid.
- The condition that `is_already_stairs` is `False` if the element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` is not equal to `j` is now explicitly satisfied.
