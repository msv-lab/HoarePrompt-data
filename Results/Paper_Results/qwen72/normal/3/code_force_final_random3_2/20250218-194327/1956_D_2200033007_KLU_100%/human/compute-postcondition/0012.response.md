Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. All elements at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i` are equal to `j`, and `is_already_stairs` is `True`.**
