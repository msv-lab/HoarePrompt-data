Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers such that `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)`, `j` is `start_index + 1`, `arr[start_index]` is `i`, `arr[j]` is `i`.**

The value of `i` is assigned to the element at index `j` in the list `arr`. The value of `j` is `start_index + 1`, so the element at index `start_index + 1` in `arr` is now also `i`. The other preconditions remain unchanged.
