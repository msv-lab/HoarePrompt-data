Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is `True`, and the element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` is not equal to `j`.**
