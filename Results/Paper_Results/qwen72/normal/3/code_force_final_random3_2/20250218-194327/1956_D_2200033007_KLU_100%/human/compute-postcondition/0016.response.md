Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, and `res` now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i` is not equal to `j`. Additionally, the current value of `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The tuple `(start_index, start_index)` is appended to the list `res`.
- The values of `i`, `j`, `arr`, `start_index`, and `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged.
- The condition `i + 1 > 0` is still valid.
- The condition `start_index + i < len(arr)` is still valid.
- The condition that `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i` is not equal to `j` remains valid.
- The current value of `i` is still 0.
