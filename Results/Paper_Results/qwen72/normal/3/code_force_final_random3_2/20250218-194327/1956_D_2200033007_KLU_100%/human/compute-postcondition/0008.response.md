The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `i`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `i + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is 1, and `start_index + j < len(arr)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `i + 1`. Therefore, `i + 1` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 1`, `j` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + j < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers. If the element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.**
