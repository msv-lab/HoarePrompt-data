To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions that need to be met for the loop to continue.

### Loop Head Analysis:
The loop head is:
```python
for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
```
This means the loop will iterate over the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` (exclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be true:
1. `j` must be within the range defined by `start_index` and `start_index + i + 1`.
2. `start_index + i + 1` must be less than or equal to the length of `arr` to ensure the range is valid and does not exceed the bounds of the list.

### Current State:
- `i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `start_index` is a non-negative integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers such that `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)`.
- `j` is `start_index`.
- `arr[start_index]` is now `i`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`j`**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. So, `j` will be `start_index + 1`.
- **`start_index`**: This remains the same as it is the starting point of the range.
- **`i`**: This remains the same as it defines the end of the range.
- **`arr`**: The list `arr` remains the same, but the condition `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
- `i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `start_index` is a non-negative integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers such that `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)`.
- `j` is `start_index + 1`.
- `arr[start_index]` is now `i`.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers such that `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)`, `j` is `start_index + 1`, `arr[start_index]` is now `i`**
