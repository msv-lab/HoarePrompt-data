Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i` is not equal to `j`. If `arr[start_index + i] == i`, the function `make_stairs` is called with `i - 1` as the argument. Otherwise, for all indices `k` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive), `arr[k]` is `i`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, with `i` now being `i - 1`.**
