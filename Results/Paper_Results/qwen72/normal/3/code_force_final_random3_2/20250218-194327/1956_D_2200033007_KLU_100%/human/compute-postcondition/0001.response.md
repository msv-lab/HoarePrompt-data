The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and the expression `i + 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i + 1`. If `i + 1` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The initial state of `i` being a non-negative integer and `start_index + i < len(arr)` ensures that `i` is valid, but we need to ensure that `i + 1` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `j` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is `True`**
