The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, which will execute with `i - 1` as the argument. The initial state provides that `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, and `i` is not equal to `0`. Therefore, `i - 1` is a non-negative integer. The function call will not change the values of `i`, `j`, `arr`, `start_index`, `res`, or `is_already_stairs` directly, but it will affect the program flow by executing the function with a new value of `i`.

Since the function `make_stairs` is being called recursively with `i - 1`, the state of the program will be the same as the initial state, except that the function `make_stairs` is now being executed with `i - 1` as the argument.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `start_index + i < len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element at index `start_index + j` in `arr` for `j` in the range `0` to `i` is not equal to `j`, and `i` is not equal to `0`. The function `make_stairs` is called with `i - 1` as the argument.**
