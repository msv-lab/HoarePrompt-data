**Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array `a` by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

2. **Function Analysis:**

   - **`func_1`:**
     - This function is designed to compute the maximum possible sum for a subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`.
     - It uses dynamic programming to store intermediate results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
     - For a subarray of length 1, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element at `start_index`.
     - For subarrays of length greater than 1, it computes the maximum sum by considering different splits and the MEX of the subarray.
     - The function correctly handles the base case and the recursive case, ensuring that the maximum sum is computed efficiently.

   - **`func_2`:**
     - This function is designed to generate the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
     - It first checks if the subarray length is 1 and returns an appropriate result.
     - If the maximum value for the subarray is equal to the square of the subarray length, it appends the entire subarray to the result list.
     - Otherwise, it searches for an index `i` that splits the subarray into two parts such that the sum of the maximum values of these parts plus the element at `i` equals the maximum value.
     - It recursively constructs the sequence of operations for the subarrays.
     - The function correctly handles the base case and the recursive case, ensuring that the sequence of operations is constructed correctly.

   - **`make_stairs`:**
     - This function is designed to transform a subarray into a "staircase" pattern where the elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to form a sequence from 0 to `i`.
     - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form and returns if it is.
     - If the subarray is not in the desired form, it recursively sets the elements to the MEX value.
     - The function correctly modifies the array and appends the operations to `res`.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - The program correctly computes the maximum sum using `func_1`.
   - The program correctly constructs the sequence of operations using `func_2` and `make_stairs`.
   - The functions are designed to handle all edge cases and ensure that the operations do not exceed the limit of 5 * 10^5.

**Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description by correctly computing the maximum sum and constructing a sequence of operations to achieve it. The functions are logically sound and handle the constraints and requirements of the problem.
