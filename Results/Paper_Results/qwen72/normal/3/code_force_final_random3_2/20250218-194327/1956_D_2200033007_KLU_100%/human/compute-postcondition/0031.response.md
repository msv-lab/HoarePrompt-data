Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers such that `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)`, `j` is `start_index + i`, and for all indices `k` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive), `arr[k]` is `i`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `i` remains unchanged and is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- The value of `start_index` remains unchanged and is a non-negative integer.
- The list `arr` is still a list of integers, and it is long enough such that `start_index + i + 1` is less than or equal to the length of `arr`.
- The variable `j` has reached the value `start_index + i`, which is the final index of the loop.
- All elements in the list `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) have been set to the value `i`.
