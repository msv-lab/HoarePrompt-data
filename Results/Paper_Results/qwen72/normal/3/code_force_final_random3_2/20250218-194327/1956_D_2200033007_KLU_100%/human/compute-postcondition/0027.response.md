The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `start_index`, `i`, and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `start_index` and `start_index + i + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `start_index` is a non-negative integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers such that `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)`.
- `j` is `start_index + i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be reset to `start_index` (since `j` is the loop variable and it will be incremented by the loop). The condition `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers such that `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)`, `j` is `start_index`, `arr[start_index]` is now `i`.**
