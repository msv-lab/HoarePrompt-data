Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements in an array by performing a specific operation no more than 5 * 10^5 times. The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to compute the maximum possible sum for a subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`.
   - It uses memoization to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - For a single-element subarray, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element itself, which is correct because the MEX of a single element can be at most 1.
   - For a multi-element subarray, it computes the maximum value by considering various splits and the MEX value of the entire subarray. The logic here is to find the optimal split that maximizes the sum.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.
   - It first checks if the subarray is a single element and returns an empty list if the element is greater than 0, or a list containing a single operation if the element is 0.
   - For multi-element subarrays, it checks if the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length. If so, it appends the entire subarray range to the result and returns it.
   - Otherwise, it searches for an optimal split point `i` and recursively constructs the operations for the subarrays defined by this split point.
   - The function correctly handles the cases where the optimal split is found and where it is not, ensuring that the operations are constructed correctly.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is responsible for transforming a subarray into a "staircase" pattern, where each element is set to its index within the subarray.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase pattern and returns if it is.
   - If the subarray is not in the staircase pattern, it recursively sets the elements to the correct values and appends the operations to `res`.
   - The function correctly handles the base case and the recursive case, ensuring that the subarray is transformed as required.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The main program reads the input, initializes the result dictionary, and calls `func_1` to compute the maximum sum.
   - It then calls `func_2` to construct the sequence of operations.
   - The results are printed in the required format.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program appears to correctly solve the problem. The use of memoization in `func_1` ensures that the solution is efficient, and the construction of operations in `func_2` is consistent with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
