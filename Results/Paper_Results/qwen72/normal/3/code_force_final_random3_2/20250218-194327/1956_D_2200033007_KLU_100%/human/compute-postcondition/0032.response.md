Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers such that `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)`, `j` is `start_index + i`, and for all indices `k` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive), `arr[k]` is `i`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, and `i` is now `i - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, which means the value of `i` is decremented by 1.
- The initial state variables `start_index`, `arr`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The condition `start_index + i + 1 <= len(arr)` still holds true, but now with the updated value of `i`.
- The values in `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) are still `i`, but the value of `i` has been updated to `i - 1`.
