### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing the MEX operation no more than 500,000 times.
   - The MEX operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index]` using dynamic programming.
   - It uses a dictionary `res_dict` to memoize results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the function returns the maximum of 1 and the single element in the subarray. This is incorrect because the MEX of a single element `a_i` should be `0` if `a_i != 0` and `1` if `a_i == 0`.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, it recursively computes the maximum sum by considering different splits of the subarray and the MEX value of the subarray. However, the function does not correctly compute the MEX value. It seems to be using a heuristic that is not aligned with the MEX definition.
   - The function incorrectly assumes that the maximum sum can be computed by splitting the array and adding the elements, which does not align with the MEX operation.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the maximum value and then tries to backtrack to find the operations that lead to this value.
   - The function has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the maximum value is equal to `length ** 2`. This condition is not aligned with the MEX operation and the problem's requirements.
   - The backtracking logic is flawed and does not correctly reconstruct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - The function checks if the subarray is already a staircase and returns if it is.
   - If the subarray is not a staircase, it recursively transforms the subarray.
   - The function updates the subarray and appends the operation to the result list `res`.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the MEX transformation. It assumes that transforming the subarray into a sequence of integers from 0 to `i` is the correct approach, which is not aligned with the MEX operation.
   - The updates to the array are not aligned with the problem's requirements for maximizing the sum and constructing the sequence of operations.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX value.
   - The backtracking logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly reconstruct the sequence of operations.
   - The `make_stairs` function does not correctly transform the subarray into the desired MEX values.
   - The program does not meet the problem's requirements for maximizing the sum and constructing the sequence of operations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program contains logical errors in the computation of the MEX value and the construction of the sequence of operations, leading to incorrect results. The dynamic programming approach and the transformation logic in `make_stairs` are not aligned with the problem's requirements for the MEX operation.

Final: **False**
