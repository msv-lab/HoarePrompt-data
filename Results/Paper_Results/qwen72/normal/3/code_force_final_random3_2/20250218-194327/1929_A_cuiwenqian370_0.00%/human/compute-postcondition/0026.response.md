Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 3, `right` is `n - 4`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the single element `arr[2]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the elements `arr[2]` and `arr[n - 4]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `right` is decremented by 1, so it becomes `n - 4`.
- The value of `left` remains 3.
- The condition for `new_arr` is updated to check if `left` is equal to `right` (i.e., 3 == `n - 4`). If this condition is true, `new_arr` contains the single element `arr[2]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the elements `arr[2]` and `arr[n - 4]`.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
