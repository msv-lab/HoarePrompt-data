Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences between consecutive elements. One effective way to achieve this is to alternate between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The provided program does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
3. It calls the function `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.
4. The function `func_1`:
   - Sorts the array `arr`.
   - Constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array.
   - Computes the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

The construction of `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array is a valid approach to maximize the beauty of the array. The program correctly handles both even and odd lengths of the array, and the final output is the sum of the absolute differences, which is the required beauty.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
