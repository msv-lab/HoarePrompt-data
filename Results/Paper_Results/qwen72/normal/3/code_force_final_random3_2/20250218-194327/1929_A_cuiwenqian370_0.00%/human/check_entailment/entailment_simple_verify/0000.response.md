Reasoning:

The original assessment identifies a flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function, specifically in how it constructs the `new_arr` and calculates the beauty. However, there is a misunderstanding in the assessment regarding the calculation of the beauty. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This ensures that the smallest elements are at the beginning and the largest elements are at the end.

2. **Constructing `new_arr`**:
   - The program constructs `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from `arr`.
   - If `n` is odd, the middle element is appended last.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Let's consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
```
Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  - `arr` is sorted to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - `new_arr` is constructed as follows:
    - First iteration: `left = 0`, `right = 3` → `new_arr = [4, 1]`
    - Second iteration: `left = 1`, `right = 2` → `new_arr = [4, 1, 3, 2]`
  - The beauty is calculated as:
    - `abs(1 - 4) + abs(3 - 1) + abs(2 - 3) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`

The original assessment incorrectly states that the beauty is calculated as:
```
(1 - 4) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2
```

However, the program correctly uses the `abs` function to ensure that the differences are always positive, leading to the correct beauty calculation of 6.

Let's consider another test case to further validate the program:
```
Input:
1
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  - `arr` is sorted to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`.
  - `new_arr` is constructed as follows:
    - First iteration: `left = 0`, `right = 4` → `new_arr = [100, 43]`
    - Second iteration: `left = 1`, `right = 3` → `new_arr = [100, 43, 90, 54]`
    - Third iteration: `left = 2`, `right = 2` → `new_arr = [100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`
  - The beauty is calculated as:
    - `abs(43 - 100) + abs(90 - 43) + abs(54 - 90) + abs(80 - 54) = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166`

The program correctly follows the logic and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is actually correct in its approach to maximize the beauty of the array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements. The original assessment was incorrect in its calculation and reasoning.

Final: **True**
