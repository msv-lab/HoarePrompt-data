The code snippet `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])` updates the value of `max_beauty` by adding the absolute difference between the elements `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `i` is 1
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n
- `left` is `n`
- `right` is `-1`
- `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in the specified pattern
- `max_beauty` is 0

The code snippet will:
- Calculate the absolute difference between `new_arr[1]` and `new_arr[0]`
- Add this absolute difference to `max_beauty`

Since `new_arr` contains elements from `arr` in a specified pattern, and `arr` is sorted, the elements in `new_arr` are also sorted or follow a specific pattern. However, the exact pattern is not specified, so we will assume `new_arr` is a list of integers derived from `arr`.

Let's denote the elements of `new_arr` as `new_arr[0]` and `new_arr[1]`. The value of `max_beauty` will be updated to the absolute difference between these two elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in the specified pattern, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`**
