You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array where the beauty is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The array can be rearranged in any way to maximize this beauty.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It calls a function `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.
   - It stores the results and prints them after processing all test cases.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function sorts the array `arr`.
   - It creates a new array `new_arr` by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted array.
   - It calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Sorting and Alternating**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are at the ends.
   - By alternating elements from the ends to the middle, the function aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements, which in turn maximizes the beauty.

5. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.
   - This approach ensures that the largest possible differences are included in the sum, which is the goal of the problem.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case: \(a = [2, 1, 3]\). After sorting and alternating, the new array is \([3, 1, 2]\). The beauty is \((3 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 2\).
   - For the second test case: \(a = [69, 69, 69]\). After sorting and alternating, the new array is \([69, 69, 69]\). The beauty is \(0\).
   - For the third test case: \(a = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\). After sorting and alternating, the new array is \([100, 43, 90, 54, 80]\). The beauty is \((100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 43) + (90 - 80) = 57\).
   - For the fourth test case: \(a = [3, 4, 3, 3]\). After sorting and alternating, the new array is \([4, 3, 3, 3]\). The beauty is \((4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1\).
   - For the fifth test case: \(a = [2, 1]\). After sorting and alternating, the new array is \([2, 1]\). The beauty is \((2 - 1) = 1\).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by alternating the largest and smallest elements.
   - The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.
