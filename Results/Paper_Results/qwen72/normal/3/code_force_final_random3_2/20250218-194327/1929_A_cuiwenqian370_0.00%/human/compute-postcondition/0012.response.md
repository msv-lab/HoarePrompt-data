The value of `right` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `right` is `n - 1`, so after the decrement, `right` becomes `n - 2`. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `left` remain unchanged. The condition for `new_arr` also remains unchanged, but the value of `right` is now `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`.**
