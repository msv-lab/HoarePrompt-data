Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 2, `right` is `n - 3`, `new_arr` contains the values `arr[n - 3]` and `arr[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `arr[left]` (which is `arr[2]`) to `new_arr`. Since `new_arr` initially contained the value `arr[n - 3]`, after the code execution, `new_arr` now contains both `arr[n - 3]` and `arr[2]`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
