The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement that outputs the value of the variable `i` twice. According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly defined as 3.

Therefore, the `print(i, i)` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space and then the value of `i` again.

Output: **3 3**
