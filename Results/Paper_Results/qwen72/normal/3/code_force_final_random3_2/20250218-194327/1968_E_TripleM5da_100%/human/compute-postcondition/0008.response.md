The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5**
