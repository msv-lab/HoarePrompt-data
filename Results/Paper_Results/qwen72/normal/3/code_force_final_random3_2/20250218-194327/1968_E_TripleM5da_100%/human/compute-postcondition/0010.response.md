Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is `n`**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value between 1 and 50. The variable `n` is still the positive integer input by the user. The variable `i` will have the value of `n` because the loop iterates from 3 to `n` (inclusive), and after the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `n`.
