The loop head involves the variables `i` and the input value that defines the range for the loop. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `i` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be reset to 0, and the input value must be greater than `n` to ensure that the range includes the next value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be a positive integer, `i` is 0, the input value must be greater than `n`**
