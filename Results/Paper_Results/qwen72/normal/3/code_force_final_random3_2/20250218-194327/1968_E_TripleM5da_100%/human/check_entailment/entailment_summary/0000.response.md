Reasoning:
The program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program prints the following points for each test case:
- The first two points are always \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
- For the remaining points, it prints \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\).

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **First Two Points:**
   - The points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) are always printed.
   - The Manhattan distance between these two points is \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).

2. **Remaining Points:**
   - The program prints points \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\).
   - The Manhattan distance between any two points \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) is \(|i-j| + |i-j| = 2|i-j|\).

3. **Distinct Distances:**
   - The distances between the first two points and any of the remaining points \((i, i)\) are \(|1-i| + |1-i| = 2|i-1|\) and \(|1-i| + |2-i| = |1-i| + |i-2|\).
   - The distances between the first two points and the remaining points are distinct for different \(i\).
   - The distances between the remaining points \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) are \(2|i-j|\), which are also distinct for different \(i\) and \(j\).

4. **Maximizing the Size of \(\mathcal{H}\):**
   - The program ensures that the distances between the first two points and the remaining points are distinct.
   - The distances between the remaining points are also distinct and form a set of even numbers from 2 to \(2(n-2)\).
   - The total number of distinct distances is \(n-1\) (from 1 to \(2(n-2)\) plus the distance 0).

However, the program does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\). For example, for \(n=3\), the program prints:
- \((1, 1)\)
- \((1, 2)\)
- \((3, 3)\)

The distances are:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
- \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- \(|1-3| + |1-2| = 3\)
- \(|3-3| + |3-3| = 0\)

This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 4\}\), which has 4 distinct distances. However, the optimal solution for \(n=3\) should have 5 distinct distances, as shown in the example:
- \((2, 1)\)
- \((2, 3)\)
- \((3, 1)\)

The distances are:
- \(|2-2| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
- \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
- \(|2-3| + |1-3| = 3\)
- \(|3-3| + |1-1| = 0\)

This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has 4 distinct distances, but the optimal solution should have 5 distinct distances.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct solution to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
