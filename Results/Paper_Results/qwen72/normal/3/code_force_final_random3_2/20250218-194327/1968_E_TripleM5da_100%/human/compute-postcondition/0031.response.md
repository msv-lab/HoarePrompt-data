Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `i` is 5.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly defined as 5, the `print` statement will print the value of `i` twice.

Output: **5, 5**
