Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to select `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints a specific set of `n` cells.
   - The cells are printed as follows:
     - The first cell is always \((1, 1)\).
     - The second cell is always \((1, 2)\).
     - The remaining cells are \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to `n`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **First Cell (1, 1)**:
     - This cell is always at the top-left corner of the grid.
   - **Second Cell (1, 2)**:
     - This cell is always one step to the right of the first cell.
   - **Remaining Cells (i, i)**:
     - These cells are on the diagonal from \((3, 3)\) to \((n, n)\).

4. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**:
   - **Between (1, 1) and (1, 2)**:
     - The distance is \(|1 - 1| + |1 - 2| = 1\).
   - **Between (1, 1) and (i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to `n`**:
     - The distance is \(|1 - i| + |1 - i| = 2(i - 1)\).
   - **Between (1, 2) and (i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to `n`**:
     - The distance is \(|1 - i| + |2 - i| = 2(i - 1) - 1\).
   - **Between (i, i) and (j, j)\) for \(i\) and \(j\) from 3 to `n`**:
     - The distance is \(|i - j| + |i - j| = 2|i - j|\).

5. **Distinct Distances**:
   - The distances \(1, 2, 4, 6, \ldots, 2(n-1)\) are all distinct.
   - The distances \(1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots, 2(n-1) - 1\) are also distinct.
   - The distances \(2, 4, 6, \ldots, 2(n-2)\) are distinct.
   - Combining these, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all distinct distances from 0 to \(2(n-1)\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program generates a set of cells that ensures the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - The set of distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will have the maximum size, which is \(2(n-1) + 1\).

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
