Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints the minimum and maximum of these two integers. The logic used in the program is correct and matches the problem requirements. Here's a step-by-step verification:

1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   ```python
   x = int(input())
   ```
   This line reads the number of test cases, `t`, and assigns it to the variable `x`.

2. **Looping Through Each Test Case:**
   ```python
   for i in range(x):
   ```
   This loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case.

3. **Reading Two Integers for Each Test Case:**
   ```python
   (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   This line reads two space-separated integers and assigns them to `x` and `y`.

4. **Determining and Printing the Minimum and Maximum:**
   ```python
   if x < y:
       print(x, y)
   else:
       print(y, x)
   ```
   This conditional block checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. This ensures that the minimum of `x` and `y` is printed first, followed by the maximum.

The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
