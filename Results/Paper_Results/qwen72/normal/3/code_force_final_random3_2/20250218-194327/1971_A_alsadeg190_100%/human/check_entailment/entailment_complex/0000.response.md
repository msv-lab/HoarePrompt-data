Reasoning:  
The function `func` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It first reads an integer `t` (renamed to `x` in the function, which is a minor naming issue but does not affect correctness) that represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` and prints them in ascending order. The function handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for determining the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` is correct. The function does not need to return any value, as it directly prints the results, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

However, there is a minor naming inconsistency where the variable `t` (which represents the number of test cases) is named `x` in the function. This could lead to confusion, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

Given that the program meets the requirements and handles the inputs and outputs as specified, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
