Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of integers in the list, an integer `m` (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6) determining the winning condition, and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string that contains all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, followed by the string representation of the even-indexed elements in `rev_val` and the reversed form of the odd-indexed elements in `rev_val`. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the integer value of `rev_res` is less than or equal to 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing all reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, plus the concatenation of the even-indexed elements of `rev_val` in their integer form and the odd-indexed elements of `rev_val` in their reversed string form. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`, then the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`. Otherwise, the integer value of `rev_res` is less than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, `x` is the length of `rev_val` minus 1, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the processed elements from `rev_val` according to the loop's rules. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `10` is appended to `rev_res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
