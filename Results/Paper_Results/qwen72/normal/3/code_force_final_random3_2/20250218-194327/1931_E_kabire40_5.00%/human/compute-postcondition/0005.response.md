The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `operational_list`. For the loop to execute, `operational_list` must contain at least one element. The state of `x` will be the first element of `operational_list` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string and must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`**
