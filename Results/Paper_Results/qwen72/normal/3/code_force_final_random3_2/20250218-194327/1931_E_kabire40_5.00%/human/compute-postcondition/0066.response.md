Postcondition: ***`y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` has at least two string elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the second element of `operational_list` concatenated with itself, and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_res` is an empty string.***
