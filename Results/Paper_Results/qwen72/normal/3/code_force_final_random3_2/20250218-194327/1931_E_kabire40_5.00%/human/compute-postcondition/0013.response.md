Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string and must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the string `x` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` and `rev_res` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- `x_rev` is assigned the integer value of the reversed string of `x`.
- The length of the string representation of `x_rev` is compared to the length of `x`.
- If the lengths are equal, `rev_res` is set to the string `x`, and `rev_val` remains an empty list.
- If the lengths are not equal, `rev_val` is set to a list containing the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_res` remains an empty string.
- All other variables (`y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`) remain unchanged.
