Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` has at least three string elements, `x` is the third element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`.**

The code snippet `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` (which is the third element of `operational_list`) and converts it to an integer, assigning this new value to `x_rev`. All other variables remain unchanged.
