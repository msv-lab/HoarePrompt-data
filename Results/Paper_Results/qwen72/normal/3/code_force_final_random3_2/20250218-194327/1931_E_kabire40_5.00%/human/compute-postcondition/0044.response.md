Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string that contains all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, followed by the string representation of the even-indexed elements in `rev_val` and the reversed form of the odd-indexed elements in `rev_val`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `y` remains 0.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 is still true.
- The variables `list_len` and `max_power` remain unchanged as strings.
- The `operational_list` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
- The `rev_val` list is still a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string.
- The `rev_res` string is updated to include all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, followed by the string representation of the even-indexed elements in `rev_val` and the reversed form of the odd-indexed elements in `rev_val`.
