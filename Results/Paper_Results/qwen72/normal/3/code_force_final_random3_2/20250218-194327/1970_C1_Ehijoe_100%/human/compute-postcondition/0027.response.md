Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with at least three keys, `key` is the third key in `nodes`, `empty` remains `True`, and `ends` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `ends` is a list that now includes the second key in `nodes` and the third key in `nodes`.***
