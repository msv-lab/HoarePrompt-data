#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input through standard input, where the first line contains two integers n and t, with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t = 1. The next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v each, representing edges of the tree, with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. The last line contains a single integer u_1, representing the starting node, with 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list where each key (node) has a list of its connected nodes (edges), and each node `u` and `v` that were input during the loop execution are appended to each other's lists. `empty` remains `True` since it is not modified within the loop.
    ends = []
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            ends.append(key)
        
    #State: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with all keys processed, `empty` remains `True`, and `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node.

    while curr != e:

        if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
            prev = curr

    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [idx, n - idx - 1]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')

    #State: *`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of type list with all keys processed, `empty` remains `True`, `ends` is a list containing all keys from `nodes` that have exactly one connected node, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing all nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they were traversed, with `e` now appended to the end of the list, `prev` is the node immediately before `e` in the traversal, `curr` is equal to `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list, `moves` is a list containing two elements: `idx` and `n - idx - 1`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is an odd number, then the program follows the if part. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even, and the program follows the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a tree structure and a starting node from standard input. It identifies the two leaf nodes of the tree and constructs a list `tree` containing all nodes from one leaf to the other in the order they were traversed. The function then determines the distance from the starting node to the two leaf nodes and checks if either distance is odd. If at least one distance is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value.
