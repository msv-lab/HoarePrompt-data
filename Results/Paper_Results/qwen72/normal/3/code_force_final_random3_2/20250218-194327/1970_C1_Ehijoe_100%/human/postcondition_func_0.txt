The function `func_1` reads a tree structure and a starting node from standard input. It identifies the two leaf nodes of the tree and constructs a list `tree` containing all nodes from one leaf to the other in the order they were traversed. The function then determines the distance from the starting node to the two leaf nodes and checks if either distance is odd. If at least one distance is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value.
