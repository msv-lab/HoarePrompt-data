The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be decremented by 1, but it still needs to be greater than 0.

State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` is updated with a new element which is the last element of `ans` minus 1, `cnt` is now `cnt - 1`**
