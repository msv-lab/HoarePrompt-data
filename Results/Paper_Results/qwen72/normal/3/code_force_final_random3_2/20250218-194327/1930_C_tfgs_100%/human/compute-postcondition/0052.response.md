The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `adv`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j + 1` and `adv` is greater than `j + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 again, and `adv` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than `j + 2`, `ans` has a new element appended which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `j` is `j + 2`**
