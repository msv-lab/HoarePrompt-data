Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`, but the frequency of all elements in `a` is now 0, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing `n` integers, where the first `len(a)` elements are the elements of `a` in the same order, and the remaining elements are integers that fill the gaps between the elements of `a` such that all integers from 1 to the maximum element in `a` are represented in `ans`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, and its elements are not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be `len(a) - 1`, as the loop iterates over each index of the list `a`.
- **`counter`**: The `counter` object, which initially counted the frequency of each integer in `a`, will have the frequency of all elements in `a` reduced to 0, as each element in `a` is appended to `ans` and its count is decremented.
- **`cur`**: The variable `cur` will be 0 after all iterations, as it is incremented by the frequency of each element in `a` (which is 1 for each unique element) and then decremented by the same amount.
- **`cnt`**: The variable `cnt` will be 0 after all iterations, as it is initially `n - len(a)` and is decremented by the number of elements appended to `ans` to fill the gaps between the elements of `a`.
- **`ans`**: The list `ans` will contain `n` integers. The first `len(a)` elements of `ans` will be the elements of `a` in the same order. The remaining elements will be integers that fill the gaps between the elements of `a` such that all integers from 1 to the maximum element in `a` are represented in `ans`. This ensures that the list `ans` contains exactly `n` elements, with no duplicates and all integers from 1 to the maximum element in `a` included.
