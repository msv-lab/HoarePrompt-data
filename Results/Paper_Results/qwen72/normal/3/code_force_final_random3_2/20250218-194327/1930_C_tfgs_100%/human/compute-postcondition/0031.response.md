To determine which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - `i`: This is the loop index, which is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - `a`: This is the list being iterated over, and its length determines the number of iterations.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0 or greater.
   - `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order and must have at least 1 element.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - **`i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, if the current state is `i` is 0 or greater, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - **`a`**: The list `a` remains unchanged in the loop head. The length of `a` is used to determine the number of iterations, but the list itself is not modified in the loop head.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(a)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

### Adjusted State:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `a` remains the same, so `a` is still a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element.

### Final State:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and must have at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the updated list `a`, but the frequency of `a[i]` is now `counter[a[i]] - 1`, `cur` is `cur + counter[a[i]]` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cnt` remains `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each element is `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` in the range from 0 to `adv - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `ans` remains an empty list, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than or equal to 0 if `i` > 0, otherwise `adv` is not defined, `j` is `adv - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `j` is not defined, `ans` now contains one additional element `a[i]`.**
