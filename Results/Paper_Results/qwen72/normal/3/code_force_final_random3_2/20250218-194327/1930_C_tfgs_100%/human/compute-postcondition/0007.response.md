Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a[1]` is now `a[1] + 2`, `a[2]` is now `a[2] + 3`.** 

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[2]` by 3, since `i` is 2 and `i + 1` is 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
