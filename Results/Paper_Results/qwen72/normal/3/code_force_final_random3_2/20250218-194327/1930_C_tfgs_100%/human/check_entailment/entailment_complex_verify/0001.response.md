### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to perform operations on an array `a` to construct a set `S` and then generate the lexicographically largest array `b` from the sorted elements of `S` in descending order.
   - Each operation involves selecting an index `i`, inserting `a[i] + i` into `S`, and removing `a[i]` from `a`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using the function `func_1`.
   - In `func_1`:
     - It reads the length `n` of the array `a`.
     - It reads the elements of `a` and modifies each element by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]`.
     - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element.
     - It converts the modified array `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
     - It initializes `cnt` to the number of elements that were not unique in the modified array.
     - It constructs the array `ans` by:
       - For each unique element in `a`, it adds the element to `ans`.
       - It also adds elements that are just below the current element to `ans` to ensure the largest possible lexicographical order.
     - Finally, it prints the elements of `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Modification of `a`:** The program correctly modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element. This step is essential to simulate the operations described in the problem.
   - **Set Conversion and Sorting:** The program correctly converts the modified array `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. This ensures that the elements in `S` are unique and sorted.
   - **Handling Duplicates:** The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element. It then uses this information to fill in the gaps between unique elements in `ans` to maintain the largest possible lexicographical order. This is a crucial step to ensure that the final array `b` is as large as possible.
   - **Constructing `ans`:** The program constructs `ans` by adding the unique elements from `a` in descending order and filling in the gaps with the largest possible values that are not already in `ans`. This ensures that `ans` is lexicographically largest.
   - **Final Length of `ans`:** The program ensures that the final array `ans` is of the correct length `n` by appending the necessary elements to fill any remaining gaps.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Unique Elements:** If all elements in `a` are unique, the program correctly constructs `ans` with the modified elements in descending order.
   - **Duplicate Elements:** If all elements in `a` are the same, the program correctly handles the duplicates by filling in the gaps with the largest possible values.
   - **Single Element:** If `a` contains only one element, the program correctly constructs `ans` with the modified element.
   - **Large Input:** The program is designed to handle large inputs efficiently, as it uses set operations and sorting, which are typically `O(n log n)`.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the program is efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it involves sorting and set operations which are typically `O(n log n)`.
   - The space complexity is also reasonable, as it uses additional data structures like `Counter` and `set` to manage the elements.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` based on the problem description. It handles the operations and edge cases appropriately, ensuring that the final array `ans` is of the correct length and is sorted in descending order.

Final: **True**
