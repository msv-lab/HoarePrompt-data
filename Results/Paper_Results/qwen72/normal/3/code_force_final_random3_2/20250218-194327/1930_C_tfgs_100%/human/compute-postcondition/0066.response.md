The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than 0, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` is now `cnt - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `cnt` is increased by 1 to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`cnt` is now `cnt`, `ans` has a new element which is the last element of `ans` minus 1.**
