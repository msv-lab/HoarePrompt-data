Postcondition: ***`card` is the third element of the list returned by `input().split()`, `input().split()` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where n is an integer and 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list that includes a string formed by joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` appended to each, separated by a space, and `suits[suit]` is `None`. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is equal to `rank`.***
