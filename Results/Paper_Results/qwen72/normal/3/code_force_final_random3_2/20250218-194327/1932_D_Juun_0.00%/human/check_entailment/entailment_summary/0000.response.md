Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by separating trump cards from non-trump cards and then pairing them according to the rules. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the input for the number of rounds `n`. The `input()` call inside `func_1` should be `n = int(input())` to read the number of rounds.

2. **Pairing Non-Trump Cards**: The program attempts to pair non-trump cards with the same suit by sorting and then pairing them. However, it only pairs one card at a time and does not handle the case where there are more than two cards of the same suit.

3. **Pairing Trump Cards**: The program pairs trump cards with non-trump cards if there are any remaining non-trump cards. However, it does not ensure that the trump card is of a higher rank than the non-trump card, which is a requirement for a trump card to beat a non-trump card.

4. **Final Trump Pairing**: The program pairs remaining trump cards among themselves, but it does not check if the pairs are valid (i.e., the first card has a higher rank than the second).

5. **Output Order**: The program does not guarantee that the output pairs are in the correct order, as required by the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program may not always produce a valid sequence of rounds, and in some cases, it may incorrectly print "IMPOSSIBLE" or produce invalid pairs.

Correctness: **False**
