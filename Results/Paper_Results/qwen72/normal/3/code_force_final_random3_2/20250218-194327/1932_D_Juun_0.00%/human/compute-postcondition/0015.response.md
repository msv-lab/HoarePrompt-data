Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `user_input` is the user's input as a string, `trump` is the user's input as a string, `trumps` is an empty list, `card` is the first element of the list returned by `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`, and `suit` is not equal to `trump`. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, then `answers` is a list containing one string, which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, each followed by `suit`, and the value of `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list, and the value of `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.***
