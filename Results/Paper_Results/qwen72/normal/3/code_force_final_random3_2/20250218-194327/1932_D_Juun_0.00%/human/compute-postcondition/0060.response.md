Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16.
- `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS".
- `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS".
- `user_input` is the user's input as a string.
- `trump` is the user's input as a string, which should be a valid suit from "CDHS".
- `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be set to a non-`None` value.
- `trumps` is a sorted list in ascending order and must contain at least one element.
- `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the sorted ranks of pairs of cards from `user_input` that have the same suit but are not the trump suit, and each string is in the format 'rank suit trumps.pop() trump' for each non-None rank in `suits` that had a corresponding trump card.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`trumps` List**: This list is sorted in ascending order and contains at least one element. Since it is sorted, the elements are in increasing order of their ranks (e.g., ['2', '3', '4', ...]).
2. **`trump` Variable**: This is the user's input, which is a valid suit from "CDHS".
3. **`trumps.pop()`**: This method removes and returns the last element of the `trumps` list. Since `trumps` is sorted in ascending order, the last element will be the highest rank in the list.
4. **First `trumps.pop()` Call**: The highest rank in the `trumps` list will be removed and returned.
5. **Second `trumps.pop()` Call**: The second highest rank in the `trumps` list will be removed and returned.
6. **String Formatting**: The `print` statement will format the output as follows:
   - The first `trumps.pop()` result will be concatenated with `trump`.
   - The second `trumps.pop()` result will be concatenated with `trump`.
   - These two concatenated strings will be separated by a space.

### Example Scenario:
- Suppose `trumps` is `['2', '3', '4', '5']` and `trump` is 'H'.
- The first `trumps.pop()` will return '5', and the second `trumps.pop()` will return '4'.
- The output will be `5H 4H`.

### General Case:
- The output will be the two highest ranks from the `trumps` list, each concatenated with the `trump` suit, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **[highest_rank]H [second_highest_rank]H (where [highest_rank] and [second_highest_rank] are the two highest ranks in the `trumps` list, and H is the `trump` suit)**

Note: Replace 'H' with the actual `trump` suit provided by the user. The ranks will be the two highest ranks in the `trumps` list.
