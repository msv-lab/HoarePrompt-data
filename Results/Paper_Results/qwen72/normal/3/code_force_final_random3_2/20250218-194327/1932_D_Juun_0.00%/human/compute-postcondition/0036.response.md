Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `user_input` is the user's input as a string, `trump` is the user's input as a string, `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards from `user_input` whose suit matches `trump`, `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the sorted ranks of pairs of cards from `user_input` that have the same suit but are not the trump suit, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be set to a non-`None` value, and the current value of `rank` is `None`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
