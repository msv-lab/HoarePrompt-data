The `input()` function is called, which waits for user input and then returns that input as a string. Since the initial state does not specify what the user inputs, the output state will include the fact that a new variable (let's call it `user_input`) now holds the value of the user's input. The other variables (`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `user_input` is the user's input as a string.**
