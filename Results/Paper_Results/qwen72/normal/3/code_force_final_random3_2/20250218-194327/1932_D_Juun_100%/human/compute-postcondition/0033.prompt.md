Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds played in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains a trump suit (one of "CDHS") and a list of 2n[i] unique card descriptions (each card description is a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the card, which is one of "23456789", and the second one is the suit of the card, which is one of "CDHS"). The variable `trump` is assigned the value of the input provided, which is a string representing one of the suits "CDHS". The list `trumps` is initialized as an empty list. `answers` is an empty list. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all initially set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`card` is the first card description in the list generated by `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list that includes `rank` as its first element. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, and `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` now contains a string that is the concatenation of `suit` and `rank` or `suits[suit]` and `rank`, sorted alphabetically, separated by a space. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`card` is the second card description in the list generated by `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list that includes `rank` as its last element. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list that now contains an additional string which is the concatenation of the sorted `rank` and `suits[suit]` with `suit` appended to each, and `suits[suit]` is now `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits[suit]` is now equal to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`card` is the third card description in the list generated by `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. The list generated by `input().split()` must have at least 3 elements. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list that now includes `rank`. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list that now contains one additional element, which is a string formed by joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` appended to each, separated by a space, and `suits[suit]` is `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits[suit]` is now equal to `rank`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
