Postcondition: ***`suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit, and `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`. `rank` is the rank of the next suit in the dictionary that is not `None`, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, and `answers` is a list that has been appended with a string in the format `'None{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`. If `rank` is `None`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.***
