Postcondition: ***`suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit, and `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`. `suit` is the next suit in the dictionary, `rank` is the value associated with that suit in the dictionary. If `rank` is `None`, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, and `answers` is a list that has been appended with a string in the format `'None{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`. Otherwise, the values of `suits`, `suit`, `rank`, `trumps`, and `answers` remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
