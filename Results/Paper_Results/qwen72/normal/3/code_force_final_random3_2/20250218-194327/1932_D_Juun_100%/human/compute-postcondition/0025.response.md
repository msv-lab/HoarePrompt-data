The only objects in the loop head are the variable `card` and the list generated by `input().split()`. Therefore, we can only adjust these objects. 

At the end of the last iteration, `card` was the second card description in the list generated by `input().split()`. For the next iteration, `card` will be the third card description in the list. The list generated by `input().split()` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`card` is the third card description in the list generated by `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list that includes `rank` as its last element. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list that now contains an additional string which is the concatenation of the sorted `rank` and `suits[suit]` with `suit` appended to each, and `suits[suit]` is now `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits[suit]` is now equal to `rank`. The list generated by `input().split()` must have at least 3 elements.**
