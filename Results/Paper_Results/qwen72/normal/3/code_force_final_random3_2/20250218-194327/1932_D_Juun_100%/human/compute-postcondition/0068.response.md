The only object in the loop head is the variable `answer` and the list `answers`. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `answers` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `answers` is a list containing at least one string in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more such string in `answers`.

State: **`trumps` is a list with at least one element for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, `answers` is a list containing at least two strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each such suit, `suits` remains unchanged**
