Postcondition: ***`card` is the second card description in the list generated by `input().split()`, `rank` is the first character of `card`, `suit` is the second character of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list that includes `rank` as its last element. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list that now contains an additional string which is the concatenation of the sorted `rank` and `suits[suit]` with `suit` appended to each, and `suits[suit]` is now `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits[suit]` is now equal to `rank`.***
