The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `trumps` is not an empty list. At the end of the last iteration, `trumps` is a sorted list in descending order containing at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `trumps` must still be a non-empty list.

State: **`suits` will still be a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit. `trumps` will now be a sorted list in descending order, containing at least one element. `answers` will still be a list containing strings in the format `'rank{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-`None` rank, where `{suit}` is the suit and `{popped_trump}` is the corresponding rank from the `trumps` list. If `trumps` was not long enough to match all non-`None` ranks in `suits`, the loop will have printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned early.**
