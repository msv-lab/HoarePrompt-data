Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary where each key (suit) is either `None` or the rank of the last card of that suit encountered that did not form a pair with a previously seen card of the same suit, and `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`. `rank` is the rank of the next suit in the dictionary that is not `None`, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, and `answers` is a list that has been appended with a string in the format `'None{suit} {popped_trump}{trump}'`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: The `continue` statement does not change the values of `suits`, `rank`, `trumps`, or `answers`. However, it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same as described in the initial state.
