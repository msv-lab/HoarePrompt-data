The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `c`, `q`, and a list of queries. `c` is a list of positive integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), and the list of queries is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The function processes these queries and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a query and represents some computation or property of the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `c` of positive integers, a non-negative integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list of queries, each query being a tuple of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a query and is based on some computation or property of the sublist `c[l_i-1:r_i]`.**
