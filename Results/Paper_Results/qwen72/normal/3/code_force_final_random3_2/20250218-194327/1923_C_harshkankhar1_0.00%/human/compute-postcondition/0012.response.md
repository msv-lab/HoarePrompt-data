Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer, as it was in the initial state.
- The loop index `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
- The list `b` has been updated such that each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of the values of `x` from the first iteration up to the current iteration. The value of `x` for each iteration is determined by whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 (in which case `x` is 1) or not (in which case `x` is 2). Therefore, `b[i]` represents the sum of these `x` values up to the `i`-th position in the list `a`.
