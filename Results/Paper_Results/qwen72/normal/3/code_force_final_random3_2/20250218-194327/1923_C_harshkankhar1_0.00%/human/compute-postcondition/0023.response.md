Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `a` is a list of cumulative sums of the original `a` list, `q` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are input integers, and 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet evaluates the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.
- If the condition is true, 'NO' is printed.
- If the condition is false, 'YES' is printed.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `b[i]`, `a`, `q`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The output state includes the initial state information and the result of the print statement based on the evaluated condition.
