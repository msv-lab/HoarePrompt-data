The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `q`. The loop can execute again if `q` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, `a` is a list of cumulative sums of the original `a` list, `q` is greater than 1, and 'NO' is printed if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise 'YES' is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, and `q` must be greater than 1 (since `q` is the number of iterations left, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue). However, since `_` is not used in the loop head, it does not need to be explicitly mentioned in the state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i = 1` to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `a` is a list of cumulative sums of the original `a` list, `q` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are input integers, and 'NO' is printed if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise 'YES' is printed.**
