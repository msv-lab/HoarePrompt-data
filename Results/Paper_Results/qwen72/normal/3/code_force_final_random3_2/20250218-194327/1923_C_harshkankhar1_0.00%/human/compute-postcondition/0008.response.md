Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 2), `i` is 2, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`**

Explanation: The code snippet `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x` updates the value of `b[2]` based on the values of `b[1]` and `x`. Since `i` is 2, `b[2]` is set to `b[1] + x`. The value of `x` is determined by whether `a[2]` is greater than 1 (1 if true, 2 if false). The value of `b[1]` is already `b[0] + x` from the initial state. Therefore, `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`, which simplifies to `b[0] + x + x` or `b[0] + 2*x`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
