Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 0, and `possible` is True. Additionally, the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
