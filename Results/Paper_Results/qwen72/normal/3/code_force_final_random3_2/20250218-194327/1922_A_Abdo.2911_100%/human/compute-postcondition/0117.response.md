Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 1. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] == a[i]`, `possible` retains its initial value. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or if statement. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
