Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 1, `possible` is False if the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b` and the first character of `c` is equal to either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b`, otherwise `possible` is True, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or if statement.**
