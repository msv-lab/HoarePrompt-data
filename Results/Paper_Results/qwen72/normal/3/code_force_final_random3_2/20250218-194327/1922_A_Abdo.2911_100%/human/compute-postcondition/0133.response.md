Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is the last input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is the last input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n - 1`, and `possible` is True if at any point during the last iteration of the loop, either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is False.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the loop variable `_` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last test case, with `a`, `b`, and `c` being the last input strings with any leading or trailing whitespace removed. The variable `i` will be `n - 1`, which is the index of the last character in the string `a` (or `b` or `c`). The variable `possible` will be True if, during the last iteration, the loop found a character position `i` where either `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same but `c[i]` is different, or `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and `c[i]` is different from both of them. If no such position was found, `possible` will be False.
