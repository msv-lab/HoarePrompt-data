### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The function initializes a variable `possible` to `False` to track whether a valid template exists.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the template at position `i` must be an uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]` since they are the same). The function checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). If it is, then `c` does not match the template, and `possible` is set to `True`.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the template at position `i` can be either an uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`. The function checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If it is, then `c` does not match the template, and `possible` is set to `True`.
     - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]` when `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the function continues to the next position because `c` might still match the template at other positions.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES" indicating that a valid template exists.
   - If `possible` is `False`, the function prints "NO" indicating that no valid template exists.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be an uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). For `c` to not match, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). This is correctly handled by the condition `if c[i] != a[i]`.

- **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be an uppercase version of either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. For `c` to not match, `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is correctly handled by the condition `elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]`.

- **Case 3: `c[i]` matches neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`**
  - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then a valid template can be constructed, and `possible` is set to `True`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions and the flow of the program are consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
