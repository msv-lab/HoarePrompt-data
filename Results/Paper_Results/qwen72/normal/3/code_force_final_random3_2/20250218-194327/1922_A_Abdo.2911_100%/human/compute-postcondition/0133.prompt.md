Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take four parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. `t` is now an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    possible = False
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if c[i] != a[i]:
                possible = True
                break
        elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
            continue
        else:
            possible = True
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n - 1`, and `possible` is either True or False depending on the conditions encountered during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n - 1`, and `possible` is True if at any point during the loop, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, or if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `possible` is True, it indicates that at some point during the loop, either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `possible` is False, it means that at no point during the loop did either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
