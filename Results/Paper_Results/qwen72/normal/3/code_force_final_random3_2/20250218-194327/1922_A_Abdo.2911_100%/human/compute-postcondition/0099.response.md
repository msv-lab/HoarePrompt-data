Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 0, `possible` is True, the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a`, and the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
