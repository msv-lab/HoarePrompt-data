The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Since `t` is an input integer and it is specified that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, we need to ensure that `t` is within this range. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, which starts at 0 and increments with each iteration.

State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0**
