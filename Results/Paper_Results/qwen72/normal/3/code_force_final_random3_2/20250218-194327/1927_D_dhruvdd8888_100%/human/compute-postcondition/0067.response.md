Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
   - The third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is ignored.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
   - The values of `s` and `e` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The values of `l` and `r` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The value of `eli` is not used in the `print` statement.
   - The value of `LA` is not used in the `print` statement.
   - The third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is not used in the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, or `LA`.

Output: **-1, -1**
