### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It appends `-1` to the array `nums` to handle edge cases. This is a good approach to ensure that the loop always ends with a transition to a different number.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It iterates through the array to group consecutive equal elements into a list `arr` of tuples, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the number of the group. This is done correctly.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it reads the query boundaries `l` and `r`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index of the group is just greater than or equal to `l`.
   - It retrieves the start and end indices of the group at `eli` or the last group if `eli` is out of bounds.

4. **Conditions for Valid Pairs:**
   - **Condition 1:** `if s > l:`
     - This checks if the start index of the current group is greater than `l`.
     - If `s == 1` or `s > r`, it prints `-1 -1` because the start index is either at the beginning of the array or outside the query range.
     - Otherwise, it prints `s - 1` and `s`, which are the indices of the last element of the previous group and the first element of the current group. This is correct because these indices will always be different and within the query range.
   - **Condition 2:** `elif e >= r:`
     - This checks if the end index of the current group is greater than or equal to `r`.
     - If true, it prints `-1 -1` because the group extends beyond the query range, and no valid pair exists.
   - **Condition 3:** `elif e < N or e < l:`
     - This checks if the end index of the current group is less than `N` or less than `l`.
     - If true, it prints `s` and `e + 1`, which are the indices of the first element of the current group and the first element of the next group. This is correct because these indices will always be different and within the query range.
   - **Condition 4:** `else:`
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1` because the group is entirely within the query range and all elements are the same, so no valid pair exists.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the query range is entirely within a single group of equal elements correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the query range spans multiple groups correctly.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to efficiently find the start of the group, which is `O(log N)` per query.
   - The overall complexity is `O(N + Q log N)`, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func_1` is called without passing any parameters. This is a minor issue because the function should ideally take parameters for better readability and modularity. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program as it reads the input directly within the function.
- **State: `i` is `N + 1`, `num` is the last element in `nums` (which is `-1`), `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, and `s` is `N`:**
  - The state is correct. The loop has processed all elements of `nums`, and `arr` contains the correct ranges of consecutive equal elements.
- **State: The loop will have executed `int(input())` times, and for each iteration, the values of `l` and `r` will have been provided by the user input. The values of `s` and `e` will be determined by the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, where `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The state of `arr`, `N`, and `LA` will remain unchanged. The loop will print a pair of integers based on the conditions described in the loop body, and these conditions will be evaluated for each pair of `l` and `r` provided:**
  - The state and the loop behavior are correctly described. The conditions within the loop are logically sound and handle all possible cases for the query range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct and handles the problem as described. It correctly groups consecutive equal elements and efficiently checks for valid pairs within the query range. The original assessment was accurate.
