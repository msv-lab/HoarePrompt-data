### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It appends `-1` to the array `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It iterates through the array to group consecutive equal elements into a list `arr` of tuples, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the number of the group.
   - For each query, it reads the query boundaries `l` and `r`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index of the group is just greater than or equal to `l`.
   - It retrieves the start and end indices of the group at `eli` or the last group if `eli` is out of bounds.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists within the query range:
     - If the start index of the group is greater than `l` and the start index is not 1 and not greater than `r`, it prints the indices `s-1` and `s`.
     - If the end index of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1`.
     - If the end index of the group is less than `N` or less than `l`, it prints the indices `s` and `e+1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly groups consecutive equal elements in the array.
   - The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate to find the start of the group that might contain the query range.
   - The conditions to check if a valid pair exists within the query range are logically sound:
     - If the start index of the group is greater than `l` and not 1 or greater than `r`, it means there is a valid pair just before the start of the group.
     - If the end index of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, it means the group extends beyond the query range, and no valid pair exists.
     - If the end index of the group is less than `N` or less than `l`, it means there is a valid pair just after the end of the group.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it means the group is entirely within the query range and all elements are the same, so no valid pair exists.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the query range is entirely within a single group of equal elements.
   - The program also handles the case where the query range spans multiple groups.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to efficiently find the start of the group, which is `O(log N)` per query.
   - The overall complexity is `O(N + Q log N)`, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct and handles the problem as described. It correctly groups consecutive equal elements and efficiently checks for valid pairs within the query range.

Correctness: **True**
