The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is at least 0, because `range(N + 1)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `N` inclusive. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the `range` function.

State: **`i` is 0, `N` must be greater than or equal to 0**
