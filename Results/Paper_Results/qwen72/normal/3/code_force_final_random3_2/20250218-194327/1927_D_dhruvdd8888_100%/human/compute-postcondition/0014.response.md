The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `N + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `N + 1`.

State: **`i` is 1, `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is equal to `nums[0]`, if `nums[0]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` contains a new tuple `(1, 0, num)` at the end, and `s` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr` or `s`.**
