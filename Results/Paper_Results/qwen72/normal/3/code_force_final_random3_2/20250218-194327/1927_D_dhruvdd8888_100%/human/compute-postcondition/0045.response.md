Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `s` is less than or equal to `l`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the current value of `e` is greater than or equal to `r`. Otherwise, if `e` is less than `r`, the current value of `e` is less than `r`. Additionally, if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, the current value of `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`. Otherwise, `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.***
