Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. If `s` > `l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`, or `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is less than or equal to `r`. If `s` â‰¤ `l`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, or `e` is less than `r`. Additionally, if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, then `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`. Otherwise, `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` updates the value of `eli` to the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
- The initial state conditions for `int(input())`, `l`, `r`, `s`, and `e` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `eli` is determined based on the sorted order of `arr` and the tuple `(l, 0, 0)`.
- The conditions for `s` and `e` are still valid and depend on the new value of `eli` and the elements in `arr`.
