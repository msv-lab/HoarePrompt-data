The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a tuple of two integers `(l, r)`. The list `a` contains integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and the length of `a` is 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each query `(l, r)` satisfies 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The number of test cases `t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the total number of queries across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results corresponding to each query in `q`. For each query `(l, r)`, the function returns the result of some operation performed on the sublist `a[l:r+1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of `a`, and a list of queries `q`. Each query in `q` is a tuple `(l, r)` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the outcome of an operation performed on the sublist `a[l:r+1]` for each query.**
