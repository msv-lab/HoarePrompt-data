Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. If `s` > `l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`, or `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is less than or equal to `r`. If `s` â‰¤ `l`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, or `e` is less than `r`. Additionally, if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, then `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`. Otherwise, `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` updates the value of `eli` to the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
- The values of `l` and `r` remain the same as they are provided by user input.
- The value of `int(input())` must still be greater than 0.
- The values of `s` and `e` are still determined by the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- All the conditions regarding `s` and `e` remain valid as they are based on the updated value of `eli`.
