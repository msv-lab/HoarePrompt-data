Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order.
   - The third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is ignored.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement explicitly prints the values `-1` and `-1`.
   - The values of `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, and `LA` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the `print` statement will always output `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, and `LA`.

Output: **-1, -1**
