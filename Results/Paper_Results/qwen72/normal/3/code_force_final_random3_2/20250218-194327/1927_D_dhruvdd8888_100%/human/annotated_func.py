#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a tuple of two integers `(l, r)`. The list `a` contains integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and the length of `a` is 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each query `(l, r)` satisfies 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The number of test cases `t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the total number of queries across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `i` is `N + 1`, `num` is the last element in `nums` (which is `-1`), `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, and `s` is `N`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `int(input())` times, and for each iteration, the values of `l` and `r` will have been provided by the user input. The values of `s` and `e` will be determined by the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, where `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The state of `arr`, `N`, and `LA` will remain unchanged. The loop will print a pair of integers based on the conditions described in the loop body, and these conditions will be evaluated for each pair of `l` and `r` provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a list of integers and processes a series of queries. Each query is a tuple `(l, r)` representing a range within the list. The function outputs a pair of integers for each query, indicating the boundaries of a segment where the segment can be split into two parts such that the first part is strictly less than the second part. If no such segment exists within the query range, it outputs `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it directly prints the results of the queries. The state of the input list and the queries remains unchanged after the function execution.
