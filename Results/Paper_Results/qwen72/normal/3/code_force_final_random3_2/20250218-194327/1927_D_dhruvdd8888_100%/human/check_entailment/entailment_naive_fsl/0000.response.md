Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i \ne a_j` within the given range `[l, r]` is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 2 3 3
3
1 5
2 4
3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1 2
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

The program fails to find valid pairs for the queries `(2, 4)` and `(3, 5)` because it does not correctly handle the case where the range `[l, r]` contains multiple different elements. The logic for checking the range and finding the indices is not robust enough to cover all possible scenarios.
