Output State: **`i` is 2, `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `num` is equal to `nums[2]`. If `nums[1]` is not equal to `nums[0]`, `arr` contains a new tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])` at the end and `s` is 1. If `nums[2]` is not equal to `nums[1]`, `arr` contains a new tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])` at the end, and `s` is now 2. If `nums[2]` is equal to `nums[1]`, `arr` and `s` remain unchanged.**
