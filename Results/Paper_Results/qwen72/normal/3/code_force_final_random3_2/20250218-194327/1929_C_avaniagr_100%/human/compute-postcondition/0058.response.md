Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer in the fourth line of the file, `x` is the second integer in the fourth line of the file, `a` is the third integer in the fourth line of the file, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 4 lines, and `s` is the fourth line of the file. If `a` >= `x` + 1, then the program continues with the variables retaining their values. Otherwise, the program continues with the variables retaining their values.**
