Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100 and x is greater than or equal to k, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines, and `s` is the second line of the file. After all iterations, `i` is `x - k + 2`, `z` is updated to `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.**
