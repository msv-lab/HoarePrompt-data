Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer in the third line of the file, `x` is the second integer in the third line of the file, `a` is the third integer in the third line of the file, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 3 lines, and `s` is the third line of the file. If `a` >= `x` + 2, the program does not modify any variables. Otherwise, the program does not modify any variables.***
