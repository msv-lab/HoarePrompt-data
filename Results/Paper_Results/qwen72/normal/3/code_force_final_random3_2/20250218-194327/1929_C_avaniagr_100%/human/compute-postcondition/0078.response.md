The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `k`, `x`, and `a`. The function is expected to process these parameters and return a result for each test case. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.

The function likely processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9), and returns a result for each test case.**
