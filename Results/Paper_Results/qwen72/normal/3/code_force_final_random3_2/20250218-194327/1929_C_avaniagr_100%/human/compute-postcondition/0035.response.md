Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer in the third line of the file, `x` is the second integer in the third line of the file, `a` is the third integer in the third line of the file, the file opened by `open(0)` must have at least 3 lines, and `s` is the third line of the file. If `a` >= `x` + 1, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part.*** 

Note: Since the postconditions for both the if and else parts are identical and no specific changes are made to the variables within these parts, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
