You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, k, x, and a are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9. The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least `t + 1` lines. For each line `s` from the second to the `t + 1`-th line, `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers read from that line. If `x < k - 1`, then the output is 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, otherwise 'NO'. If `x == k - 1`, then the output is 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, otherwise 'NO'. If `x > k - 1`, then `z` is updated by the nested loop to `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`, and the output is 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9), and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
