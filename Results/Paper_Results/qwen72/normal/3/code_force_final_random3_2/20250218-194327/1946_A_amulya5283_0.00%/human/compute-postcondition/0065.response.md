Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the values of `operations` and the final value of `operations` appended, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is now a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, with all elements that were less than or equal to `current_median` increased by 1 until the smallest element in the heap is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of times the smallest element in the heap was increased by 1 to make `heap[0]` greater than `current_median`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `operations` will contain the total number of times the smallest element in the heap was incremented by 1 until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the `current_median`. The heap will still be a min-heap, but all elements that were initially less than or equal to `current_median` will have been incremented until the smallest element in the heap is greater than `current_median`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median`) will remain unchanged from their initial values.
