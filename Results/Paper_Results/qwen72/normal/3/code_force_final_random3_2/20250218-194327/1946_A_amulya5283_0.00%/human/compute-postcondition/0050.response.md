Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the values of `operations` and the new value of `operations` appended, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end and is not yet a min-heap, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

Explanation:
- The code `heap = arr[median_index:]` slices the list `arr` starting from the index `median_index` to the end and assigns this slice to the variable `heap`.
- The value of `heap` is now a list containing the elements of `arr` from the index `median_index` to the end.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `operations`) remain unchanged.
- The state of `heap` being not yet a min-heap is still valid.
- The initial conditions and the values of the other variables are still in effect.
