Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array length is even. According to the problem description, the median for an even-length array is the element at index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\), which is \(n // 2\) in Python (since Python uses 0-based indexing). However, the program only considers the second half of the array starting from the median index, and it does not account for the element just before the median index. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The median of the original array is 2 (since the sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4] and the element at index \(\lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2\) is 3). To increase the median, we need to increase the element at index 1 (which is 2) to 3. This requires 1 operation. However, the program will incorrectly return 2 operations because it only considers the elements from index 2 onwards.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
