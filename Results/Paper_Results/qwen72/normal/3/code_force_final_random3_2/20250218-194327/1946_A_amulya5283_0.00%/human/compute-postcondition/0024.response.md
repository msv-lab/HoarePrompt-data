Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n, arr = test_cases[i]` reassigns the values of `n` and `arr` to the first and second elements of `test_cases[1]`, respectively.
- Since `i` is 1, `n` and `arr` are updated to the values at the index 1 of `test_cases`.
- The other variables (`t`, `results`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states.
