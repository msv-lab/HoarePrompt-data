Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the values of `operations` and the new value of `operations` appended, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is now a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, except the smallest element which has been removed and the next smallest element which is now the smallest, `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before the current operation, `operations` is 2, and the smallest element in the heap has been increased by 1, and `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`. The value `smallest + 1` has been pushed into the heap, and `heap[0]` is now the smallest element in the heap, which is either the previously next smallest element or `smallest + 1` if it is smaller.**
