Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, and `results` is an empty list.
- The code `n, arr = test_cases[i]` unpacks the tuple at index `i` of `test_cases` into the variables `n` and `arr`.
- Since `i` is 0, `n` is assigned the first element of `test_cases[0]`, and `arr` is assigned the second element of `test_cases[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, and `results` remain unchanged.
- The output state reflects the updated values of `n` and `arr` while keeping the initial values of `t`, `i`, and `results` intact.
