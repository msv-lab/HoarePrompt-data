Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` + 2 to the end, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the element at `arr[median_index + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the min-heap `heap`.
- The min-heap `heap` initially contains elements from `arr` starting from `median_index + 1` to the end.
- After popping the smallest element, `heap` now contains elements starting from `median_index + 2` to the end.
- The variable `smallest` is updated to the value of the element at `arr[median_index + 1]`.
- All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
