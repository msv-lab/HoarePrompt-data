Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the values of `operations` and the new value of `operations` appended, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end and is now a min-heap with the smallest element being greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**
