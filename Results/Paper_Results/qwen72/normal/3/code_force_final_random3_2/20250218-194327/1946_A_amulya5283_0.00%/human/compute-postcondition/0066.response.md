Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the values of `operations` and the final value of `operations` appended, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is now a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, with all elements that were less than or equal to `current_median` increased by 1 until the smallest element in the heap is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of times the smallest element in the heap was increased by 1 to make `heap[0]` greater than `current_median`.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append(operations)` appends the value of `operations` to the list `results`.
- The value of `operations` is the total number of times the smallest element in the heap was increased by 1 to make `heap[0]` greater than `current_median`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, and `heap`) remain unchanged.
- The list `results` now contains the values of `operations` and the final value of `operations` appended.
