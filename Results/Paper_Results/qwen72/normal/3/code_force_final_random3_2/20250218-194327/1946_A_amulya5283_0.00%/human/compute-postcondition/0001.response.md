The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `results` is an empty list. The variable `i` is not initialized before the loop, but it will be set to 0 by the `range(t)` function at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
