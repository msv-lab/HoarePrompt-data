The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a heap, in-place, in linear time. This means that the elements of `heap` will be rearranged to satisfy the heap property, where the parent node is less than or equal to its children for a min-heap. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, and `operations`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a list containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end and is now a min-heap, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**
