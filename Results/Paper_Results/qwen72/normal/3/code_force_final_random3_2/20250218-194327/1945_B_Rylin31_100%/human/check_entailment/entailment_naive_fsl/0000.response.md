Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The formula used in the program, `m // a + m // b + 2`, does not account for the correct overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by the two installations.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6 7 4
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program will output `4`, which is incorrect. The program incorrectly adds 2 to the result without considering the actual visibility overlap.

The correct approach should involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap of the launch times and then correctly count the number of fireworks visible at the same time.
