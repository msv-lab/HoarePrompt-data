The function `func` is described with parameter constraints but no parameters are explicitly listed in the function signature. However, based on the provided constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including `t` (the number of test cases) and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` (all integers). The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers within the range 1 to 10^18.

Given these constraints, the function is expected to process these inputs and produce an output. However, the output description is missing. To accurately describe the functionality, I will assume a common scenario for such parameters, which is often related to modular arithmetic or some form of computation involving `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case, but the specific output for each case is not provided.**
