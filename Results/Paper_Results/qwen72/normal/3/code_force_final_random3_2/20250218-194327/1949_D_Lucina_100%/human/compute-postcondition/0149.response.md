Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `nx` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx = ''` reassigns the variable `nx` to an empty string. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `nx` and retains the initial values of `i` and `n`.
