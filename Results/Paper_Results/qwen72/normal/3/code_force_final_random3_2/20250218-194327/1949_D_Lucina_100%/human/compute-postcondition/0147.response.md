To determine what will be printed by the `print(nx)` statement, we need to understand how the string `nx` is constructed based on the given initial state.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
- `nx` is a string that is constructed based on the following rules:
  - It contains the characters from `xx[1]` (excluding any '?').
  - For positions where `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` and the corresponding character in `xx[1]` is '?', the character in `nx` is 'F'.
  - For positions where the corresponding character in `xx[1]` is '?' and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, the character in `nx` is 'S'.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `sa` and `xx[1]`:**
   - `sa` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a list of some kind.
   - `xx[1]` is a string, and we need to consider its characters, especially the '?' characters.

2. **Constructing `nx`:**
   - For each character in `xx[1]`, we check if it is a '?'.
   - If the character is not a '?', it is directly included in `nx`.
   - If the character is a '?', we need to determine if the position `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.
     - If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, the character in `nx` is 'F'.
     - Otherwise, the character in `nx` is 'S'.

3. **Example Construction:**
   - Let's assume `xx[1]` is "A?B?C?D".
   - Let's assume `sa` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
   - Let's assume `n` is 12.

   - `n // 4 - 1` is \(12 // 4 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\).
   - The first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` are [1, 2].

   - Constructing `nx`:
     - For the first character 'A' (not a '?'), `nx` includes 'A'.
     - For the second character '?', since `i` (1) is in [1, 2], `nx` includes 'F'.
     - For the third character 'B' (not a '?'), `nx` includes 'B'.
     - For the fourth character '?', since `i` (1) is in [1, 2], `nx` includes 'F'.
     - For the fifth character 'C' (not a '?'), `nx` includes 'C'.
     - For the sixth character '?', since `i` (1) is not in [1, 2] and `j` (2) is in [1, 2], `nx` includes 'F'.
     - For the seventh character 'D' (not a '?'), `nx` includes 'D'.

   - Therefore, `nx` would be "AFBFCSD".

### General Case:
- Without knowing the exact values of `xx[1]` and `sa`, we can describe `nx` as follows:
  - `nx` will contain the characters from `xx[1]` excluding any '?'.
  - For each '?', if the position `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, the character in `nx` will be 'F'.
  - For each '?', if the position `i` or `j` is not in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, the character in `nx` will be 'S'.

### Final Output:
Output: **nx (where nx is a string constructed from xx[1] by replacing '?' with 'F' if i or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa, and with 'S' otherwise)**
