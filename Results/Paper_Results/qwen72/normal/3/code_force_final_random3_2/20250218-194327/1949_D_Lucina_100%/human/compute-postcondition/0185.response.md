Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1. If the character at index 0 of the string at index 3 in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is the character at index 0 of the string at index 3 in `xx`. If the character at index 0 of the string at index 3 in `xx` is '?', and either `i` is in the slice `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the slice `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
