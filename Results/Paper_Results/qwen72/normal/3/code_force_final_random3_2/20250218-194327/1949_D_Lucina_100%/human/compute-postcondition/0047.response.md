Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list that now includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is the input string, `b[i]` is incremented by 1.**

The value of `b[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is `n + 1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
