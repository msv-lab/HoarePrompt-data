Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1, and the element at index 0 of the list `x` is not 'F'. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'S', the value at index 1 of the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value at index 1 of the list `b` remains unchanged.***
