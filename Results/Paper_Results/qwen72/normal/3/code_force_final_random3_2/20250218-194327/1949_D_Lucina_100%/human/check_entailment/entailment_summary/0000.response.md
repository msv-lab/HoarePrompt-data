Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The function correctly reads the integer `n` and the `n` lines of input, forming a symmetric matrix `xx` where the diagonal elements are always '.'.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario, respectively.

2. **Counting Existing Transitions**:
   - The function iterates through the matrix and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each 'F' and 'S' transition. This ensures that the existing transitions are correctly accounted for.

3. **Categorizing Scenarios**:
   - The function categorizes scenarios into two lists, `sa` and `sb`, based on whether they have only 'F' transitions or only 'S' transitions, respectively. This helps in deciding how to fill the remaining '?' transitions.

4. **Deciding Transition Types**:
   - The function decides the type of the remaining transitions based on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`:
     - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, it tries to balance the transitions by assigning 'F' to the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` and 'S' to the rest.
     - If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, it does the opposite, assigning 'S' to the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` and 'F' to the rest.
   - This approach aims to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type are created.

5. **Constructing and Printing the New Matrix**:
   - The function constructs the new matrix by replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions determined in the previous step.
   - It prints the new matrix row by row, maintaining the symmetry and the diagonal '.' characters.

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transitions are already decided.
   - It also respects the requirement that the matrix is symmetric and that the diagonal elements are always '.'.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for replacing '?' characters:
- The condition `n // 4 - 1` might lead to an index out of range error if `n` is small (e.g., `n = 2` or `n = 3`), as `n // 4 - 1` could be negative.
- Additionally, the logic for replacing '?' characters might not always ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type are created, especially in edge cases where the number of undecided transitions is large.

To address these issues, the logic for replacing '?' characters should be more robust, ensuring that the transitions are balanced and the constraints are strictly met.

Correctness: **False**

The program has logical issues that might not always ensure the correct balance of transition types, especially in edge cases. A more robust approach is needed to handle the replacement of '?' characters while adhering to the constraints.
