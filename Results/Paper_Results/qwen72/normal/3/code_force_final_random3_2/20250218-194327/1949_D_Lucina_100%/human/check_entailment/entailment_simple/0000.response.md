### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation and Initialization:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of strings `xx` representing the partial transition video plan.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - The input is correctly validated and the initial state of the program is as expected.

2. **Counting Existing Transitions:**
   - The program iterates through the input grid and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each 'F' and 'S' transition.
   - This ensures that the program has a clear understanding of the existing transitions.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only One Type of Transition:**
   - The program identifies scenarios that have only 'F' transitions (`sa`) and only 'S' transitions (`sb`).
   - This step is crucial for ensuring that the program can balance the transitions later.

4. **Balancing Transitions:**
   - If the number of scenarios with only 'F' transitions (`len(sa)`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only 'S' transitions (`len(sb)`), the program adds scenarios with no transitions to `sa`.
   - Otherwise, it adds scenarios with no transitions to `sb`.
   - This ensures that the program has a balanced approach to assigning the remaining transitions.

5. **Constructing the Full Transition Plan:**
   - The program constructs the full transition plan by iterating through the input grid and replacing '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the following rules:
     - If the current scenario `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` (if `len(sa) >= len(sb)`) or `sb` (if `len(sa) < len(sb)`), it assigns 'F' or 'S' respectively.
     - Otherwise, it assigns the opposite type.
   - This ensures that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type are created.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the full transition plan, which should satisfy the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and initializes the necessary data structures.
- It correctly identifies scenarios with only one type of transition and balances the remaining transitions.
- The logic for constructing the full transition plan ensures that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type are created, which satisfies the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
