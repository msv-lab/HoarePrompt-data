Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2, `nx` is the character at index 0 of the string at index 3 in `xx` concatenated with the character at index 1 of the string at index 3 in `xx` if the character at index 0 of the string at index 3 in `xx` is not '?', otherwise `nx` is 'F' concatenated with the character at index 1 of the string at index 3 in `xx` if either `i` is in the slice `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the slice `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is 'S' concatenated with the character at index 1 of the string at index 3 in `xx`.**
