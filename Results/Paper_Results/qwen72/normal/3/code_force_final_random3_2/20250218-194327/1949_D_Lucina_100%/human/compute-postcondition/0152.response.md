Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `nx` is the character at position 2 in the string `xx`, `j` is 1, and the character at position `i` in the string `xx` (which is 2) and the character at position `j - 1` (which is 0) in the same string `xx` is not '?'**

Explanation:
- `nx` is updated by appending the character at position `i` (which is 2) in the string `xx` and at position `j - 1` (which is 0) in the same string `xx`.
- Since the character at position `i` (2) and `j - 1` (0) in `xx` is not '?', `nx` now contains this character.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The condition that the character at position `i` (2) and `j - 1` (0) in `xx` is not '?' remains valid.
