Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list that now includes the list `x` as its last element, `i` is `n`, `x` is the new input string, and the character at index 0 of `x` is not 'F'. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', `b[1]` and `b[n]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `b[1]` and `b[n]` remain unchanged.***
