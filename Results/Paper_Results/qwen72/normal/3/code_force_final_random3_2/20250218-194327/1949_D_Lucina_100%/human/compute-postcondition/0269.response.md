Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the subsequent `n` elements are the `n` input strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `a` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all elements in `b` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` now includes the index `i`, the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`, `j` is 1, `nx` is the first character of `xx[3]` (which is not equal to '?'), and the character at position `j - 1` (which is position 0) of `xx[i]` (which is `xx[3]`) is not equal to '?'**.
