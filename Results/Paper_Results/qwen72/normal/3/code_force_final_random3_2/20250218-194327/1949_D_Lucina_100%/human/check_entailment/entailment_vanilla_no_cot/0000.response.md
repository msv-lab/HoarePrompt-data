Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Transition Videos**:
   - The program tries to categorize scenarios into `sa` (scenarios with at least one funny transition) and `sb` (scenarios with at least one scary transition). However, this categorization does not guarantee that the transition videos will not have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
   - The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions (`?`) is flawed. It does not ensure that the transitions will meet the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of the scenarios.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Consecutive Videos**:
   - The program does not check the number of consecutive videos of the same type for all possible permutations of the scenarios. This is a critical requirement of the problem, and the program does not address it.

3. **Symmetry and Consistency**:
   - The program does not ensure that the transition matrix remains symmetric (i.e., the transition from scenario \(i\) to scenario \(j\) is the same as from scenario \(j\) to scenario \(i\)). This is a requirement of the problem, and the program does not explicitly handle this.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when \(n\) is small (e.g., \(n = 2\)) or when the input matrix is already fully determined.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve ensuring that the transition videos are assigned in such a way that no permutation of the scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. This can be achieved by:

1. **Counting and Balancing**:
   - Count the number of already determined funny and scary videos.
   - Assign the remaining videos in a balanced way to ensure that no permutation results in too many consecutive videos of the same type.

2. **Symmetry**:
   - Ensure that the transition matrix remains symmetric by assigning the same type of video to both \((i, j)\) and \((j, i)\) pairs.

3. **Permutation Check**:
   - Optionally, you can use a permutation check to verify that the generated matrix meets the requirement for all permutations of the scenarios. However, this is computationally expensive and may not be necessary if the assignment is done correctly.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.
