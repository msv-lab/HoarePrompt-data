The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t - 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `s`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.**
