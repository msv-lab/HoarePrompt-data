The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly initialized to a specific value, but it is used to iterate over the range defined by `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be assigned values within the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
