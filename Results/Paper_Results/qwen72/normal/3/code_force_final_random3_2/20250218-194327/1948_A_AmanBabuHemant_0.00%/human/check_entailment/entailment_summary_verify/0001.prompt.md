You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, if `n` is odd, it prints "NO". If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` consisting of the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Special Character Condition**:
   - The problem states that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2:`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to create a string with an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because in any valid string, special characters must come in pairs (e.g., "AA", "CC").

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each '1' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for `1 <= n <= 50` (since `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`).

4. **Output Handling**:
   - If the length of `s` is less than 200, the program prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`.
   - If the length of `s` is 200 or more, the program prints 'NO'. However, this condition will never be met given the constraints `1 <= n <= 50`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks the condition for the number of special characters, constructs a valid string, and ensures the string length is within the required limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
