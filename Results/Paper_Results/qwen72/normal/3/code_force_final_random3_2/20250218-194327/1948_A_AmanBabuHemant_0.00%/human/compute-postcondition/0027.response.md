Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` is being decremented by 1, but the exact value of `t` is not provided, so we can't determine its final value.
- `n` is an input integer: This means `n` is some integer provided by the user.
- `s` is a string consisting of `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times: This means the string `s` is constructed by repeating the substring `'110'` a number of times equal to the integer division of `n` by 2.
- The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67: This is a condition that ensures the length of `s` is less than 200 when `n // 2` is less than 67.
- The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more: This is a condition that ensures the length of `s` is 200 or more when `n // 2` is 67 or more.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `s`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will always output the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
