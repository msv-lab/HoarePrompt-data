The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, if `n` is odd, it prints "NO". If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` consisting of the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console.
