The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter for the `range(t)` loop. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, so `_` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration to occur.

Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly named or used in the loop head, it is incremented internally by the `for` loop mechanism. Therefore, the state of `t` remains unchanged, and the state of `_` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a`. `_` is incremented by 1.**
