### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Check for Uniform Array**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set `aa` and checking if the length of `aa` is 1.
   - If the length of `aa` is 1, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Counting Consecutive Elements**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` using the variable `cnt`.
   - When it encounters an element that is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

4. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to ensure the last segment of consecutive elements is considered.
   - It then prints `ans`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Uniform Array Case**: The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`.
- **Non-Uniform Array Case**: The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. However, the logic for counting consecutive elements and updating `ans` is flawed:
  - The program only counts consecutive elements that are equal to `a[0]` and updates `ans` based on these counts.
  - This approach does not consider the possibility of making the array not beautiful by removing elements that are not part of the longest segment of consecutive elements.
  - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will count the segments of `1` and `2` but will not consider removing the `2` at index 1 or 3 to make the array not beautiful.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful in all cases.

### Correctness: **False**
