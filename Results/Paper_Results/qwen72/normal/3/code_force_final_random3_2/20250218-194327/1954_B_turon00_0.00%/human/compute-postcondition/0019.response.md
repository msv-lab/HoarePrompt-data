Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n` if `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
