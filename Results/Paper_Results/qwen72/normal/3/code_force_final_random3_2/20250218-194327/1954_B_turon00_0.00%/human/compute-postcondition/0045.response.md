Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 0, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then the program retains all these conditions. `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**

The code snippet `cnt = 0` resets the variable `cnt` to 0, but since `cnt` was already 0 in the initial state, the value of `cnt` remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
