The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful
- `i` is 0
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`
- If the length of `aa` is 1, then the program retains all these conditions
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1
- `n` must remain the same, so `n` is still an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is 1, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then the program retains all these conditions. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
