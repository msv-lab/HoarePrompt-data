The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged, so the output state is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0. If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` observed during the loop, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `_` is incremented by 1, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is 0 and `cnt` is 0. If the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` observed during the loop, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.**
