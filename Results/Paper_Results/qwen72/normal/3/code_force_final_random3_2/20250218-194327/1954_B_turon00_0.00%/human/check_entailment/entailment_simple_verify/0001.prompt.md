You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.

    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `i` is `n-1`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, if the length of `aa` is 1, then `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is `n`, if the length of `aa` is greater than 1, then `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and `cnt` remains the same.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Check for All Elements Being the Same:**
   - The function checks if all elements in the array `a` are the same by converting the array to a set `aa` and checking if the length of the set is 1.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Counting Minimum Elements to Remove:**
   - The function initializes a variable `cnt` to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and increments `cnt` for each element that matches `tmp`.
   - When it encounters an element that does not match `tmp`, it updates the minimum number of elements to remove `ans` with the current count `cnt` and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final count `cnt`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the minimum number of elements to remove `ans`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness for All Elements Being the Same:**
  - If all elements are the same, the function correctly prints `-1` because no matter how many elements you remove, the array will always be beautiful.

- **Correctness for Arrays with Different Elements:**
  - The function aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
  - However, the logic for counting the minimum elements to remove is flawed. The function only counts consecutive elements that match the first element `tmp` and updates the minimum count when it encounters a different element.
  - This approach does not consider the possibility of removing elements that are not consecutive or that do not match the first element.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `3 2 2 2`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Correct: The array consists of identical elements, and it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `5 1 2 1 2 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Correct: By removing the element at index 5, the array becomes `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Correct: The array consists of a single element, and it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
  - Output: `3`
  - Incorrect: The function outputs `3`, but the correct answer should be `1` by removing the element at index 4, making the array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers consecutive elements that match the first element, which is not sufficient for all cases.

### Correctness:
**False**
