The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given that `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is `n`, the value of `ans` will be updated to 0 if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to 0.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`**.
