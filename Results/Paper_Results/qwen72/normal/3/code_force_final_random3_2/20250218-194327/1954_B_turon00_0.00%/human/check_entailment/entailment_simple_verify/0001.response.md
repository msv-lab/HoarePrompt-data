### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Check for All Elements Being the Same:**
   - The function checks if all elements in the array `a` are the same by converting the array to a set `aa` and checking if the length of the set is 1.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - This part of the logic is correct.

3. **Counting Minimum Elements to Remove:**
   - The function initializes a variable `cnt` to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element `tmp`.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and increments `cnt` for each element that matches `tmp`.
   - When it encounters an element that does not match `tmp`, it updates the minimum number of elements to remove `ans` with the current count `cnt` and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final count `cnt`.
   - This approach is flawed because it only considers consecutive elements that match the first element `tmp`. It does not consider the possibility of removing elements that are not consecutive or that do not match the first element.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the minimum number of elements to remove `ans`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness for All Elements Being the Same:**
  - If all elements are the same, the function correctly prints `-1` because no matter how many elements you remove, the array will always be beautiful.
  - This part of the logic is correct.

- **Correctness for Arrays with Different Elements:**
  - The function aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
  - However, the logic for counting the minimum elements to remove is flawed. The function only counts consecutive elements that match the first element `tmp` and updates the minimum count when it encounters a different element.
  - This approach does not consider the possibility of removing elements that are not consecutive or that do not match the first element.
  - For example, in the test case `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the function outputs `3`, but the correct answer should be `1` by removing the element at index 4, making the array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `3 2 2 2`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Correct: The array consists of identical elements, and it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `5 1 2 1 2 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Correct: By removing the element at index 5, the array becomes `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Correct: The array consists of a single element, and it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
  - Output: `3`
  - Incorrect: The function outputs `3`, but the correct answer should be `1` by removing the element at index 4, making the array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers consecutive elements that match the first element, which is not sufficient for all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
