Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

# Annotated Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' or 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found, `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or 0 if 'B' is not found, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the list of tuples is unchanged, `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found, `d` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the end of the string plus 1, `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the end of the string, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or 0 if 'B' is not found, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the list of tuples is unchanged, `l` is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the end of the string (`ma`) and the position of the first 'B' in `s` (`mi`), plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, `mi` is 0, and the program returns `ma + 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value as specified in the annotated code. However, it reads an integer `m` and a string `s` from the user input. It calculates the position of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` (`mi`) and the position of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` from the end of the string (`ma`). The function returns the difference between these positions plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, `mi` is 0, and the function returns `ma + 2`. The function does not modify any external state or parameters.
