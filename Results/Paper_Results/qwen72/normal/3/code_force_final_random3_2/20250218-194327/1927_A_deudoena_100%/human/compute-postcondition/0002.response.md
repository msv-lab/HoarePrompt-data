Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' or 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string.**
