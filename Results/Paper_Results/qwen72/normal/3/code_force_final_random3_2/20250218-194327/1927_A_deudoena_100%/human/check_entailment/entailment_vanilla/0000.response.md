### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `n` times, each time calling the function `func_1()` and printing the result.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads an integer `m` which represents the length of the strip.
   - It reads a string `s` which represents the strip of cells, where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell.
   - It initializes two variables `ma` and `mi` to 0, which will be used to store the positions of the first and last black cells from the left and right, respectively.
   - It initializes two counters `c` and `d` to 0, which will be used to track the position of the first black cell from the left and the last black cell from the right.

3. **Finding the First Black Cell from the Left**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - It increments the counter `c` for each cell.
   - When it encounters the first black cell ('B'), it sets `mi` to the current value of `c` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Finding the Last Black Cell from the Right**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - It increments the counter `d` for each cell.
   - When it encounters the first black cell ('B') from the right, it sets `ma` to the length of the string minus the current value of `d` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length**:
   - The program returns the value `ma - mi + 2`, which is intended to calculate the length of the segment that needs to be painted white to cover all black cells.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Finding the First and Last Black Cells**:
  - The logic for finding the first black cell from the left and the last black cell from the right is correct. The variables `mi` and `ma` will store the positions of these cells.

- **Calculating the Segment Length**:
  - The formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` to account for the inclusive nature of the segment length. The current formula adds an extra 1, which is not necessary.

### Corrected Formula:
- The correct formula to calculate the minimum segment length should be:
  - `ma - mi + 1`

### Conclusion:
- The program is almost correct but has a minor error in the formula used to calculate the segment length. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` instead of `ma - mi + 2`.

### Correctness:
- **False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 1
```

This corrected program will now produce the correct output for the given problem.
