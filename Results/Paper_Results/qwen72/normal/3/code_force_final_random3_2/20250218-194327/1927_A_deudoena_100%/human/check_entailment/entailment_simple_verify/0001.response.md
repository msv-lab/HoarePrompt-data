### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `n`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` and printing the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the strip, `m`, and the string `s` representing the strip.
   - It initializes variables `ma` and `mi` to 0, and `c` and `d` to 0. These variables are used to track the positions of the first and last black cells in the strip.
   - The first loop iterates over the string `s` from left to right:
     - It increments `c` for each cell.
     - If it encounters a black cell ('B'), it sets `mi` to the current position `c` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The second loop iterates over the string `s` from right to left:
     - It increments `d` for each cell.
     - If it encounters a black cell ('B'), it sets `ma` to the length of the string minus `d` (which gives the position of the last black cell from the left) and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it returns `ma - mi + 2`, which is supposed to be the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic of finding the first and last black cells is correct.
   - However, the calculation `ma - mi + 2` is indeed incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment length is inclusive of both endpoints.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the strip has only one black cell, the program will correctly identify the position of that cell and return 1, but due to the incorrect calculation, it will return 2 instead.
   - If the strip has black cells at both ends, the program will correctly identify the positions of the first and last black cells and return the correct segment length, but again, due to the incorrect calculation, it will return an incorrect segment length.

5. **Correction:**
   - The correct return statement should be `return ma - mi + 1` to account for the inclusive nature of the segment length.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the above reasoning, the program is **incorrect** because it returns an incorrect segment length due to the mistake in the calculation.

Final: **False**
