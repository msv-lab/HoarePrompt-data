Postcondition: ***`c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found, `d` is 3, `ma` is `len(s) - 3` if `j` is 'B' or 0 if `j` is not 'B', `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s` or 0 if 'B' is not found, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the list of tuples is unchanged, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the third-to-last character in `s`. If `j` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
