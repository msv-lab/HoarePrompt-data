Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn the entire strip white. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is called without any parameters, and it reads input directly within the function. This is not a good practice, but it does not affect the correctness of the solution as long as the input is provided correctly.

2. **Calculation of `mi` and `ma`**:
   - `mi` is supposed to be the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`.
   - `ma` is supposed to be the position of the last 'B' in the string `s`.

3. **Return Value Calculation**:
   - The function returns `ma - mi + 2`. This calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the actual length of the segment correctly. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` to get the length of the segment from `mi` to `ma`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string `s` is entirely 'W', the function should return 0, but the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.
   - If the string `s` has only one 'B', the function should return 1, but the current implementation might return an incorrect value.

5. **Correct Calculation**:
   - The correct approach should be to find the first and last positions of 'B' and return the length of the segment between these positions, inclusive.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
