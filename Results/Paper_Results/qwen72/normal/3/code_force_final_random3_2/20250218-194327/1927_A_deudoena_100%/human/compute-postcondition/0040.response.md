The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' or 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string.

The function returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the end of the string (`ma`) and the position of the first 'B' in `s` (`mi`), plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, `mi` is 0, and the function returns `ma + 2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with at least one 'B'. It returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' from the end of the string and the position of the first 'B', plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, it returns the position of the last 'B' from the end of the string plus 2.**
