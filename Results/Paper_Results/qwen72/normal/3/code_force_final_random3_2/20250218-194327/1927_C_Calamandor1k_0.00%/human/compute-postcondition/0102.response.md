To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers.
   - `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.
   - `a` and `b` are new lists of integers provided by the user.
   - `len_a` is the length of `a`.
   - `len_b` is the length of `b`.
   - `d` is equal to `k // 2`.
   - `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, and `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and are within the first `max(len_a, len_b) - 1` elements.
   - `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and are within the first `max(len_a, len_b) - 1` elements.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `count_a` is greater than or equal to `d` and `count_b` is greater than or equal to `d`.
   - If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES'.
   - If either condition is false, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Analysis:**
   - `d` is half of `k` (integer division).
   - `i` is the index of the last element to be considered in both lists `a` and `b`, which is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`.
   - `count_a` and `count_b` are the counts of elements in `a` and `b`, respectively, that are less than or equal to `k` and are within the first `i` elements.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - The output depends on whether `count_a` and `count_b` are both greater than or equal to `d`.
   - Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `count_a` and `count_b`.
   - However, based on the conditions, if `count_a` and `count_b` are both greater than or equal to `d`, the output will be 'YES'.
   - If either `count_a` or `count_b` is less than `d`, the output will be 'NO'.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print` statement will output either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values of `count_a` and `count_b` relative to `d`.

Output: **'YES' if `count_a` is greater than or equal to `d` and `count_b` is greater than or equal to `d`, otherwise 'NO' (where `d` is `k // 2`, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and are within the first `max(len_a, len_b) - 1` elements, and `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and are within the first `max(len_a, len_b) - 1` elements)**
