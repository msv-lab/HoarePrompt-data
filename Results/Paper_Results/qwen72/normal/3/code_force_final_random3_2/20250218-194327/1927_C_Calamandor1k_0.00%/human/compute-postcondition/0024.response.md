Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be greater than 0 or `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0, `d` is equal to `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `i` is 1. If `len_a` > 2 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is increased by 1 and `count_b` remains unchanged. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is increased by 1 and `count_a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, both `count_a` and `count_b` remain unchanged.***
