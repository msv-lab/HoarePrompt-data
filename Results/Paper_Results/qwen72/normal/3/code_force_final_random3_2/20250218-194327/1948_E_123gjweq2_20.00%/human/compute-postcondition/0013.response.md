Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, and `mid` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

The code snippet `cliquess[left + i] = clique` assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the `cliquess` list at the index `left + i`. This assignment does not change the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, or `arr[left + i]`. The value of `i` is still `i + 1`, and the condition that `mid` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid. The only change is that the element in the `cliquess` list at the index `left + i` is now set to the value of `clique`.
