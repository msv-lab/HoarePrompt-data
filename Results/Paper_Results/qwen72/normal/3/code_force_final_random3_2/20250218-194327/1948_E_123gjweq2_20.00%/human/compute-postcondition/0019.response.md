Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid-1]`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid-1]`, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `not_mid`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is updated to `big_element - i` for the current value of `i`.**
