Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(big_element - small_element) // 2`. Given that `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, the expression simplifies to `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`, which further simplifies to `(right - left) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
