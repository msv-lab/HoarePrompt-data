Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `not_mid`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the list `cliquess` at the index `left + mid + i`.
- The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `arr[left + mid + i]` is still `right + 1 - i`.
- The new value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.
