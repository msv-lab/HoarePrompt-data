You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We need to create a graph where an edge is added between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the assignment and partition.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`.
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques needed and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` is responsible for assigning values to the vertices and determining their clique membership.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the number of cliques needed. The idea is to divide the vertices into groups of size \(k\), which is a good starting point.
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are initialized to store the assigned values and the clique membership of each vertex.
   - The loop `for i in range(cliques)` calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the start and end indices of the vertices for that clique and the clique number.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - `small_element = left + 1`: This is the smallest element to be assigned in the current range.
   - `big_element = right + 1`: This is the largest element to be assigned in the current range.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2`: This calculates the midpoint of the range, which is used to split the assignment into two parts.
   - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: This calculates the number of elements that will be assigned in the second part.
   - The first loop `for i in range(mid)` assigns the smaller elements to the first half of the range and sets their clique membership.
   - The second loop `for i in range(not_mid)` assigns the larger elements to the second half of the range and sets their clique membership.

5. **Edge Condition**:
   - The program should ensure that the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) holds for all pairs of vertices in the same clique.
   - The way `make_array` assigns values ensures that the difference \(|a_i - a_j|\) is minimized within each clique, which helps in satisfying the edge condition.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique membership for each vertex.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: \(n = 2\), \(k = 3\)
  - `cliques = ceil(2 / 3) = 1`
  - `arr = [2, 1]`
  - `cliquess = [1, 1]`
  - The condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 3\) holds for all pairs \((i, j)\) in the same clique.
  - Output is correct.

- **Test Case 2**: \(n = 5\), \(k = 4\)
  - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
  - `arr = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`
  - `cliquess = [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
  - The condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 4\) holds for all pairs \((i, j)\) in the same clique.
  - Output is correct.

- **Test Case 3**: \(n = 8\), \(k = 16\)
  - `cliques = ceil(8 / 16) = 1`
  - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
  - `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - The condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 16\) holds for all pairs \((i, j)\) in the same clique.
  - Output is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and assign values to the vertices such that the edge condition is satisfied. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
