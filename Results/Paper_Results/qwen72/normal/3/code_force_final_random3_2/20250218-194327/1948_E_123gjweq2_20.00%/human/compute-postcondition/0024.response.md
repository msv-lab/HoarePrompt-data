Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `left` and `right` remain non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`. The array `arr` is updated such that `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`, and `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid-1]`. The array `cliquess` is updated such that `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`, and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid-1]`.**

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the initial values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged. The array `arr` is updated so that the first `mid` elements starting from `left` are filled with values from `left + 1` to `left + mid`, and the remaining `not_mid` elements starting from `left + mid` are filled with values from `right + 1` down to `right + 1 - (not_mid - 1)`. Similarly, the array `cliquess` is updated so that all elements from `left` to `right` are set to the value of `clique`.
