Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + i] = small_element + i` assigns the value `left + 1 + i` to the element at index `left + i` in the array `arr`.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`, so `small_element + i` becomes `left + 1 + i`.
- The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i`.
