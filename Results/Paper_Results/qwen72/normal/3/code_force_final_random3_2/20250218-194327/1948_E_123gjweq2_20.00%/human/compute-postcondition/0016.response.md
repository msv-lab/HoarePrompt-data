Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`, and `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid-1]`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid-1]`**

Explanation:
- The code `arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i` updates the elements of the array `arr` starting from the index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`.
- The value of `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- For each `i` in the range `[0, not_mid-1]`, the element `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `right + 1 - i`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
