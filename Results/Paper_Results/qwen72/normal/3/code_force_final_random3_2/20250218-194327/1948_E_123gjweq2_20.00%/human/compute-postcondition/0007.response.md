The code snippet `cliquess[left + i] = clique` assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the `cliquess` list at the index `left + i`. The initial state specifies that `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, and `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i`.

Since the code does not modify any of the variables `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, or `arr`, these remain unchanged. The only change is in the `cliquess` list, where the element at index `left + i` is set to the value of `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i`, and `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**
