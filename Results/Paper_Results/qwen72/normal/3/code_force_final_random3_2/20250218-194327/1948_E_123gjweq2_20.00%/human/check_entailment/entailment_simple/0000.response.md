### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
   - The function calculates the number of cliques required using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then iterates over the range of `cliques`, calling `make_array` to populate `arr` and `cliquess`.

3. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`:**
   - This function is responsible for assigning values to the vertices and determining their clique membership.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` to determine the range of values to assign.
   - It splits the range into two parts, `mid` and `not_mid`, and assigns values accordingly.
   - The first part assigns values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
   - The second part assigns values from `big_element - not_mid` to `big_element - 1`.
   - Both parts assign the same `clique` value to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the values assigned to the vertices (`arr`).
   - It prints the number of cliques (`cliques`).
   - It prints the clique membership of each vertex (`cliquess`).

### Issues:
- **Clique Assignment:**
  - The function `make_array` is designed to assign values to vertices and determine their clique membership. However, the way it splits the range and assigns values might not always ensure that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
  - Specifically, the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k` must be satisfied for all pairs of vertices in the same clique. The current implementation does not guarantee that this condition is met for all pairs.

- **Clique Membership:**
  - The `cliquess` list is supposed to indicate the clique membership of each vertex. However, the function `make_array` does not ensure that the vertices in the same clique are connected by edges as required by the problem statement.

- **Example Test Cases:**
  - For the test case `2 3`, the output is `2 1`, `1`, `1 1`. This is correct because the graph can be partitioned into a single clique with the given values.
  - For the test case `5 4`, the output is `3 1 5 2 4`, `2`, `1 1 2 1 2`. This is incorrect because the vertices `1` and `2` are not in the same clique, but `|1 - 2| + |3 - 1| = 3` which is less than `4`, so they should be in the same clique.
  - For the test case `8 16`, the output is `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8`, `1`, `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`. This is correct because the graph can be partitioned into a single clique with the given values.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem statement. The issue lies in the `make_array` function, which does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k` is met for all pairs of vertices in the same clique.
