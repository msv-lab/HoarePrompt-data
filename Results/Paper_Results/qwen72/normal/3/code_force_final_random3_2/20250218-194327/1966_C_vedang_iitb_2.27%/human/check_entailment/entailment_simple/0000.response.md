### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they take turns removing the same number of stones `k` from each nonempty pile, with `k` being at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a list `a` of positive integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It first sorts the list and removes duplicates, creating a new list `a_new` with unique elements.
   - Then, it modifies each element in `a_new` starting from the second element by subtracting the previous element in the list. This transformation is crucial because it reduces the problem to a simpler form where the piles are represented by the differences between the unique pile sizes.
   - The function returns the modified list `a_new`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function determines the winner based on the transformed list `a` and its length `n`.
   - If `n` is 1, Alice wins because she can always remove the single pile.
   - If `n` is 2, the winner depends on whether the smallest pile size is even or odd. If it's even, Alice wins; if it's odd, Bob wins.
   - For `n` greater than 2, the function recursively checks if the next player (after Alice's move) can win. If the next player can win (`winNext == 2`), Alice wins. If the next player cannot win (`winNext == 1`), Alice wins only if the smallest pile size is not 1 (since removing 1 stone from each pile would leave the next player in a winning position).

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The transformation in `func_1` is correct because it reduces the problem to a simpler form where the differences between unique pile sizes are considered. This transformation is valid because it preserves the game's state in a way that the optimal moves remain the same.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct for the base cases (when `n` is 1 or 2).
   - The recursive logic in `func_2` is also correct because it correctly handles the cases where the next player can or cannot win based on the smallest pile size and the recursive call.
