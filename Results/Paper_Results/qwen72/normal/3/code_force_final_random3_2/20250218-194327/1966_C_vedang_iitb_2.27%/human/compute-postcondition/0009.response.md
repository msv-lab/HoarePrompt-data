Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), and `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is not equal to 2, `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of positive integers with a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), and `n` is not equal to 1 or 2.
- The code snippet `winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` creates a new variable `winNext` and assigns it the result of calling the function `func_2` with the arguments `a[1:]` (a slice of `a` starting from the second element to the end) and `n - 1` (the value of `n` decremented by 1).
- The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged, but `winNext` now holds the result of the function call.
- Since the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, the output state includes the fact that `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.
