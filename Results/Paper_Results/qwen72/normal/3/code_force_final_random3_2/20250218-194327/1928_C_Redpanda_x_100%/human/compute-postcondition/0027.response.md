Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i * prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `factors[prime] + 1`. The value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.** 

In this output state, the value of `prime_to_i` has been updated to `prime * prime_to_i * prime`, while all other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
