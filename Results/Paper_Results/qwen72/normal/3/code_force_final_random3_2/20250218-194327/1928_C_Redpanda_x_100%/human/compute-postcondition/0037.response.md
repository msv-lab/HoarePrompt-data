The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `factors[prime]`. The loop can execute again if `factors[prime] + 1` is greater than the current value of `_`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes)
- `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element
- `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`
- `factor` is the next element in `rest`
- `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i`
- `factors[prime]` must be at least 0
- The generator yields the value `factor * prime_to_i`

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` must be incremented by 1, and `factors[prime] + 1` must still be greater than `_`.

Since `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, it is incremented by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `factors[prime]` must still be at least 0 to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1**
