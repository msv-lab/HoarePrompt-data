Postcondition: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the value 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be an iterable that has been fully iterated, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime]`.**
