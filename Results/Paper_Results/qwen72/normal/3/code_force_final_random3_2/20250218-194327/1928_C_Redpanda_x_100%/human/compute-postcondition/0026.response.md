Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `factors[prime] + 1`. The value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. After this yield, the state of the variables remains the same as described in the initial state, with no changes to their values or conditions. The only change is that the value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.
