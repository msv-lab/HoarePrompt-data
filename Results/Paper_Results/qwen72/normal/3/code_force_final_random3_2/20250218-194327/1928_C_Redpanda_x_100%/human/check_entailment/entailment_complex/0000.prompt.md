Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factorization of `n`, `nn` is 1, `i` is the smallest integer greater than the largest prime factor of `n` such that `i * i` > `n`.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factorization of `n`. If `nn` > 1, `nn` is included as a key in `factors` (if it wasn't already) and its value is incremented by 1. `nn` is set to 1, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than the largest prime factor of `n` such that `i * i` > `n`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `factors`, `nn`, and `i` remain unchanged.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factorization of `n`, `nn` is 1, `i` is the smallest integer greater than the largest prime factor of `n` such that `i * i` > `n`, `primes` is a list of the keys from the `factors` dictionary, and `generate(0)` has returned an iterable containing all the prime factors of `n`. The generator has yielded all the prime factors of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` where 1 < n <= 10^9. It computes the prime factorization of `n` and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and the generator can be used to iterate over all the prime factors of `n`. The prime factorization is stored in a dictionary `factors` where each key is a prime factor and the value is the exponent indicating how many times the factor divides `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where primes is a list of prime numbers.
def generate(k):
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be an iterable that has been fully iterated, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the last element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime]`.
    #State: `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the value 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be an iterable that has been fully iterated, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate` accepts a non-negative integer `k` and generates a sequence of integers. The sequence is based on the prime numbers in the list `primes` and the corresponding exponents in the dictionary `factors`. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the function yields the integer 1. Otherwise, it recursively generates a sequence of integers by multiplying each integer from the recursive call `generate(k + 1)` by powers of `primes[k]` up to the power specified by `factors[primes[k]]`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all possible products of the prime numbers up to the specified power have been yielded, starting from 1.
