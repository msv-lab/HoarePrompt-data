Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and the value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**
