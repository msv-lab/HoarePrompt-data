If `nn` > 1, `nn` is included as a key in `factors` (if it wasn't already) and its value is incremented by 1. `nn` is set to 1, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than the largest prime factor of `n` such that `i * i` > `n`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `factors`, `nn`, and `i` remain unchanged.

The generator has yielded all the prime factors of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` where 1 < n <= 10^9. It computes the prime factorization of `n` and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, and the generator can be used to iterate over all the prime factors of `n`. The prime factorization is stored in a dictionary `factors` where each key is a prime factor and the value is the exponent indicating how many times the factor divides `n`.

        #State: `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be an iterable that has been fully iterated, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the last element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime]`.
    #State: `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the value 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be an iterable that has been fully iterated, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate` accepts a non-negative integer `k` and generates a sequence of integers. The sequence is based on the prime numbers in the list `primes` and the corresponding exponents in the dictionary `factors`. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the function yields the integer 1. Otherwise, it recursively generates a sequence of integers by multiplying each integer from the recursive call `generate(k + 1)` by powers of `primes[k]` up to the power specified by `factors[primes[k]]`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all possible products of the prime numbers up to the specified power have been yielded, starting from 1.
