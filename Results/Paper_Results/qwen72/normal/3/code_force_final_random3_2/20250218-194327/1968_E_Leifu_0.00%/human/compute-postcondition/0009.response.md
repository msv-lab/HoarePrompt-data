The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for j in range(4, n + 1)` will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 4. The variable `j` will start at 4, and `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute at least one iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
