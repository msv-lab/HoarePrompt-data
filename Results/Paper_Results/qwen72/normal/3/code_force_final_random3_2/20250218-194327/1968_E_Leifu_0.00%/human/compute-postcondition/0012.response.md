Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `j` is 5.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break down what this statement will print:

1. `str(j)` converts the integer value of `j` to a string. Since `j` is 5, `str(j)` will be `'5'`.
2. `' '` is a string containing a single space.
3. The `+` operator concatenates the strings. So, `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` will be `'5' + ' ' + '5'`, which results in the string `'5 5'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **5 5**
