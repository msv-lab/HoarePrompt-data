Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `j` is 6.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break down the execution of this statement:

1. `str(j)` converts the integer `j` to a string. Since `j` is 6, `str(j)` will be `'6'`.
2. The `+` operator is used to concatenate strings. Therefore, `' ' + str(j)` will concatenate a space and the string `'6'`, resulting in `' 6'`.
3. The final string to be printed is `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)`, which is `'6' + ' ' + '6'`.

Combining these, the output will be:
Output: **6 6**
