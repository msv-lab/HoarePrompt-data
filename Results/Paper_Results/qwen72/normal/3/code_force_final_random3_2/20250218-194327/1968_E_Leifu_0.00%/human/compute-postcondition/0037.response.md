To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head is:
```
for j in range(4, n + 1):
```
This loop will execute if the range `range(4, n + 1)` is not empty. For the range to be non-empty, `n + 1` must be greater than 4, which means `n` must be greater than 3.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `t` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- If `n` is at least 4, `j` is set to `n`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 3, and `j` will start from 4.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
