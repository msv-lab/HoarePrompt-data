The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('2 4')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'2 4'`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. However, these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the string `'2 4'` exactly as it is written in the code.
Output: **2 4**
