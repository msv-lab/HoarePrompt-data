Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be `n + 1` because the loop iterates from 4 to `n` inclusive. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 is still true, as this was the requirement for the loop to execute at least once.
