Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) representing the size of an n x n grid. The function then prints a series of coordinates for each test case. Specifically, it always prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2). If `n` is 3, it prints (2, 3). If `n` is greater than 3, it prints (2, 4) and then prints (j, j) for all integers `j` from 4 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. **
