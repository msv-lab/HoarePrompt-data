Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is 0, and `i` is `t - 1`. If `n` is 3, `j` is not modified. If `n` is greater than 3, `j` is set to `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has run `t` times, and `t` is the number of iterations.
- The variable `i` will be `t - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t - 1`, and after the last iteration, `i` will be `t - 1`.
- The variable `n` will still be an input integer, as it is read from the input during each iteration and is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `j` will be set to `n` if `n` is greater than 3, due to the inner loop that runs from `4` to `n`. If `n` is 3, `j` will not be modified because the inner loop does not run in that case.
