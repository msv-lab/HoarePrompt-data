Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and if `n` is at least 4, `j` is set to `n`.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. If the new value of `n` is at least 4, `j` is set to this new value of `n`. If `n` is 3, no changes are made to `n`, `t`, `i`, or `j`.
