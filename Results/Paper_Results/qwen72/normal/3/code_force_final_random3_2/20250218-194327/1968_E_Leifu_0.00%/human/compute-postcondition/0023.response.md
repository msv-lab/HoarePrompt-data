The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will start with `j` being 4 and will continue as long as `n + 1` is greater than 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 4**
