Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. The logic of the program checks if either dimension of the rectangle (a or b) is even. If at least one of the dimensions is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is different from the original (considering the 90° rotation equivalence). If both dimensions are odd, it is not possible to form a new rectangle that is different from the original, because cutting an odd-length side will result in two rectangles that can only be rearranged to form the original rectangle or its 90° rotation.

The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem, and the logic is sound for determining whether Bob can obtain a different rectangle.
