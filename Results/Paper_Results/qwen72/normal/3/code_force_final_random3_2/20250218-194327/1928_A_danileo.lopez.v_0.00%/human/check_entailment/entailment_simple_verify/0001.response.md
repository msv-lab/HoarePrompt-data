Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can form a new rectangle from an original rectangle of size \(a \times b\) by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then combining them. The new rectangle must be different from the original in terms of its dimensions, considering that 90-degree rotations of the same dimensions are considered the same.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles. These two rectangles can then be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(a \times (b/2)\) or \((a/2) \times b\).
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. Therefore, he cannot form a new rectangle.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - If the condition is false, it prints "No".

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the condition for forming a new rectangle: if either dimension is even, Bob can form a new rectangle.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
   - The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

5. **Validation Using Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case by reading \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The annotated code also confirms that the program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and prints "Yes" if true, and "No" if false.
   - The state of the program at the end of the loop is consistent with the problem requirements, where each test case is processed independently.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \(a\) and \(b\) are both 1 (i.e., the smallest possible rectangle), which cannot be cut into smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - The program also correctly handles larger values of \(a\) and \(b\) up to \(10^9\), as the modulo operation and integer division are efficient and will not cause issues with such large inputs.

Given the above reasoning and validation using the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
