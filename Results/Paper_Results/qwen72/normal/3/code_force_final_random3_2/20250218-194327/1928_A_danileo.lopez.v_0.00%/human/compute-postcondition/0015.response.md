Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder variable that is incremented by 1.
- `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`.
- `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, and they have been updated to the new values provided by the user.

The provided code snippet is:
```
print('Yes')
```

This code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the output of this statement because the `print` statement is not dependent on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
