Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable that has been incremented `t` times, and `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` were updated to new values provided by the user. If either `a` or `b` was even in any iteration, 'Yes' was printed; otherwise, 'No' was printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the placeholder variable `_` has been incremented `t` times, and the values of `a` and `b` have been updated `t` times with new inputs provided by the user. For each of these `t` iterations, the program checked if either `a` or `b` was even and printed 'Yes' if so, or 'No' if both were odd. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the final values of `a` and `b` are the last inputs provided by the user.
