Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can form a new rectangle from an \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it and rearranging the pieces.
   - A new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles. These two rectangles can then be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(a \times (b/2)\) or \((a/2) \times b\).
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. Therefore, he cannot form a new rectangle.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - If the condition is false, it prints "No".

4. **Validation Using Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
   - The loop iterates \(t\) times, and for each iteration, it reads new values of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0` is used to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The program prints "Yes" if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, and "No" otherwise.

5. **Edge Cases and Examples**:
   - For the input `1 1`, both dimensions are odd, so the output "No" is correct.
   - For the input `2 1`, both dimensions are not such that a new rectangle can be formed, so the output "No" is correct.
   - For the input `2 6`, \(a\) is even, so the output "Yes" is correct.
   - For the input `3 2`, \(b\) is even, so the output "Yes" is correct.
   - For the input `2 2`, both dimensions are even, so the output "Yes" is correct.
   - For the input `2 4`, \(a\) is even, so the output "Yes" is correct.
   - For the input `6 3`, \(a\) is even, so the output "Yes" is correct.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.
   - The program correctly identifies whether a new rectangle can be formed based on the given conditions.
   - The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
