Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, and `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9. `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`. If either `a` is even or `b` is even, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values provided by the user. If both `a` and `b` are odd, `a` and `b` are also updated to new integer values provided by the user.***
