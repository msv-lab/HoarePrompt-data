Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then recombined to form a different rectangle, considering that rectangles differing only by a 90Â° rotation are the same.

To solve this, we need to understand the conditions under which Bob can form a different rectangle:
1. **Cutting the Rectangle**: Bob can cut the rectangle parallel to one of its sides. If the cut is parallel to the side of length \(a\), the resulting rectangles will have dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) and \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\). If the cut is parallel to the side of length \(b\), the resulting rectangles will have dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) and \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\).

2. **Recombining the Rectangles**: After cutting, Bob can recombine the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle can be:
   - \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) if the cut was parallel to \(b\).
   - \(2b \times \frac{a}{2}\) if the cut was parallel to \(a\).

3. **Forming a Different Rectangle**: The new rectangle will be different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle if the dimensions are not the same as the original rectangle. This means the new dimensions should not be \(a \times b\) or \(b \times a\).

Given the above, the key condition is that at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) must be even. This is because:
- If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles and recombine them to form a \(2 \times \frac{a}{2} \times b\) rectangle.
- If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles and recombine them to form a \(a \times 2 \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangle.

If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then neither dimension can be halved to form a new rectangle with integer dimensions, and thus Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

The provided program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and prints "Yes" if at least one of them is even, and "No" otherwise. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
