Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, and `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9. If either `a` is even or `b` is even, the condition is satisfied. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the condition is not satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, and `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9. `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`. If either `a` is even or `b` is even, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values provided by the user. If both `a` and `b` are odd, `a` and `b` are also updated to new integer values provided by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`. `a` and `b` are integers input by the user such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, and `a` and `b` have been updated to the new values provided by the user. If `a` or `b` is even, the program executes the if part. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program executes the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
