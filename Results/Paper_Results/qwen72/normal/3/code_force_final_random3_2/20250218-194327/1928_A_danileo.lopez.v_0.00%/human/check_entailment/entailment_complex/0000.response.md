Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle. The key insight here is that for Bob to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) must be even. This is because:

- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, cutting the rectangle will always result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions. When these two smaller rectangles are reassembled, the only possible new rectangle is the original one, which means no different rectangle can be formed.
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, cutting the rectangle parallel to the even side will result in at least one rectangle with an even dimension. This allows for the possibility of reassembling the two smaller rectangles into a different rectangle. For example, a \(3 \times 2\) rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, which can then be reassembled into a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle.

The program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
- It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
- If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes'.
- If both are odd, it prints 'No'.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program appears to be correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
