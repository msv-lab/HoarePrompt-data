You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):

            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True.

    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1

            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the number of times `arr[0]` appears in `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered. If `arr[0]` never changes throughout the array, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of the initial `ans` and the count of `arr[0]` in the list `arr`.
        #
        #Output:
    #State: *`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the number of times `arr[0]` appears in `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` and `cnt`. If `arr[0]` never changes throughout the array, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'). If `flag` is True, it indicates that all consecutive elements in `arr` are equal. If `flag` is False, it indicates that there are at least two consecutive elements in `arr` that are not equal.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Loop Structure:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Check for Identical Elements:**
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are identical by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are identical (`flag` remains `True`), the program correctly outputs `-1` because an array of identical elements cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any elements.

3. **Counting and Minimum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that can be minimized.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive occurrences of the first element `val` and stores this count in `cnt`.
   - For each different element encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - Finally, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` after the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - If the array is not all identical, the program outputs the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:

1. **Use of `Decimal` for Integer Operations:**
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `Decimal` for integer operations is unnecessary and can be simplified. Python's `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9` would suffice.

2. **Logic for Non-Identical Elements:**
   - The logic for counting and finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only counts the consecutive occurrences of the first element and does not consider the general case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements that allow the operation to be applied.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To make an array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced by `a[i-1]`.
   - One way to achieve this is to remove elements such that the remaining array does not have any such index `i`.
   - The correct approach would be to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` for all `i`.

### Correctness:
- The given program is **incorrect** because it only checks for consecutive occurrences of the first element and does not handle the general case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing different elements.

### Corrected Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if all elements are the same
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1]:
            ans = min(ans, 1)
    
    # If no such index is found, the array is already non-beautiful
    if ans == float('inf'):
        print(0)
    else:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Set Check:** `len(set(arr)) == 1` checks if all elements in the array are identical.
- **Minimum Removal:** The program iterates through the array to find any index `i` where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and sets `ans` to 1, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
- **Output:** If no such index is found, the array is already non-beautiful, and the program outputs `0`.

Correctness: **False**
