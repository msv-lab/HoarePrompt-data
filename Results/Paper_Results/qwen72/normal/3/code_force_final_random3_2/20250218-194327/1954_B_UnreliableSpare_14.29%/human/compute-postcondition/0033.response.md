Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the number of times `arr[0]` appears in `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered. If `arr[0]` never changes throughout the array, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `n` does not change.
- The value of `i` is `n-1` after the loop completes.
- The value of `flag` is False if there are any two consecutive elements in `arr` that are not equal; otherwise, it remains True.
- The value of `val` is still `arr[0]`.
- The value of `cnt` is the total number of times `arr[0]` appears in the array `arr`.
- The value of `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered. If `arr[0]` is the same for all elements in the array, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').
