Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying the Minimum Number of Removals:**
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that can be removed to make the array not beautiful. However, it does not correctly handle the condition where the array can be made not beautiful by removing elements that are not necessarily consecutive.
   - The program only checks the count of the first element in the array and uses it to determine the minimum number of removals, which is incorrect.

2. **Handling of All Identical Elements:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful, and it prints `-1`.

3. **Incorrect Use of `Decimal` for Minimum Calculation:**
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` for initializing the minimum value is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler integer value like `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9`.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to identify the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if all elements are the same
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Count the number of elements that can be removed to make the array not beautiful
    min_removals = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1] and arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:
            min_removals = min(min_removals, 1)
        elif arr[i] == arr[i - 1] and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
            min_removals = min(min_removals, 2)
    
    if min_removals == float('inf'):
        print(1)
    else:
        print(min_removals)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Check if All Elements are the Same:**
   - If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful, so the program prints `-1`.

2. **Count Minimum Removals:**
   - Iterate through the array and check for elements that can be removed to make the array not beautiful.
   - If an element at index `i` is different from both its neighbors, removing this element will make the array not beautiful, so the minimum removals is `1`.
   - If an element at index `i` is the same as both its neighbors, removing two elements (either `i-1` and `i` or `i` and `i+1`) will make the array not beautiful, so the minimum removals is `2`.
   - If no such elements are found, the minimum removals is `1` (since removing any element will break the pattern).

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.
