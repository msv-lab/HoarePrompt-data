Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

# Annotated Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` is a beautiful array where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the number of times `arr[0]` appears in `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `arr[0]` before a different element is encountered. If `arr[0]` never changes throughout the array, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of the initial `ans` and the count of `arr[0]` in the list `arr`.
        #
        #Output:
    #State: *`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the number of times `arr[0]` appears in `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` and `cnt`. If `arr[0]` never changes throughout the array, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'). If `flag` is True, it indicates that all consecutive elements in `arr` are equal. If `flag` is False, it indicates that there are at least two consecutive elements in `arr` that are not equal.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `arr` of length `n` for each of `t` test cases. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in `arr` and prints this value. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` is the original list of integers, and the state of the program is as it was before the function call, except for the printed output.
