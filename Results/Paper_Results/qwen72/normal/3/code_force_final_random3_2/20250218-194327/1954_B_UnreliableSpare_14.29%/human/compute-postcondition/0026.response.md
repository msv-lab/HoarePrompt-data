Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 1. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'). If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `ans` is 0.**

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. If `arr[i]` (where `i` is 1) is equal to `val` (which is `arr[0]`), `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'). If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `ans` is 0.
