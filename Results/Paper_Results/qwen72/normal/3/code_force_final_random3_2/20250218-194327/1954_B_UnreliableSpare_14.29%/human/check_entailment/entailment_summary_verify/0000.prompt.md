You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `arr` of length `n` for each of `t` test cases. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in `arr` and prints this value. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` is the original list of integers, and the state of the program is as it was before the function call, except for the printed output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is not composed entirely of identical elements but is still beautiful. The logic in the program checks if all elements in the array are the same and, if so, prints `-1`. However, this approach is flawed because an array can be beautiful even if not all elements are the same, as long as the condition \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) can be used to make all elements the same.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is beautiful because you can perform the operation to make it `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The program should output `1` because removing the last element (or any other element that breaks the pattern) will make the array not beautiful. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove.

Another example where the program fails is:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` is beautiful because you can perform the operation to make it `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. The program should output `3` because removing the first three elements (or any other set of three elements that breaks the pattern) will make the array not beautiful. However, the program incorrectly outputs `3` because it does not correctly handle the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove.

The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed, and it does not correctly handle all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
