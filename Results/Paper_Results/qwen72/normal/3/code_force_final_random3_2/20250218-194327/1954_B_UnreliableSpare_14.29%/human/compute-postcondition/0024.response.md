Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity'). If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `ans` is 0 and `cnt` remains 0.***
