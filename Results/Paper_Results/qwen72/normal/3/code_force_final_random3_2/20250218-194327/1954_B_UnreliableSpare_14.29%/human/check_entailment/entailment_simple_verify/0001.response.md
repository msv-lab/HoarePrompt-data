### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Loop Structure:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Check for Identical Elements:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are identical by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are identical (`flag` remains `True`), the program correctly outputs `-1` because an array of identical elements cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any elements.

3. **Counting and Minimum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that can be minimized.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive occurrences of the first element `val` and stores this count in `cnt`.
   - For each different element encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - Finally, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` after the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - If the array is not all identical, the program outputs the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:

1. **Use of `Decimal` for Integer Operations:**
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `Decimal` for integer operations is unnecessary and can be simplified. Python's `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9` would suffice.

2. **Logic for Non-Identical Elements:**
   - The logic for counting and finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only counts the consecutive occurrences of the first element and does not consider the general case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements that allow the operation to be applied.
   - The program should instead find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` for all `i`.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To make an array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced by `a[i-1]`.
   - One way to achieve this is to remove elements such that the remaining array does not have any such index `i`.
   - The correct approach would be to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` for all `i`.

### Evaluation of Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
  - The function should take no parameters, as it reads input directly.

- **State After Identical Elements Check:**
  - The `flag` is set to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
  - This part of the code is correct and aligns with the problem's requirement to check if the array is all identical.

- **State After Minimum Calculation:**
  - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and starts counting the occurrences of the first element `val`.
  - The program updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` before a different element is encountered.
  - This logic is flawed because it only considers the first element and does not handle the general case.

- **Final State:**
  - If `flag` is `True`, the program correctly outputs `-1`.
  - If `flag` is `False`, the program outputs `ans`, which is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element. This is incorrect because it does not consider the general case of making the array non-beautiful.

### Final Answer:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program is **incorrect** because it only checks for consecutive occurrences of the first element and does not handle the general case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing different elements.

Final: **False**
