Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1 or 2 and `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity') if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0 or 1 and `ans` is 0.**
