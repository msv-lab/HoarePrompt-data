Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `flag` is False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are not equal, otherwise `flag` remains True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 1 or 2, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity') if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- If `arr[i]` is equal to `val` (which is `arr[0]`), `cnt` was initially 1, so now `cnt` is 2.
- If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` was initially 0, so now `cnt` is 1.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `flag`, `val`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
