The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `a`, and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The parameters have the following constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The list `a` is guaranteed to be a beautiful array according to the problem's definition.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints. Assuming the function processes the list `a` and returns some computed value or property for each test case, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, a list of integers `a`, and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. It processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a result based on the properties of the beautiful array `a` for each test case.**
