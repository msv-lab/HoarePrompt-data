Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `arr` of length `n` for each of `t` test cases. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in `arr` and prints this value. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` is the original list of integers, and the state of the program is as it was before the function call, except for the printed output. **
