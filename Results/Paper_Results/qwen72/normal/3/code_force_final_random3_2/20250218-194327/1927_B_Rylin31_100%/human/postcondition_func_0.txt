The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and a list of integers `array` from the input. It then constructs a string `ans` by mapping each integer in `array` to a corresponding lowercase Latin letter, where the letter is determined by the current value in a list `s` of length `l` initialized to zeros. The value in `s` at the index specified by each integer in `array` is incremented after each mapping. The function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are unchanged, and the program state includes the printed strings for all test cases.
