Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each `s[j]` is equal to the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` has `m` elements (where `m` is the length of `array`), each element in `array` is greater than 0, `j` is the last element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing characters corresponding to the cumulative sum of `s[j]` at each position in `array`, starting from 97 (ASCII value of 'a').**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `int(input())`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The variable `l` is still the input integer greater than 0.
- The list `s` now contains integers where each `s[j]` is the count of how many times the index `j` appeared in the `array`.
- The list `array` has `m` elements, and each element is greater than 0.
- The variable `j` is the last element in the `array`.
- The string `ans` is constructed by converting each `s[j]` to a character using the ASCII value starting from 97 (which corresponds to 'a'), and concatenating these characters in the order they appear in `array`.
