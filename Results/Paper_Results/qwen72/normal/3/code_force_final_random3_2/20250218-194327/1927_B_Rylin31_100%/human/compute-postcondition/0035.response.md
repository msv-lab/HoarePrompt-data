The code snippet `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `array`. This overwrites the previous value of `array`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0, `array` is a list of integers read from input, `j` is the last element in the new `array`, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the new `array`, in the order they appeared in the new `array`.**
