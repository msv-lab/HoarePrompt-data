Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0, `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0 and `m` is at least 1, `j` is the first element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.
- `s[j]` is 0 because `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0.
- Therefore, `s[j] + 97` is `97`, which corresponds to the character `'a'`.
- So, `ans` becomes `'a'`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
