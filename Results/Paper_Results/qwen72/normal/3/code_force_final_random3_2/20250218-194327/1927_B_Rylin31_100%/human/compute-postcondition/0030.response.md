Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except for the elements at indices that were in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appeared in `array`, `array` is a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0, `j` is the last element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appeared in `array`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `int(input())`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The variable `l` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- The list `s` is updated such that each element at an index that was present in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appeared in `array`.
- The list `array` remains a list of `m` integers where each element is greater than 0.
- The variable `j` is the last element in `array`.
- The string `ans` is constructed by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appeared in `array`.
