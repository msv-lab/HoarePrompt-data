Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least one element, `j` is the first element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`**

Explanation:
- The value of `s[j]` is incremented by 1, so `s[j]` is now 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `j` is the first element in `array`.
- The string `ans` still contains the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`, which is now `1 + 97` (i.e., the character 'a' + 1).
