Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, `i` is 2, `l` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element is 0 except for the elements corresponding to the indices in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers read from input, `j` is the last element in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The variable `l` is still an input integer greater than 2.
- The list `s` now has elements that are incremented based on the frequency of their indices in the `array`.
- The variable `array` is the same list of integers read from input.
- The variable `j` is the last element in `array`.
- The string `ans` contains characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, in the order they appear in `array`. Each character is determined by the current value of `s[j]` at the time of the loop iteration, and `s[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `array`.
