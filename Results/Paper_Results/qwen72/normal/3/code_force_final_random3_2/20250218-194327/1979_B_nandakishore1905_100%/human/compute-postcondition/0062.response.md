Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are the new input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `k = abs(n - m)` calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions for `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is now the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
