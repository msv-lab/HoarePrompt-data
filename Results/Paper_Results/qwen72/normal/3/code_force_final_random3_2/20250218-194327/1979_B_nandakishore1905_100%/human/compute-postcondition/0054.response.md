Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and must not be a power of 2, `p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is `k - 3 * q` and must not be a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- The code `q = 2 ** (p - 1)` reassigns the value of `q` to \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
- The value of `p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.
- The value of `q` is now explicitly calculated as \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `f`, and `l`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
