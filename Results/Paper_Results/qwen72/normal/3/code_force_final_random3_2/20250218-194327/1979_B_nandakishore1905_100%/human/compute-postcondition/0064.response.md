The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` and `m` are new input integers greater than 0.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`.
   - None of the variables `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, or `k` are used in the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the integer `1`.
Output: **1**
