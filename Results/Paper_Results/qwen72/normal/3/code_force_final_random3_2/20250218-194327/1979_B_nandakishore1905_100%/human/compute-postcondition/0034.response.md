Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

The value of `k` is updated to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
