Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2, and `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the string `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1).**

Explanation:
- `q` is assigned the value of `2 ** (p - 1)`.
- The value of `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k` (which is even and not a power of 2).
- Therefore, `q` is calculated as `2` raised to the power of `(p - 1)`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`) remain unchanged.
