Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and must not be a power of 2, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is `k - 2 * q` and must not be a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` updates the value of `l` to be the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `p`, `q`, and `f` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the updated value of `l`.
