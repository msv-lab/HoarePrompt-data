Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2. If `k` is odd, the program retains the initial values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. If `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the updated string `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1), `f` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and `f` is a power of 2.**
