#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. The list `a` contains integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: `N` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `N-1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `N-1`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop will return the smallest index `i` such that `cnt[i]` is 0 or `t` is greater than or equal to 2. If no such index is found, `i` will be `N + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` integers `a`. It counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. The function then iterates through the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive) and returns the smallest index `i` where either the count of `i` in `cnt` is 0 or the count of unique integers with exactly one occurrence (`t`) is greater than or equal to 2. If no such index is found, the function returns `N + 1`.
