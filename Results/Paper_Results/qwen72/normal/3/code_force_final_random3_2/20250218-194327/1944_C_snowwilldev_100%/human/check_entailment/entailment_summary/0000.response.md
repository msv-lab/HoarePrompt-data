Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play their game optimally. The optimal strategy for Alice is to pick elements that will maximize the MEX, while Bob's strategy is to minimize it. The key to solving this problem is to understand the distribution of elements and how they affect the MEX.

The function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It reads the integer `N` and the list `a`.
2. It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
3. It then iterates through the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive) to find the smallest integer `i` that either:
   - Does not appear in `a` (`cnt[i] == 0`), or
   - Appears exactly once in `a` and there are already two such unique integers with exactly one occurrence (`t >= 2`).

The logic behind this is:
- If `cnt[i] == 0`, then `i` is the MEX because it is the smallest integer not in the array.
- If `cnt[i] == 1` and there are already two such unique integers with exactly one occurrence, Alice and Bob will both pick these unique elements, and the MEX will be the next integer that is not in the array.

This approach ensures that the MEX is correctly determined based on the optimal play of both players. The function correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
