To determine the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` starts from 0.
- `t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0.
- `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `N-1`.
- `t` is less than 2.
- `cnt[i]` is not 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(N + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N + 1`.
2. **State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value `k` (where `k` is less than `N + 1`).
3. **State of `N`**: `N` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
4. **Increment of `i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `k + 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `k + 1`.
- `N` remains the same, so it is still greater than or equal to 0.
- The conditions on `t` and `cnt` are not directly affected by the loop head, so they remain the same.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
- `t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0.
- `t` is less than 2.
- `cnt[i]` is not 0.

Since `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, and it is incremented by 1, the new state is:
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0, `t` is less than 2, `cnt[i]` is not 0**
