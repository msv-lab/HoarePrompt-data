Output State: **The program returns the value of `i`, which is `k + 2`.** 

In this output state, `i` is the variable that holds the value `k + 2`, where `k` is a value that, when increased by 2, results in `i`. The program always returns this value, regardless of the value of `cnt[i]`. However, it is mentioned that if `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is set to 3, but this does not affect the return value of `i`. If `cnt[i]` is not 1, `t` remains 0, but again, this does not change the return value of `i`.
