Output State: **`N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 2**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[a[0]]` by 1, since `i` is 1 and `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`. Given that `cnt[a[0]]` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, it is now incremented by an additional 1, making it a total increment of 2. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged.
