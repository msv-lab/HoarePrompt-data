The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` integers `a`. It counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. The function then iterates through the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive) and returns the smallest index `i` where either the count of `i` in `cnt` is 0 or the count of unique integers with exactly one occurrence (`t`) is greater than or equal to 2. If no such index is found, the function returns `N + 1`.
