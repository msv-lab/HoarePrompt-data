### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `n % 2`.
   - If `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`.
   - If `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - The program checks if `n` is even using the same `n % 2` check (by negating the condition).
   - If `n` is even and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`.
   - If `n` is even and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost calculated.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 9`.
  - Output: `2 * 5 = 10` (but the correct output should be `9` because `b` is cheaper for two yogurts).
  - **Correct Output**: `9`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 9`.
  - Output: `3 * 5 = 15` (but the correct output should be `14` because buying two yogurts at `b` and one at `a` is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `14`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 11`.
  - Output: `3 * 5 = 15` (correct because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `15`

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 11`.
  - Output: `4 * 5 = 20` (correct because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `20`

### Analysis of the Original Assessment:

The original assessment correctly identified the logical error in the odd case where the program should always consider the promotion price for pairs and then add the cost of the single yogurt. The original program fails to do this, leading to incorrect outputs for some test cases.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            print(n // 2 * b + a)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not always produce the correct minimum cost for odd values of `n`. The corrected program ensures that the promotion price is always considered for pairs, and the single yogurt is added separately if `n` is odd.

Final: **False**
