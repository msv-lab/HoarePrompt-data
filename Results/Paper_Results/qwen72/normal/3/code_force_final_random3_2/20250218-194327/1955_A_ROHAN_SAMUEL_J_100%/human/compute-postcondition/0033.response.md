Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case have been processed according to the conditions specified in the loop. The loop variable `_` is equal to `t - 1`, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. The conditions `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30` remain true for each processed test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the loop variable `_` has reached the value `t - 1`, where `t` is the total number of test cases specified at the beginning. For each test case, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been used to determine the output based on the conditions in the loop. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case have been processed, and the conditions `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30` have been maintained throughout the execution.
