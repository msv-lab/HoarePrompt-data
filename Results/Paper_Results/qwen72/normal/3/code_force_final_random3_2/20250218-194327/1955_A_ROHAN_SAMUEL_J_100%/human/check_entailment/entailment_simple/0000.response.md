### Reasoning:
The program aims to calculate the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given the price of one yogurt (`a`) and the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`). The logic is as follows:

1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2`):**
   - If the number of yogurts `n` is odd, Maxim will need to buy one yogurt at the regular price and the rest in pairs.
   - The program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotional price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, the total cost is `a * n` (all yogurts are bought at the regular price).
   - Otherwise, the total cost is `n // 2 * b + a` (buying `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price and one at the regular price).

2. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If the number of yogurts `n` is even, Maxim will buy all yogurts in pairs.
   - The program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotional price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, the total cost is `a * n` (all yogurts are bought at the regular price).
   - Otherwise, the total cost is `n // 2 * b` (buying `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price).

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.
  - This is correctly handled by the `for` loop and the `input().split()` method.

- **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
  - The condition `if n % 2` correctly identifies if `n` is odd.
  - The logic `if 2 * a < b` ensures that if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, the program prints `a * n`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`, which is the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price and one yogurt at the regular price.

- **Even Number of Yogurts:**
  - The condition `elif 2 * a < b` correctly identifies if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper.
  - If so, it prints `a * n`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b`, which is the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price.

### Edge Cases:
- **When `b` is less than or equal to `2 * a`:**
  - The program correctly uses the promotional price for pairs and the regular price for any remaining single yogurt.
- **When `b` is greater than `2 * a`:**
  - The program correctly buys all yogurts at the regular price, which is cheaper.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1: `2 5 9`**
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` (regular price for two yogurts)
  - `b = 9` (promotional price for two yogurts)
  - Since `b < 2 * a`, the program prints `9`.
- **Test Case 2: `3 5 9`**
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` (regular price for two yogurts)
  - `b = 9` (promotional price for two yogurts)
  - Since `b < 2 * a`, the program prints `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
- **Test Case 3: `3 5 11`**
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` (regular price for two yogurts)
  - `b = 11` (promotional price for two yogurts)
  - Since `2 * a < b`, the program prints `3 * 5 = 15`.
- **Test Case 4: `4 5 11`**
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` (regular price for two yogurts)
  - `b = 11` (promotional price for two yogurts)
  - Since `2 * a < b`, the program prints `4 * 5 = 20`.
