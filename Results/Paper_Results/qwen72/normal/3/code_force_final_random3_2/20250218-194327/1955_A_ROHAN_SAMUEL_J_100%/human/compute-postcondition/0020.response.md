To determine what will be printed by the `print(a * n)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input by the user.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds.
   - If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.
   - If `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds.
   - If `n` is even and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(a * n)` will print the product of `a` and `n`.

Given the conditions, the value of `a * n` depends on the values of `a` and `n`, but the conditions do not provide specific values for `a` and `n`. Instead, they describe the relationship between `2 * a` and `b` based on the parity of `n`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The print statement will output the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where `a` and `n` are integers input by the user, and `n` is greater than 0)**
