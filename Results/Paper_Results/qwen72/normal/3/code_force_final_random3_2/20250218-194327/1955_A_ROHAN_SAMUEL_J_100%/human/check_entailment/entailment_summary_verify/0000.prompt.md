You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the following logic: if `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`; if `n` is even and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is even and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program state is such that all test cases have been processed and their respective results have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts (b) is less than or equal to the regular price for two yogurts (2 * a) correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the total cost when the number of yogurts (n) is even and the promotion price (b) is less than the regular price for two yogurts (2 * a).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 5 9
```

The program should output 18, because the promotion price (9) is less than the regular price for two yogurts (10), and it is more cost-effective to buy two yogurts at a time using the promotion. However, the program outputs 20, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic for handling even numbers of yogurts. The program should always use the promotion price when it is cheaper, regardless of whether the number of yogurts is even or odd. The correct logic should be:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)
```

This ensures that the program always uses the cheaper option for buying yogurts, whether the number of yogurts is even or odd.
