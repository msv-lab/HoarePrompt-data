The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the input that determines the range of the loop. The loop will execute one more time if `_` is less than the input value. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and the input value is an integer that is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and the input value must still be greater than `_`.

State: **`_` is 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are the second and third integers input by the user, respectively. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.**
