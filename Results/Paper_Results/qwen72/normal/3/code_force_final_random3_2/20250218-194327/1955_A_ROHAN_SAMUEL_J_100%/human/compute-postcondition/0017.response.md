Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input by the user.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The conditions for `n` and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b` are as follows:
  - If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds.
  - If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.
  - If `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, the condition `2 * a < b` holds.
  - If `n` is even and `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the condition `2 * a >= b` holds.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * n)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply multiplies `a` by `n` and prints the result.
- The value of `a` and `n` are not explicitly given, but we know that `n` is a positive integer.
- The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the value of `a * n` directly; they only describe the relationship between `2 * a` and `b` based on the parity of `n`.

### Output:
- The output will be the product of `a` and `n`.
- Since `a` and `n` are integers and `n` is greater than 0, the output will be an integer value.

Output: **a * n (where `a` and `n` are integers input by the user, and `n` is greater than 0)**
