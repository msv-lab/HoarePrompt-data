### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it means buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper. The program calculates the cost for `n // 2` pairs and adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`a`), resulting in `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even, the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it means buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper. The program calculates the cost for `n // 2` pairs, resulting in `n // 2 * b`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost calculated.

### Verification Using Annotated Code:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is more expensive than `b = 9`.
  - Output: `2 // 2 * 9 = 9` (correct because buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `9`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is more expensive than `b = 9`.
  - Output: `3 // 2 * 9 + 5 = 14` (correct because buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `14`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 11`.
  - Output: `3 * 5 = 15` (correct because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `15`

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 11`.
  - Output: `4 * 5 = 20` (correct because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `20`

### Conclusion:

The original assessment identified a logical error in the odd case where the program should always consider the promotion price for pairs and then add the cost of the single yogurt. However, upon closer inspection, the original program actually does this correctly. The conditions and calculations for both even and odd cases are logically sound and produce the correct minimum cost for the given test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original program is correct and does not need to be modified. It correctly handles both even and odd values of `n` and ensures the minimum cost is calculated for each test case.
