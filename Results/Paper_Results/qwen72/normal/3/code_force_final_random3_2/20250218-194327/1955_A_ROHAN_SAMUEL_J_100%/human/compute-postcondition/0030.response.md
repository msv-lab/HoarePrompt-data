To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are new integer values input by the user.
- The condition `2 * a < b` or `2 * a >= b` holds based on the new values of `a` and `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Values**:
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user.
   - The condition `2 * a < b` or `2 * a >= b` must be true for the given values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `n // 2`: This is the integer division of `n` by 2. It will result in the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`.
   - `b`: This is the integer value of `b` provided by the user.
   - `n // 2 * b`: This is the product of the integer division result and `b`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `n // 2 * b`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The output will be the result of the integer division of `n` by 2, multiplied by `b`.

Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n and b are the integer values input by the user)**
