The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
