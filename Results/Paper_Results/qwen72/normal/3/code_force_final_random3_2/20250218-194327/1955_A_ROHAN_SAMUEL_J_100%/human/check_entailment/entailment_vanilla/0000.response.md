### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it means buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper. The program calculates the cost for `n // 2` pairs and adds the cost of one additional yogurt (`a`), resulting in `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even, the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it means buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper. The program calculates the cost for `n // 2` pairs, resulting in `n // 2 * b`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost calculated.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 9`.
  - Output: `2 * 5 = 10` (but the correct output should be `9` because `b` is cheaper for two yogurts).
  - **Correct Output**: `9`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 9`.
  - Output: `3 * 5 = 15` (but the correct output should be `14` because buying two yogurts at `b` and one at `a` is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `14`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 11`.
  - Output: `3 * 5 = 15` (correct because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `15`

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` is cheaper than `b = 11`.
  - Output: `4 * 5 = 20` (correct because buying each yogurt individually is cheaper).
  - **Correct Output**: `20`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases where `n` is even and `n` is odd. However, there is a logical error in the odd case where it should always consider the promotion price for pairs and then add the cost of the single yogurt.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            print(n // 2 * b + a)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program does not always produce the correct minimum cost for odd values of `n`. The corrected program ensures that the promotion price is always considered for pairs, and the single yogurt is added separately if `n` is odd.
