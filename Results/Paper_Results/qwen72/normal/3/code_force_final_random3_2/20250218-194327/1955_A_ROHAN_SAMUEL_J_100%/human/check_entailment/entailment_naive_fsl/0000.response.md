Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts (b) is less than or equal to the regular price for two yogurts (2 * a) correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the total cost when the number of yogurts (n) is even and the promotion price (b) is less than the regular price for two yogurts (2 * a).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 5 9
```

The program should output 18, because the promotion price (9) is less than the regular price for two yogurts (10), and it is more cost-effective to buy two yogurts at a time using the promotion. However, the program outputs 20, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic for handling even numbers of yogurts. The program should always use the promotion price when it is cheaper, regardless of whether the number of yogurts is even or odd. The correct logic should be:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)
```

This ensures that the program always uses the cheaper option for buying yogurts, whether the number of yogurts is even or odd.
