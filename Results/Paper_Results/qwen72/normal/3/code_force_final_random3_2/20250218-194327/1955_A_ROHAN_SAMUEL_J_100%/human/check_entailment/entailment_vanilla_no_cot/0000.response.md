Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2` is true), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`) and then buys one additional yogurt at the regular price (`+ a`).

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even, the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

This logic ensures that the program always calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, considering both the regular and promotion prices. The program handles all the given test cases correctly and produces the expected output.
