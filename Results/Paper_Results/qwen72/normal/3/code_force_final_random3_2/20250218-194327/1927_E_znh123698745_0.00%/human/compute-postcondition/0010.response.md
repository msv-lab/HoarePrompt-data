Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[1]`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `i` is 1, and `((-1)` is incomplete.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value `array[1]` to the list `answer`.
- `a[0]` is 1, so `array[a[0]]` is `array[1]`.
- `answer` was initially `[1]`, and after appending `array[1]`, it becomes `[1, array[1]]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
