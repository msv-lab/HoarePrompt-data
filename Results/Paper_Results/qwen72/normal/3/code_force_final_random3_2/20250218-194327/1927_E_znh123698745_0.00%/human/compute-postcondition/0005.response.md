The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` will start at 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `i` is 1**
