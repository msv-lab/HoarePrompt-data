Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 1, `array[2]`, `array[3]`, ..., `array[n-2]`, `array[n-1]`, `array[1]`], and `a` is [n, -n].**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- **`n`**: Remains an integer greater than 1, as provided by the input.
- **`k`**: Remains an even integer, as provided by the input.
- **`_`**: Remains 2.
- **`array`**: Remains a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`answer`**: The list `answer` will contain the integers [1, 1, `array[2]`, `array[3]`, ..., `array[n-2]`, `array[n-1]`, `array[1]`]. This means the list starts with 1, followed by 1, and then alternates between elements from the end of `array` and elements from the beginning of `array`, excluding the first element (which is 1) and the last element (which is `n`).
- **`a`**: The list `a` will be [n, -n] after the loop completes. The first element of `a` will be `n` because it increments by 1 for each even `i`, and the second element of `a` will be `-n` because it decrements by 1 for each odd `i`.
