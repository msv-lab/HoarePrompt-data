Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided.
- The input values for `n` and `k` must still satisfy the conditions: 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ n, with `k` being an even integer.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `array`, `i`, `answer`, and `a`) remain unchanged, but `n` in their definitions is now the new value provided by the input.
