Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and 1, `a` is [1, -1]**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value of `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. Since `a[0]` is 1, and `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `array[1]` is 1. Therefore, `answer` now contains two 1s. The other variables remain unchanged.
