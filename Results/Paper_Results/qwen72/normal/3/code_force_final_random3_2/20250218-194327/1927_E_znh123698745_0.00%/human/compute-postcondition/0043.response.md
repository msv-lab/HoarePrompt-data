Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 2, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]` or the first element of `array`, and `array[a[0]]`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2 if `(-1)`**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value at the index `a[0]` of `array` to the list `answer`.
- `a[0]` is 1, so `array[a[0]]` is `array[1]`, which is the second element of `array`.
- The second element of `array` is 2 (since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive).
- Therefore, `answer` now contains the integers 1, `array[-1]` or the first element of `array`, and 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
