Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, `answer` is a list containing only the integer 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1.**

The code snippet `a = [1, -1]` updates the list `a` to contain the integers 1 and -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
