Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `n`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `(-1)` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`.
- The value of `a[-1]` is `-1`.
- The value of `array[-1]` is `n` because `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and the last element of the list is `n`.
- Therefore, `answer` now contains the integers 1 and `n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
