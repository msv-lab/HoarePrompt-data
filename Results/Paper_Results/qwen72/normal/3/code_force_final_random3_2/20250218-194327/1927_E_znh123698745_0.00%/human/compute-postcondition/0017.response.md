Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` contains the integer at the index `array[0]` of `array`, `array[0]` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `array[0]` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `_`, `i`, `answer`) remain unchanged.
- `answer` still contains the integer at the index `array[0]` of `array`, but now `array[0]` is 2.
