Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, `array`[-1]], `a` is [1, -1].**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`.
- `a[-1]` is `-1`, so `array[a[-1]]` is `array[-1]`, which is the last element of `array`.
- Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `array[-1]` is `n`.
- Therefore, `answer` is now a list containing the integers [1, `n`].
- All other variables remain unchanged.
