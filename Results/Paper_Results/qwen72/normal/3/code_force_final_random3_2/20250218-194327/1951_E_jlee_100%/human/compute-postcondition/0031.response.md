Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, and `x` is the first character of `s`. If `x` appears exactly `n` times in `s`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If the count of `x` in `s` is less than `n`, `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`. If the count of `x` in `s` is exactly `n - 1`, then either `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` is not equal to `x`, or `n` is even, or `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` is `x`.***
