Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
   - `string` is the new input string.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `count2` is greater than `count`.
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(string[:j], string[j:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `string[:j]` will print the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the index `j`.
   - `string[j:]` will print the substring of `string` from the index `j` to the end.
   - Given that `j` is 0, `string[:j]` will be an empty string (`""`).
   - `string[j:]` will be the entire string `string` because `j` is 0.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output an empty string followed by the entire input string `string`.

Output: **"" [string] (where [string] is the entire input string)**
