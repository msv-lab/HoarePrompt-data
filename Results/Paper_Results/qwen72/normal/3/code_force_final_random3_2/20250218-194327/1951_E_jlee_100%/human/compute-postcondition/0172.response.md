Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is the position of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if all characters are equal to `x`), `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first occurrence of a character not equal to `x` (or 0 if `count` is 0), and `done` is False. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `n` is even or the middle character of `s` is equal to `x`, the state of the variables also remains unchanged.***
