Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is 2, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
