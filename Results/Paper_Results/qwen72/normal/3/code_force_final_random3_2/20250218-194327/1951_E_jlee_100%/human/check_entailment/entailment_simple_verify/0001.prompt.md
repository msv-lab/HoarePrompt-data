You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: `t` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `t`, `i` is `t-1`, `s` is a list of characters from the last input string `string`, `string` is the last input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if all characters are equal to `x`), `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if `count` is 0), and `done` is False if none of the conditions for a 'YES' output were met in the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.
   - It checks if the length of the string `n` is 1. If so, it prints "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

2. **First Character and Last Character Check:**
   - If the first character `s[0]` is not equal to the last character `s[-1]`, the string is already non-palindromic, and the program prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

3. **All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same (i.e., `s.count(s[0]) == n`), the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, so the program prints "NO".

4. **Almost All Characters the Same:**
   - If all but one character in the string are the same (i.e., `s.count(s[0]) == n - 1`), the program checks if the string length is odd and the middle character is different from the rest. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

5. **General Case:**
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first pair of characters that are not equal.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.
   - If no such pair is found, it attempts to find a valid partition by checking for the first and second different characters.
   - If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" with the partition.
   - If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:

- **Single Character String:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the string has only one character by printing "NO".

- **Non-Palindromic String:**
  - The program correctly identifies if the string is already non-palindromic and prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

- **All Characters the Same:**
  - The program correctly identifies if all characters in the string are the same and prints "NO".

- **Almost All Characters the Same:**
  - The program correctly identifies if all but one character are the same and prints "NO" if the string length is odd and the middle character is different. Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.

- **General Case:**
  - The program attempts to find a valid partition by iterating through the string and checking for the first pair of characters that are not equal.
  - If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" with the entire string as the partition.
  - If no such pair is found, it attempts to find a valid partition by checking for the first and second different characters.
  - If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" with the partition.
  - If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It checks for the conditions and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
