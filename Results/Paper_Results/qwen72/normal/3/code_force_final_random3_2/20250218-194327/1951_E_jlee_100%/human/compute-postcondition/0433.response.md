Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 2, `count2` is either 2 or greater than `count` (where `count` is set to 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged), `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.**
