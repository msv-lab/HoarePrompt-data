Based on the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
- `string` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s`.
- `done` is False.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `x` appears exactly `n` times in the list `s`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the string `'NO'` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided.

Output: **NO**
