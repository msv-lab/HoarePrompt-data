Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1, `count2` is either 1 or greater than `count`, and `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1, `count2` is either 2 or greater than `count`, and `done` is True, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is not less than 1, `count` remains unchanged, `count2` is 1, and `done` is False if the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
