Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
- `string` is the new input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` remains unchanged and `done` remains unchanged.
- If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1 and `done` remains unchanged.
- If `count` is less than or equal to 0, `count2` remains unchanged and if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is False; otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned.

Output: **YES**
