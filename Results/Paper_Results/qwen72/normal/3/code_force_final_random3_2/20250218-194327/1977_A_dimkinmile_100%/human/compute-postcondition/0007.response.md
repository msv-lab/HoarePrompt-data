Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the user input, where both `n` and `m` are expected to be within the range 1 to 100. The function then checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is a non-negative even number. If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The final state of the program is that the values of `n` and `m` are unchanged, and the output is either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition. **
