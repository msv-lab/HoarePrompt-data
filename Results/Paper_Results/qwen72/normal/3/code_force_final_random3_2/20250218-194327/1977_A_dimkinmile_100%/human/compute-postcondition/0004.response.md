Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `m` are specific integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- Additionally, either (n - m) is not divisible by 2, or n - m is less than 0.

Given these conditions, the code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

The `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n`, `m`, or `t`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
