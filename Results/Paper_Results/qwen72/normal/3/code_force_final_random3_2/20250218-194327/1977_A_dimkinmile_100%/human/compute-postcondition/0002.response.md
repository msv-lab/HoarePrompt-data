Based on the initial state, we know that `n` and `m` are specific integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Additionally, the difference between `n` and `m` is a non-negative even number.

The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('Yes')
```

This code snippet does not depend on the values of `n`, `m`, or `t`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
