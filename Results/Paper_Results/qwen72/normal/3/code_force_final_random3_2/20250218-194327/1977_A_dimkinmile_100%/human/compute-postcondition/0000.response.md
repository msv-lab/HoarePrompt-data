The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes an input string, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will be updated to the specific integer values provided by the input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are specific integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**
