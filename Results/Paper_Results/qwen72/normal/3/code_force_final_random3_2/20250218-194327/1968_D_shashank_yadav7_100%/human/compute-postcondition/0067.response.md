Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in `a`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k - 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k - 1)`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, where `p[b]` is the value at index `b` in the list `p`.
- All other variables remain unchanged or retain their previous conditions.
- The specific values of `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k` are not altered, but `b` is now `p[b] - 1`.
- The conditions for `k` and the breaking out of the loop or if statement if `k` is 0 are still valid.
