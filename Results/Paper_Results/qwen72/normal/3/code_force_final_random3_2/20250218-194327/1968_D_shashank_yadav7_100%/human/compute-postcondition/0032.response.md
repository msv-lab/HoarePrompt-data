The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer minus 2, `b` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `p` minus 1, `s` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `p` minus 1, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` value and the value of `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` value and the value of `a[s] * k + sp`**
