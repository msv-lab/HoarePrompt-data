The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in `a`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`**
