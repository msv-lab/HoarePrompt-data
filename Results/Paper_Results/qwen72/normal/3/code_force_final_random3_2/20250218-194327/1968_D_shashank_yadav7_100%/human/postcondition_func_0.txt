The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` (where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), the second line contains `n` integers `p_1, ..., p_n` (where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and the third line contains `n` integers `a_1, ..., a_n` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case by adjusting the values of `b` and `s` based on the `p` list and calculates the maximum possible values of two expressions involving elements from the `a` list. After processing, it prints 'Bodya' if the first expression is greater, 'Sasha' if the second expression is greater, or 'Draw' if they are equal. The function continues processing until all test cases are completed.
