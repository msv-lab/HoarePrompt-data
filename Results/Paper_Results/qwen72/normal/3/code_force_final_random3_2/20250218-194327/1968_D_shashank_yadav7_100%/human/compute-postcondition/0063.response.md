Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in `a`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k - 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decremented by 1, so `k` is now `k - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `a`, and `p` remain unchanged.
- `sp` and `bp` are still the values at indices `s` and `b` in the list `a`, respectively.
- `bm` and `sm` are now calculated using the updated value of `k`, which is `k - 1`. Therefore, `bm` is `a[b] * (k - 1)` and `sm` is `a[s] * (k - 1)`.
