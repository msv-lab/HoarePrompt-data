Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer minus 1, `b` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `p` minus 1, `s` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `p` minus 1, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` value and the value of `a[b] * k + bp`**. 

If `k` is 0, `bm` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the value of `a[b] * k + bp`.
