Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1` if `k` was greater than 0 initially and the loop executed fully, otherwise `i` is the value at the time `k` became 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the loop executed fully or the value at the time `k` became 0, `b` is the final value of `b` after `b = p[b] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, `s` is the final value of `s` after `s = p[s] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the sum of the initial `sp` and all values of `a[s]` added during the loop, `bp` is the sum of the initial `bp` and all values of `a[b]` added during the loop, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` computed during the loop, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` computed during the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- `t` remains the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is the loop counter and will be `n - 1` if the loop executed fully without `k` becoming 0, otherwise it will be the value at the time `k` became 0.
- `n` remains the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `k` will be 0 if the loop executed fully or if it was decremented to 0 during the loop.
- `b` will be the final value after the loop has repeatedly updated `b` using `b = p[b] - 1`.
- `s` will be the final value after the loop has repeatedly updated `s` using `s = p[s] - 1`.
- `a` and `p` remain unchanged as they are input lists.
- `sp` will be the sum of the initial `sp` and all values of `a[s]` added during the loop.
- `bp` will be the sum of the initial `bp` and all values of `a[b]` added during the loop.
- `bm` will be the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` computed during the loop.
- `sm` will be the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` computed during the loop.
