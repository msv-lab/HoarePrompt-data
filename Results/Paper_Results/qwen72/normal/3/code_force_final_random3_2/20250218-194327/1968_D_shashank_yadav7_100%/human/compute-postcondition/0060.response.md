Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in `a`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part.**
