Output State: **`input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `4 + 3 * n`, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2 * n]`, `a` is updated to a list of `n` integers starting from `data[idx]` to `data[idx + n - 1]`, and `results` now contains an additional element which is the result of `func_1(n, a)`.**
