Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is 1, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
    idx += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[2]` to `data[2 + n - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `3 + 2 * n`, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[3 + n]` to `data[3 + 2 * n - 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `4 + 3 * n`, `t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2 * n]`, `a` is updated to a list of `n` integers starting from `data[idx]` to `data[idx + n - 1]`, and `results` now contains an additional element which is the result of `func_1(n, a)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
