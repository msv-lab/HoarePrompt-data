The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in `a` is between 1 and `n` and appears at most twice. It returns the minimum value between the number of integers in `a` that appear exactly twice and half of `n`. After the function concludes, the input parameters `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the function does not modify any external state.
