### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given the cards in your hand.
   - **Behavior:** It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. It then calculates the number of pairs (integers that appear exactly twice) and returns the minimum of this count and `n // 2`.
   - **Correctness:** The function correctly identifies the number of pairs in your hand. Since Nene plays optimally, she will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours. Therefore, the maximum number of points you can get is the number of pairs you have, but you can only score points for up to half of the total turns (i.e., `n // 2`), because Nene will play her cards to counter your pairs. This logic is sound and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** This function reads multiple test cases from `stdin`, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results to `stdout`.
   - **Behavior:** It reads the entire input at once, splits it into a list of strings, and processes each test case by extracting `n` and `a` from the list. It then calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result.
   - **Correctness:** The function correctly handles multiple test cases and processes the input and output as described in the problem. It ensures that the input is read and split correctly, and it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters for each test case. The results are collected and printed in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
- **Function `func_1`** is correct in its logic and implementation.
- **Function `func_2`** correctly reads and processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` appropriately and printing the results.

Since both functions are correct and work together to solve the problem as described, the overall program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
