The function `func_2` reads input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function calls `func_1` for each test case, passing `n` and `a` as arguments, and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result to `stdout`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `input` is a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read from `stdin`, `idx` is `1 + (t * (n + 1))`, `t` is 0, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case.
