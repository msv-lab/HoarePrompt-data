### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game is played with 2n cards, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - You and Nene each receive n cards.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - You should try to score points by playing a card that matches a card already on the table.
   - Nene, being optimal, will always play a card that does not match any card on the table if possible, to avoid giving you points.

3. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of cards `n` and the list of cards in your hand `a`.
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of cards you have (i.e., cards that appear twice in your hand).
   - The function returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. This is because you can only score points for up to `n // 2` pairs, as Nene will always play optimally to avoid giving you more points.

4. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input data.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of cards in your hand `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the maximum number of points you can score for that test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

5. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read in bulk using `sys.stdin.read` and split into a list of strings.
   - The index `idx` is used to traverse this list and extract the necessary data for each test case.
   - The output is printed for each test case after all test cases have been processed.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `n` is 1, which is the smallest possible value.
   - It also handles the case where you have no pairs in your hand, returning 0 as expected.

### Correctness:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct because it correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting the pairs in your hand and ensuring you can only score up to `n // 2` points.
- The logic in `func_2` is correct because it properly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
