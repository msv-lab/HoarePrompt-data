### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, you and Nene, each starting with `n` cards.
   - Each card has an integer from 1 to `n`, and each integer appears exactly twice in the deck.
   - The goal is to maximize your score by playing cards optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function takes `n` and a list `a` of integers representing the cards in your hand.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It calculates the number of pairs (integers that appear exactly twice) in your hand.
   - The function returns the minimum value between the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

   **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The number of pairs in your hand represents the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally.
   - Since Nene plays optimally, she will always try to score points on her turn if possible.
   - The `min(pairs, n // 2)` ensures that you cannot score more points than the number of pairs you have, and also that you cannot score more than half of the total turns you have (since each pair can only be scored once).

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from `stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` to compute the maximum number of points you can score for that test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.

   **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - It prints the results in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score in the card game, given the constraints and the optimal play by Nene. Both functions are implemented correctly and handle the input and output as expected.

### Correctness:
**True**
