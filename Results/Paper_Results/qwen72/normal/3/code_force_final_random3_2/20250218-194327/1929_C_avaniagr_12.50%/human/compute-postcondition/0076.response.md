Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. If `x` == `k - 1`, there are no changes to `a`. Otherwise, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `z` is the sum of 1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1 repeated `x + 1` times, and `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.***
