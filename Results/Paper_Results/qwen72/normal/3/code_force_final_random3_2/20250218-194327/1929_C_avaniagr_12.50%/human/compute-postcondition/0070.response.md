Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `z` is the sum of 1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1 repeated `x + 1` times, `i` is `x`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial state of the loop includes the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, with `t` being an integer between 1 and 1000, `k` and `x` being input integers, and `a` being an input integer. The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, and the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than the new value of `_`.
- The loop runs `x + 1` times, and in each iteration, the variable `z` is updated by adding 1 to the result of `z // (k - 1)`.
- After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `z` will be the sum of the expression `1 + (1 // (k - 1)) + (1 + (1 // (k - 1))) // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x + 1` times.
- The loop counter `i` will have the value `x` after the loop finishes.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial values.
