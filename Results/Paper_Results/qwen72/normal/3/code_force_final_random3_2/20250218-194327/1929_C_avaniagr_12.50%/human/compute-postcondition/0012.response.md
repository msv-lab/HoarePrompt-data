The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k` is an integer.
- `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, which means `a` is greater than or equal to `k + 2`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, it will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
