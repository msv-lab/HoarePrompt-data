Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x` < `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` >= `k - 1`, then if `x` == `k - 1`, if `a` is greater than or equal to `k + 2`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `i` is set to `x` and `z` is set to `x + 1`. In both cases, the function performs operations based on the value of `a` relative to `z`, but `i` remains `x` and `z` remains `x + 1`.***
