The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the expression `x + 1`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must still be at least 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `z` is 1, `i` is 1**
