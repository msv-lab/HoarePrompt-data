Let's analyze the given precondition and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.
- `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Counter `_`**: The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1. This means that after the increment, `_` will have a new value, which is 1 more than its previous value.
2. **Condition `t > _`**: The condition `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` is given. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `_` is incremented by 1, the new value of `_` will be at least 1. Therefore, `t` will always be greater than `_` as long as `t` is at least 2.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will print the string 'YES' because the condition `t > _` is satisfied as long as `t` is at least 2, which is within the given range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

Output: **YES**
