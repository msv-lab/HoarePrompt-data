The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the expression `x + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x + 1` must still be greater than `i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `x + 1` is greater than 0

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to 1
- `x + 1` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`i` is 1, `x + 1` is greater than 1, `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**
