The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal provided.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides the following variables and conditions:
   - `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - The number of occurrences of '1' in `a` is 0.

2. The `print` statement is:
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
