The given `print` statement is `print('NO')`. This statement prints the string `'NO'` to the console. The initial state of the program, which includes the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `a`, and the conditions on `count`, does not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is simply printing a constant string.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **NO**
