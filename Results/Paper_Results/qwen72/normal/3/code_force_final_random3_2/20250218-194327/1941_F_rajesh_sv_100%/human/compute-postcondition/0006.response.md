Initial State: `testcases` must be greater than 1, `_` is a dummy variable
```
func_6()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The function `func_6()` is called, but since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the program state. However, we can assume that it does not affect the variables `testcases` or `_` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Output State: **`testcases` must be greater than 1, `_` is a dummy variable, and `func_6()` has been called.**
