The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `testcases`. For the loop to execute, `testcases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `testcases` must be such that it ensures the loop will run at least once.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0, `_` is a dummy variable**
