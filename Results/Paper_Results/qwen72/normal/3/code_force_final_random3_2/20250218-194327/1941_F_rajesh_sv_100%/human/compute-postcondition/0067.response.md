Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value `max_diff` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the first value in `F`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, and `l` must be less than `h`. The other variables (`A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) retain their values from the initial state.**

Explanation:
- `mid_sum` is assigned the value `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is assigned the value `D[mid + 1] + f`.
- All other variables retain their values from the initial state.
