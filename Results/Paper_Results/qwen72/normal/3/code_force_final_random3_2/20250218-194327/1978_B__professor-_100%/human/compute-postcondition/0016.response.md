Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned integer values from the input.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is incremented to the next value in the sequence.

### Print Statement:
```
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Calculate `b - a`**:
   - This is the difference between the integers `b` and `a`.

2. **Calculate `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`**:
   - This is the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers. The formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \).
   - Here, `k` is `b - a`.

3. **Calculate `a * n`**:
   - This is the product of the integer `a` and the integer `n`.

4. **Combine the results**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
   - This means we first compute the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers, then add the product of `a` and `n`, and finally convert the result to an integer.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer value of the expression \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n\).

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated integer value.

Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n) (where `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integer values assigned from the input)**
