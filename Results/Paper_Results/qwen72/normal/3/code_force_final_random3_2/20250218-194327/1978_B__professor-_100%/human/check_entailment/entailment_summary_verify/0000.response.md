### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit is calculated as `n * a`.
     - This is correct because selling at the usual price `a` will always yield at least as much profit as selling at the modified price `b`.

   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit is calculated as `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
     - This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - n + 1`. The sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
       \[
       S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d)
       \]
       Here, \(a = b\) and \(d = -1\), so the sum becomes:
       \[
       S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (2b - (n-1)) = \frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)
       \]
       This is correct and matches the formula used in the program.

   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit is calculated as `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
     - This formula is derived by summing the profit from the first `b - a` buns sold at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns sold at the usual price:
       \[
       \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=1}^{b-a} (b - i + 1) + a \times (n - (b - a))
       \]
       The sum of the first `b - a` terms of the series is:
       \[
       \sum_{i=1}^{b-a} (b - i + 1) = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}
       \]
       Adding the profit from the remaining buns:
       \[
       \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a))
       \]
       This matches the formula used in the program.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n`, `a`, and `b` are at their minimum and maximum values (1 and 10^9).
   - For example, when `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, and `b = 10^9`, the profit is `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`, which is correctly calculated.
   - When `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, and `b = 1`, the profit is `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`, which is also correctly calculated.

4. **General Correctness:**
   - The program correctly identifies the optimal strategy for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - The calculations for the profit in each case are mathematically sound and match the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all potential cases and edge cases as described in the problem statement. The logic and calculations are correct and match the expected behavior.

Final: **True**
