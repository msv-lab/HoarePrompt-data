To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` function step by step based on the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned integer values from the input.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is incremented to the next value in the sequence.

The `print` statement is:
```
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. **Calculate `2 * b`**:
   - This is simply twice the value of `b`.

2. **Subtract `n` from `2 * b`**:
   - This gives us `2 * b - n`.

3. **Add 1 to the result**:
   - This gives us `2 * b - n + 1`.

4. **Multiply the result by `n`**:
   - This gives us `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`.

5. **Perform integer division by 2**:
   - This gives us `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

6. **Convert the result to an integer**:
   - The `int` function is used to ensure the result is an integer, but since we are already performing integer division, this step is redundant.

So, the final value printed will be the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 (where `n` and `b` are the integer values assigned from the input)**
