Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum profit when `b > a` and `b - a < n` is incorrect. The program incorrectly calculates the profit as `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`, which does not account for the correct number of buns sold at the modified price.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(n, b)
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a
            print(profit)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Explanation:
1. If `b <= a`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`, so the profit is `n * a`.
2. If `b > a`, the optimal strategy is to sell the first `k` buns at the modified price, where `k = min(n, b)`. The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of the series `(b + (b - 1) + (b - 2) + ... + (b - k + 1))`, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
3. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The corrected program ensures that the profit is calculated correctly in all scenarios.
