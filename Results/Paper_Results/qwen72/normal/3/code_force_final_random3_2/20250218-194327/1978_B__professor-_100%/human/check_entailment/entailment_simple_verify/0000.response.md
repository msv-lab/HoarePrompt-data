### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the problem description to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`:
     - `n`: Number of buns.
     - `a`: Usual price of a bun.
     - `b`: Price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

3. **Promotion Rules:**
   - Bob can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)).
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price of `(b - i + 1)` for the `i`-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k).
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If `b ≤ a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - If `b - a ≥ n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
   - If `b - a < n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditional Logic:**
   - **Case 1: `b ≤ a`**
     - The program prints `n * a`.
     - This is correct because if the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - **Case 2: `b - a ≥ n`**
     - The program prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
     - This formula calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - The sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by `S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)`, where `a` is the first term and `d` is the common difference.
     - Here, `a = b` and `d = -1`, so the formula simplifies to `S = n/2 * (2b - (n-1)) = n/2 * (2b - n + 1)`.
     - This is correct because it calculates the total profit from selling the first `n` buns at the modified price.
   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - The program prints `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
     - This formula calculates the profit from selling the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time is `S = (b - a)/2 * (2b - (b - a - 1)) = (b - a)/2 * (b - a + 1)`.
     - The profit from the remaining buns is `(n - (b - a)) * a`.
     - The total profit is `S + (n - (b - a)) * a = (b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.
     - This is correct because it accurately calculates the total profit by combining the profit from the modified price and the usual price.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function should accept three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`.
  - The function does not accept parameters but reads them from input, which is a minor deviation but does not affect the correctness of the logic.

- **State after reading input:**
  - `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input.
  - `t` is the number of test cases.

- **State after the loop:**
  - The loop has completed all iterations.
  - No changes are made to `n`, `a`, or `b` during each iteration, which is expected as they are read for each test case.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The logic for each case is sound and the calculations are accurate. The program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case and outputs the results as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
