Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values from the input, and `t` is greater than 0. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made to `n`, `a`, or `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n`, or `b - a` is less than `n`.***
