To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the expression step by step based on the initial state provided:

Initial State:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned values from the input.
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the `print` statement, so it is irrelevant for this task).
- `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. **Calculate the difference `b - a`:**
   - Since `b` is greater than `a`, `b - a` is a positive integer.
   - Let's denote this difference as `d`, so `d = b - a`.

2. **Calculate the term `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`:**
   - This term is the sum of the first `d` natural numbers, which can be derived from the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - The formula for the sum of the first `d` natural numbers is \(\frac{d(d + 1)}{2}\).
   - Therefore, \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2\) is the integer division of \(\frac{d(d + 1)}{2}\).

3. **Calculate the term `a * n`:**
   - This term is simply the product of `a` and `n`.

4. **Combine the terms:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is the sum of the two terms calculated above: \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n\).

5. **Convert the result to an integer:**
   - The `int` function is used to ensure the result is an integer, but since the expression already involves integer operations, this conversion is redundant.

Now, let's put it all together:

The `print` statement will output the integer value of the expression \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n\).

Given the initial state:
- `d = b - a` (where `d` is a positive integer and `d < n`).
- The term \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2\) is the sum of the first `d` natural numbers.
- The term `a * n` is the product of `a` and `n`.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **\((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n\) (where \(b - a\) is the difference between `b` and `a`, and `a * n` is the product of `a` and `n`)**
