Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input, `t` is greater than 2, and `_` is 2. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged.***
