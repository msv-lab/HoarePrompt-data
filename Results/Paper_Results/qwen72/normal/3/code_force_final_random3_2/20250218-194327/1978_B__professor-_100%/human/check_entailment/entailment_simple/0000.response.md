### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Logic for Maximum Profit**:
   - **Case 1**: If `b <= a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price is not beneficial. The profit is simply `n * a`.
   - **Case 2**: If `b - a >= n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price. The profit is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series: `n * (2 * b - n + 1) // 2`.
   - **Case 3**: If `b - a < n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`. The profit from the modified price buns is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `a + 1`, which is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`. The profit from the remaining buns is `a * (n - (b - a))`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Verification of Logic:

- **Case 1**: If `b <= a`, the profit is `n * a`. This is correct because selling at the usual price is the best option.
- **Case 2**: If `b - a >= n`, the profit is `n * (2 * b - n + 1) // 2`. This is correct because it calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b`.
- **Case 3**: If `b - a < n`, the profit is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * (n - (b - a))`. This is correct because it calculates the sum of the modified price buns and adds the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - `b > a` and `b - a < n` (5 - 4 = 1 < 4)
  - Profit = `1 * (1 + 1) // 2 + 4 * (4 - 1) = 1 + 12 = 17`
  - Correct output: `17`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `b > a` and `b - a >= n` (9 - 5 = 4 >= 5)
  - Profit = `5 * (2 * 9 - 5 + 1) // 2 = 5 * 14 // 2 = 35`
  - Correct output: `35`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - `b <= a`
  - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
  - Correct output: `100`

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `b > a` and `b - a >= n` (11 - 5 = 6 >= 5)
  - Profit = `5 * (2 * 11 - 5 + 1) // 2 = 5 * 18 // 2 = 45`
  - Correct output: `45`

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
  - `b <= a`
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Correct output: `1000000000000000000`

- **Test Case 6**: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
  - `b <= a`
  - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Correct output: `1000000000000000000`

- **Test Case 7**: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
  - `b > a` and `b - a >= n` (1000 - 1 = 999 >= 1000)
  - Profit = `1000 * (2 * 1000 - 1000 + 1) // 2 = 1000 * 1001 // 2 = 500500`
  - Correct output: `500500`
