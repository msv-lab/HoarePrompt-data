Output State: **`vx` is a set containing the last two integers that were not removed during the loop iterations. `ops` is a list containing tuples representing the operations performed during the loop. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- `p1` is updated to be a list containing the two integers from the set `vx`.
- `p2` is initialized as an empty list.
- The values of `vx` and `ops` remain unchanged.
