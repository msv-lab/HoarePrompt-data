Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is a list containing tuples based on the value of `v2` for each iteration, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The set `vx` remains unchanged and still contains exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive.
- The list `ops` remains unchanged and still contains the tuples based on the value of `v2` for each iteration.
- The list `p1` will contain the two integers from `vx` and any `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was not equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration.
- The list `p2` will contain any `v1` values from the tuples in `ops` where the last element of `p1` was equal to `v2` at the start of the iteration.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 1 still holds.
