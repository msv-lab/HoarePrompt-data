Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2` and `v3`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is `len(vx) - 1`, `v2` is `0`, `v3` has been removed from `vx`.**

Explanation:
- `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
- The values of `v3` and `v1` are used in the tuples, where `v1` is `len(vx) - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
