Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for the value `len(vx) - 2`, `ops` is an empty list, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is `len(vx) - 1`, `v2` is `0`, `v3` is the first element returned by the function `q(0)`.**

Explanation:
- The function `q(0)` is called, and it returns a tuple. The first element of this tuple is assigned to `v3`, and the second element is discarded (indicated by `_`).
- The values of `vx`, `ops`, `int(input())`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
- `v3` is now the first element returned by `q(0)`. The specific value of `v3` depends on the implementation of the function `q`, but it is included in the output state as the first element of the tuple returned by `q(0)`.
