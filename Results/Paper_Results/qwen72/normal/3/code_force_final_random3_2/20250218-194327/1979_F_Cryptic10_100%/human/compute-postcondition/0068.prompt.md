Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`vx` is a set containing more than 1 integer from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for `v1`. `ops` is a list. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, where `v3` is the first integer from the set `vx` and `_` is the second integer from the set `vx`. `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`. `int(input())` must be greater than 1. `v1` and `v2` are the result of `q(len(vx) - 2)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for `v1` and `v2`. `ops` is a list that contains tuples based on the value of `v2`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, where `v3` is the first integer from the set `vx` and `_` is the second integer from the set `vx`, and `v3` is removed from `vx`. `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`. `int(input())` must be greater than 1. `v1` and `v2` are the result of `q(len(vx) - 2)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for `v1` and `v2`, and `vx` must have at least 3 elements. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` appended to its previous contents, and `v1` is removed from `vx`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is the first integer from the set `vx`, `_` is the second integer from the set `vx`, `v3` is removed from `vx`, `ops` now includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` in addition to its previous contents, and `v1` is removed from `vx`. In both cases, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, and `vx` has at least 1 element.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
