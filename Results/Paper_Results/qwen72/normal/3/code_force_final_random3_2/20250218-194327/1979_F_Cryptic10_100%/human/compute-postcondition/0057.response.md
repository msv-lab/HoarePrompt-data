Output State: **`v3` is removed from the set `vx`, `vx` is a set containing more than 0 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`. `ops` is a list. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` â‰¤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`. `int(input())` must be greater than 1. `v1` and `v2` are the result of `q(len(vx) - 2)`.**
