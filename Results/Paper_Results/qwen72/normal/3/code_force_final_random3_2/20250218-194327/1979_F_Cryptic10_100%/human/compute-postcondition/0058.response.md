Output State: **`v3` is removed from the set `vx`, `vx` is a set containing more than 0 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())` inclusive, except for `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`. `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` and the new tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` have been appended to `ops`. `p1` is a list containing all integers from the set `vx` plus any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`. `int(input())` must be greater than 1. `v1` and `v2` are the result of `q(len(vx) - 2)`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `ops` contains different tuples based on the value of `v2`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` â‰¤ 0, `ops` contains `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.
- The code snippet `ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` appends the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` to the list `ops`.
- Therefore, regardless of the initial condition of `v2`, the list `ops` now contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` appended to its original content.
- The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `vx` remain unchanged.
- The lists `p1` and `p2` are not directly affected by the code snippet, so their conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
