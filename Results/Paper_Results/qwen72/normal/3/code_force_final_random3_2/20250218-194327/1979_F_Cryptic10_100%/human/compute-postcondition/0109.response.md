Output State: **`vx` is a set containing the last two integers that were not removed during the loop iterations, `ops` is a list containing tuples representing the operations performed during the loop that must have at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`, `p2` is a list that may contain one element if `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, otherwise `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` plus `v1`, `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.
- If `p1[-1]` (the last element of `p1`) is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.
- If `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- The values of `vx`, `ops`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
- The state of `p2` is updated only if the condition `p1[-1] == v2` is true.
- The state of `p1` is updated by appending `v1` if the condition `p1[-1] == v2` is false.
