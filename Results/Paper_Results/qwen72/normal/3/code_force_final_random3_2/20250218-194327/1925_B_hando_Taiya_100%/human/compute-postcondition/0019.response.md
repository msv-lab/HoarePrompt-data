Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer provided by the input and 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 3. If `n` <= `x // i` and `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` <= 3, then `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
