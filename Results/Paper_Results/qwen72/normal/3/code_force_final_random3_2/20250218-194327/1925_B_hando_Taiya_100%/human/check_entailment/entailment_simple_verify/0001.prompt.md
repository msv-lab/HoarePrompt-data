You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer provided by the input and 1 <= n <= x, `i` is the largest integer such that `i * i <= x`. If `x` is divisible by any integer `i` in the range 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`, and if `n` <= `x // i` or `n` <= `i`, then `ans` is the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies these conditions. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.
    #   - If the conditions are met, `ans` will be the maximum value of `i` or \(\frac{x}{i}\) that satisfies the conditions.
    #   - If the conditions are not met, `ans` will be 0.
    #
    #Based on the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`.
   - The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
   - The sub-problems must have positive integer difficulties.

2. **Approach**:
   - The GCD of `n` numbers is maximized when all the numbers are equal. Therefore, the optimal way to break `x` into `n` sub-problems is to make all sub-problems have the same difficulty.
   - If `x` is divisible by `n`, then the maximum balance is `x // n`.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a divisor and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - If `i` is a divisor and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach of iterating over divisors of `x` is correct because the GCD of the sub-problems must be a divisor of `x`.
   - The condition `n <= x // i` ensures that we can split `x` into `n` sub-problems with each having a difficulty of `i`.
   - The condition `n <= i` ensures that we can split `x` into `n` sub-problems with each having a difficulty of `x // i`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `x` is divisible by `n` correctly.
   - The code also handles the case where `x` is not divisible by `n` by finding the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to split `x` into `n` sub-problems.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The code is efficient because it only iterates up to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for finding divisors.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
