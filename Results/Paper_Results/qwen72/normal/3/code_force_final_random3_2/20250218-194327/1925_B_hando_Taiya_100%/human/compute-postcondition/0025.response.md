The function `func_1` does not explicitly show the parameters it accepts in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, we can infer that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.

Since the output is not provided, we cannot determine the specific return value of the function. However, we can describe the parameters the function accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 1 and 100,000,000 (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` (inclusive).**
