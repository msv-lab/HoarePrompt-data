The loop head involves the variables `i` and `x`, and the function `isqrt(x)` which is called to determine the upper limit of the loop. The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, starting from 1 and ending at `isqrt(x) + 1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `isqrt(x) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer provided by the input and 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), and if `n` <= `i`, then `ans` is the maximum value between 1 and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `ans` remains 0.**
