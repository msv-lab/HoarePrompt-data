Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer provided by the input and 1 <= n <= x, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.**
