Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer provided by the input and 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by 3 and `n` <= 3, then `ans` is the maximum value between 0, 1, `x // 3`, and 3. If `x` is divisible by 3 but `n` > 3, `ans` remains 0. If `x` is not divisible by 3, `ans` remains 0.***
