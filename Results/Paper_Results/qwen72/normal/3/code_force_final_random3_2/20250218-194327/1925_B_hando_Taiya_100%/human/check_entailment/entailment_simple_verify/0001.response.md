### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`.
   - The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
   - The sub-problems must have positive integer difficulties.

2. **Approach**:
   - The optimal way to break `x` into `n` sub-problems is to make all sub-problems have the same difficulty, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`.
   - If `x` is divisible by `n`, then the maximum balance is `x // n`.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to split `x` into `n` sub-problems.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a divisor and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - If `i` is a divisor and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach of iterating over divisors of `x` is correct because the GCD of the sub-problems must be a divisor of `x`.
   - The condition `n <= x // i` ensures that we can split `x` into `n` sub-problems with each having a difficulty of `i`.
   - The condition `n <= i` ensures that we can split `x` into `n` sub-problems with each having a difficulty of `x // i`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `x` is divisible by `n` correctly.
   - The code also handles the case where `x` is not divisible by `n` by finding the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to split `x` into `n` sub-problems.
   - The code correctly handles the edge case where `n` is equal to `x` (each sub-problem has a difficulty of 1).

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The code is efficient because it only iterates up to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for finding divisors.
   - The time complexity is \(O(\sqrt{x})\) for each test case, which is feasible given the constraints.
