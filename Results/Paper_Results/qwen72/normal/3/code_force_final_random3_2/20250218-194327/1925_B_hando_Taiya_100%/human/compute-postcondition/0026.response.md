Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. It then calculates the maximum integer `i` such that `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to either `i` or `x // i`. The function prints this maximum value if it exists; otherwise, it prints 0. The function does not return any value. **
