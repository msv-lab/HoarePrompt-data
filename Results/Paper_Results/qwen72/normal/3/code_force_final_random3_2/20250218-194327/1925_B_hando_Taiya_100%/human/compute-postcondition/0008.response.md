Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer provided by the input and 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), `ans` is the maximum value between 1 and `x // 1` (which is `x`).**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `ans` is 1.
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value (1) and the result of `x // i`.
- Since `i` is 1, `x // i` is equal to `x`.
- Therefore, `ans` is updated to `x` because `x` is always greater than or equal to 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
