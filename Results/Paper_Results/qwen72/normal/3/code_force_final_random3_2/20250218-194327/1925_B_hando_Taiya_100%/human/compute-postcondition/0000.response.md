Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, and 1 <= n <= x.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. The previous value of `t` remains unchanged, and the new values of `x` and `n` are determined by the input. The condition 1 <= n <= x still holds true as it is part of the input constraints.
