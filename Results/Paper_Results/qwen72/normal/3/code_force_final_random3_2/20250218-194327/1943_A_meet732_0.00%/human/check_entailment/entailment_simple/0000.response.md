### Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates over the elements of `a` and increments the corresponding index in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX:**
   - The program checks if `cntl[0]` is 0. If it is, the MEX is 0 because 0 is not in the array `a`, and the program prints 0 and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because if 0 is not in the array, it is the smallest non-negative integer not present, making the MEX 0.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can pick at most two 0s if they are available.
   - The program then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` to find the smallest index `j` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
   - For each such index `j`, it decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0 or if `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the MEX, and Bob's goal is to minimize it.
   - By picking elements optimally, Alice will try to ensure that the smallest non-negative integers are not in `c` as much as possible, while Bob will try to include them.
   - The logic of the program ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the counts of each element and stopping at the first index where the count is less than 2, which is the correct approach to determine the MEX.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `cntl[0]` is 0 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all elements from 0 to `n-1` are present in `a` by printing `n` when `j` reaches `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. It processes the input correctly, counts the elements, and applies the optimal strategy for both players.
