Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. If the first element of `cntl` is 0, the program retains all variables as they are. If the first element of `cntl` is not 0, `j` is the smallest index in the range 1 to `n` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists, and `c` is 0 if `j` is less than `n` and `cntl[j]` is less than 2, otherwise `c` is the minimum of 2 and the first element of `cntl`.***
