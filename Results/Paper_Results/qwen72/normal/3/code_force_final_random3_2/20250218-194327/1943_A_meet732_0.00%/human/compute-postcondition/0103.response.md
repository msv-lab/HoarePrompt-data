The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3**
