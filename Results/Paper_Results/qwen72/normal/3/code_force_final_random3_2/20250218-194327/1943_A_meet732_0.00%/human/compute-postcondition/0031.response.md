Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`.
   - The first element of `cntl` is not 0.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `c` is the minimum of 1 and the first element of `cntl` minus 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly defined as 3.
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `j`.

Since `j` is explicitly defined as 3, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **3**
