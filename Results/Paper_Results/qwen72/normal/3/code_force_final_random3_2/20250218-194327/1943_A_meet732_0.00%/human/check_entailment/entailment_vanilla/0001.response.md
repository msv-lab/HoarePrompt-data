### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array `a` and increments the count of each element in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - The program checks if the count of `0` in `cntl` is `0`. If so, it prints `0` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if `0` is not in the array, the MEX of the final array `c` will be `0`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program initializes a variable `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is because Alice can pick at most two `0`s to maximize the score, and Bob can pick at most one `0` to minimize the score.
   - The program then iterates through the elements from `1` to `n`:
     - If the count of the current element `j` is less than `2`, it means that Bob can pick this element to prevent Alice from picking it twice.
     - The program decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if `j` is the last element. If either condition is true, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct MEX value for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the case where `0` is not in the array.
- The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element and uses this information to determine the optimal moves for Alice and Bob.
- The logic for determining the MEX value is sound, as it ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the counts of elements and the constraints of the game.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
