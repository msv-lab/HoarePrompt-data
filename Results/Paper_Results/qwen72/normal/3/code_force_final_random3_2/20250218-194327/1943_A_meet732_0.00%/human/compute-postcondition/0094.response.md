Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, the value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1, and either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
