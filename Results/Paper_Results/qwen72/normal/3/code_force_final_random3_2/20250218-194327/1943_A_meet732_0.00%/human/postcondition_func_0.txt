The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`. If the integer `0` does not appear in the array, the function prints `0`. Otherwise, it finds the smallest index `j` in the range 1 to `n` where the integer `j` appears fewer than 2 times in the array, or prints `n` if no such index exists. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
