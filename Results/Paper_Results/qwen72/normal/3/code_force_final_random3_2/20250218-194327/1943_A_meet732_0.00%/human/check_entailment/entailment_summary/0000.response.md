Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. The key points to consider are:

1. **Optimal Strategy**: 
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - Alice and Bob will both try to influence the MEX by their choices.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program first counts the occurrences of each integer in the array `a` using a list `cntl`.
   - If `0` does not appear in `a`, the MEX of `c` will be `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
   - If `0` appears in `a`, the program initializes a variable `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`, which is the number of times `0` can appear in `c` without affecting the MEX.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from `1` to `n` and checks if the integer `j` appears fewer than 2 times in `a`. If it does, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` becomes `0` or if `j` is the last integer in the range. If either condition is met, it prints `j` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice will always try to add the smallest possible integer to `c` that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to remove the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - The logic of the program ensures that the MEX is correctly determined by considering the counts of each integer and the optimal moves of both players.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `0` is not in the array.
   - It also correctly handles the case where all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present in the array, ensuring the MEX is `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

Correctness: **True**
