Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
