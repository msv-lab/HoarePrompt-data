Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `cntl` will contain a count of how many times each integer in the list `a` appears. Specifically, the element at index `i` in `cntl` will be the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
