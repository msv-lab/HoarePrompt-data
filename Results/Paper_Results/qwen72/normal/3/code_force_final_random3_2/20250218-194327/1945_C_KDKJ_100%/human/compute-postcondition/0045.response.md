Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 1`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i)` is less than `abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is set to 1. If `abs(n / 2 - i)` is not less than `abs(n / 2 - ans)`, `ans` remains -1.***
