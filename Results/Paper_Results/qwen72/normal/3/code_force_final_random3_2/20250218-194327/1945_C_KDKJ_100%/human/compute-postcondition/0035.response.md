Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n`, and `left * 2` is greater than or equal to `lsum` and `right * 2` is greater than or equal to `rsum`. If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains -1.***
