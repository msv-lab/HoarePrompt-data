Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `func_1()` has been called.**

The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0. The code snippet `func_1()` calls the function `func_1`, but since the function's implementation is not provided, we cannot determine any specific changes to the variables or the return value. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the variables, with the addition that `func_1()` has been called.
