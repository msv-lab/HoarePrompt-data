### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` from the standard input. This is correct as per the problem statement.
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: It builds a prefix sum array `S` where `S[i][0]` is the number of '0's in the first `i` characters of `a`, and `S[i][1]` is the number of '1's in the first `i` characters of `a`. This is a valid approach to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's up to each position.
   - **Condition Checking**: For each possible position `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ n), it checks if the number of '0's on the left side (`left`) is at least half of the left side length (`lsum`), and if the number of '1's on the right side (`right`) is at least half of the right side length (`rsum`). This is the correct condition to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - **Optimal Position Selection**: It selects the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` while satisfying the conditions. This ensures that the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible.
   - **Output**: The function prints the optimal position `i`. If no such position exists, it prints -1, but the problem guarantees that an answer always exists, so this case should not occur.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - **Test Case Processing**: It calls `func_1` `t` times, which is correct as per the problem statement that each test case should be processed independently.
   - **Output**: The function does not return any value, but it ensures that `func_1` is called the correct number of times, and each call to `func_1` will print the result for that test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets all the requirements of the problem statement. It processes each test case independently, calculates the prefix sums correctly, checks the conditions for each possible road position, and selects the optimal position that minimizes the distance to the middle of the village while ensuring that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.

### Correctness:
**True**
