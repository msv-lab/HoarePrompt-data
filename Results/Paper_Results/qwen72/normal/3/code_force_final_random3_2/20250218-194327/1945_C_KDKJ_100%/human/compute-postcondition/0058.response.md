Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two inputs from the standard input: an integer `n` and a string `a`. It then processes the string `a` to find an index `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ n) such that the number of '0's in the first `i` characters of `a` is at least half of `i`, and the number of non-'0's in the remaining characters of `a` is at least half of `n - i`. The function prints the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`, while satisfying the above conditions. If no such index exists, it prints -1. **
