Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is equal to the number of iterations minus 1, and `func_1()` has been called the number of times equal to the number of iterations.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value provided by `int(input())` must have been at least as large as the number of iterations the loop performed. The loop variable `_` will be equal to the total number of iterations minus 1 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time). Additionally, the function `func_1()` will have been called the same number of times as the number of iterations.
