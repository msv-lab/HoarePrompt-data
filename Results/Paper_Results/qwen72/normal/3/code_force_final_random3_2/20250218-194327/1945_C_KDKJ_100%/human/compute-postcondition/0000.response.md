The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since the function `func_2` does not take any parameters and none of the variables in the function signature are used, the state of the loop depends solely on the user input.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
