### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then calls `func_1` \( t \) times.
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of houses \( n \) and the string \( a \) representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The list \( S \) is initialized with a single element \([0, 0]\) to handle the prefix sums.
   - The program iterates through the string \( a \) and updates the prefix sums for zeros and ones. The list \( S \) will have \( n+1 \) elements, where \( S[i] \) contains the number of zeros and ones up to the \( i \)-th house.
   - This is correctly implemented and allows for efficient calculation of the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road for any position \( i \).

3. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The variable \( ans \) is initialized to -1, which will store the optimal position of the road.
   - The program iterates through all possible positions \( i \) from 0 to \( n \) to check if the road can be laid after the \( i \)-th house.
   - For each position \( i \):
     - It calculates the number of zeros on the left side of the road using \( S[i][0] \).
     - It calculates the number of ones on the right side of the road using \( S[-1][1] - S[i][1] \).
     - It checks if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the left side and the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the right side.
     - If the condition is satisfied and the current position \( i \) is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position, it updates \( ans \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the optimal position \( ans \) for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum list \( S \) is correctly calculated. Each element \( S[i] \) contains the number of zeros and ones up to the \( i \)-th house.
  - This allows for efficient calculation of the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road for any position \( i \).

- **Condition Checking:**
  - The condition \( \text{left} * 2 \geq \text{lsum} \) ensures that at least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied.
  - The condition \( \text{right} * 2 \geq \text{rsum} \) ensures that at least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied.
  - These conditions are correctly implemented and checked for each position \( i \).

- **Optimal Position Selection:**
  - The program correctly updates \( ans \) to the position \( i \) that is closest to the middle of the village while satisfying the conditions.
  - The use of \( \text{abs}(n / 2 - i) \) to find the closest position is appropriate.
  - The program ensures that the optimal position is the smallest one if there are multiple positions with the same minimum distance to the middle.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem by efficiently calculating prefix sums, checking the conditions for each possible position, and selecting the optimal position. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.
