Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all potential cases. Specifically, it only checks if there is a pile with 1 stone and prints "Bob" if so, and "Alice" otherwise. This logic is flawed because the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones, not just the presence of a pile with 1 stone.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
The program will output "Alice" because there is no pile with 1 stone. However, the correct output should be "Bob" because all piles have an even number of stones, and Bob can always win by mirroring Alice's moves. Alice will always be the one to make the last move, leaving Bob with no stones to remove, thus Bob wins.

The correct logic should involve checking the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of such piles is odd, Alice wins; if it is even, Bob wins. The provided program does not handle this correctly.
