Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `l`, and `m` is the length of the list `l`. If `1` is in the list `l`, the set `e` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `1` is not in the set `e`.***
