The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's at each position in the string `a` and stores these counts in a list `S`. The function then finds the index `i` (0-based) such that the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to `i` and from `i+1` to the end of the string satisfy certain balance conditions, and this index is closest to `n / 2`. If no such index is found, the function prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the index `i` that satisfies the conditions.
