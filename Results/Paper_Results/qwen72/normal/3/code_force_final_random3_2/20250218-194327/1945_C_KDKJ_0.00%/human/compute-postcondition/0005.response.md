Output State: **`int(input())` must return a value greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called.** 

Since the code snippet only calls `func_1()`, and there are no changes to any variables or conditions specified in the initial state, the output state remains the same as the initial state. The function `func_1()` has been executed, but without knowing what `func_1()` does, we cannot determine any changes to the program state. Therefore, the only update is that `func_1()` has been called.
