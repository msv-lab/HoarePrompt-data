The code snippet `left = S[i][0]` assigns the value of `S[0][0]` to the variable `left`. Since `i` is 0, this means `left` is assigned the first element of the first list in `S`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is the first element of the first list in `S`.**
