Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
