Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left` is the first element of the list `S[i]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`, `ans` is 1.**

The value of `ans` is updated to 1, while the other variables (`n`, `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions that `n` must be greater than 1 and `ans` is 0 if the conditions are met are no longer applicable because `ans` has been explicitly set to 1.
