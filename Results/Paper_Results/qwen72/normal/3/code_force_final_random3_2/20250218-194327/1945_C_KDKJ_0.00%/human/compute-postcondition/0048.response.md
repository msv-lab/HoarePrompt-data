Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is set to 1. If `abs(n / 2 - i) > abs(n / 2 - ans)`, `ans` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `left = S[i][0]` updates the value of `left` to be the first element of the list `S[i]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and logic for continuing to the next iteration of the loop or setting `ans` to 1 or 0 are still valid as they were in the initial state.
