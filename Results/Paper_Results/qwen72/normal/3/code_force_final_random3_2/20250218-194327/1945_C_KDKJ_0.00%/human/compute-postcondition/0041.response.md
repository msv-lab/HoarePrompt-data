Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left` is the first element of the list `S[i]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - lsum`, `ans` is 0 if the conditions are met.**

The value of `right` is updated to be the difference between the second element of the last list in `S` and the second element of the first list in `S` (which is `S[i][1]` since `i` is 1). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
