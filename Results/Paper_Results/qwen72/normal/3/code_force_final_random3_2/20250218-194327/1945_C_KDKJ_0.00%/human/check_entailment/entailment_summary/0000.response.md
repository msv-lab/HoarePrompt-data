### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
   - **Cumulative Counts**: It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's at each position in the string `a` and stores these counts in a list `S`. The list `S` is initialized with a starting point `[0, 0]` and then updated as the function iterates through the string `a`.
   - **Balance Conditions**: The function then iterates through the positions `i` from 0 to `n-1` and checks if the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to `i` and from `i+1` to the end of the string satisfy the balance conditions:
     - For the left side: `left * 2 >= lsum` (where `left` is the count of '0's and `lsum` is the total count of houses on the left side).
     - For the right side: `right * 2 >= rsum` (where `right` is the count of '1's and `rsum` is the total count of houses on the right side).
   - **Optimal Position**: If the balance conditions are satisfied, the function checks if the current position `i` is closer to `n / 2` than the previously found position `ans`. If it is, `ans` is updated to `i`.
   - **Output**: The function prints the position `ans` that satisfies the balance conditions and is closest to `n / 2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**: It then calls `func_1` `t` times, each time processing a new test case as described in the problem statement.
   - **Output**: The function does not return any value but prints the output for each test case as `func_1` is called.

### Analysis:
- **Cumulative Counts**: The cumulative counts of '0's and '1's are correctly calculated and stored in `S`.
- **Balance Conditions**: The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` are used to check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. This is correct because it ensures that the number of satisfied residents on each side is at least the ceiling of half the total number of residents on that side.
- **Optimal Position**: The function correctly updates `ans` to the position `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies the balance conditions.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem by ensuring that the road is laid in a position that satisfies the balance conditions and is as close to the middle of the village as possible. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to handle multiple test cases and produce the correct output for each test case.
