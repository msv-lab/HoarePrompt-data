Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left` is the first element of the list `S[i]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`, `ans` is 0 if the conditions are met.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rsum` is updated to `n - lsum`.
- Since `lsum` is defined as `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, the new value of `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `ans` is 0 if the conditions are met is still valid.
