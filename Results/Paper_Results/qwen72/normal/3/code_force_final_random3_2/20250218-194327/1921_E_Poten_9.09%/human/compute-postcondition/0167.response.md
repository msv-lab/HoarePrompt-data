Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `test_cases - 1`, where `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `answers` is a list containing at least two elements, which can be either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
   - `j` is the second element in the `answers` list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `j`:**
   - According to the initial state, `j` is the second element in the `answers` list.
   - The `answers` list contains at least two elements, and each element can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
   - Therefore, `j` will be one of these three values: 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(j)` statement will print the second element of the `answers` list.
   - Since the exact elements of the `answers` list are not provided, we can only describe the possible values of `j`.

Output: **j (where j is the second element in the `answers` list, which can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice')**
