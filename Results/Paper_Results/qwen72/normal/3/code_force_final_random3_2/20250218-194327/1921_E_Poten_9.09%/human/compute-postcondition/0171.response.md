The function `func` is designed to be called without any arguments. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, where `1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9`. It is guaranteed that either `x_a ≠ x_b` or `y_a ≠ y_b`. The function should also handle an initial input `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.

Functionality: **The function `func` accepts no arguments but processes `t` test cases, each with six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It returns a list of results, where each result is based on the input test case.**
