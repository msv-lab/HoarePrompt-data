Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Bob', `func` is expected to be called with no arguments but should handle multiple test cases, `clues` is a list of integers input by the user. The third element of `clues` is not greater than the fifth element, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1, and the third and fifth elements of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element, the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element, and the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is 1 or less. If either `clues[3] - 1` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Bob'.***
