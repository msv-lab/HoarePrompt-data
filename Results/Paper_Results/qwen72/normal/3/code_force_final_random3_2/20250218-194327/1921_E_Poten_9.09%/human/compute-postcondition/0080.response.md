Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `func` is expected to be called with no arguments but should handle multiple test cases, `clues` is a list of integers input by the user. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, `answers` contains 'Bob' if `clues[3] == clues[5]`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if either `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, and either `clues[3] - 1` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw' if either the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, and either the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` is less than twice the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than twice the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, if `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and none of the above conditions are met, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are of different parity (one is even and the other is odd), `answers` contains 'Alice' if `clues[3] == clues[5]`. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and the condition `(clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true, or if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1 and the condition `(clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
