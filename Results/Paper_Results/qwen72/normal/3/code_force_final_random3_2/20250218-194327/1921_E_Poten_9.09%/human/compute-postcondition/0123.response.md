Output State: **`i` is 2, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` updates the `clues` variable to a list of integers that are provided by the user as input, where each integer is separated by a space. The values of `i` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
