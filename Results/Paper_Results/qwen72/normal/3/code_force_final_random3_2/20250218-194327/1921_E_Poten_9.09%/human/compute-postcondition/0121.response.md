Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, an additional 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even or both are odd, 'Bob' is appended to `answers` if `clues[3] == clues[5]` or if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and certain conditions are met. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, 'Draw' or 'Bob' is appended to `answers` based on other specific conditions. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` do not both have the same parity, 'Alice' is appended to `answers` if `clues[3] == clues[5]` or if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and certain conditions are met. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, 'Draw' or 'Alice' is appended to `answers` based on other specific conditions.***
