Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Alice', `func` is expected to be called with no arguments but should handle multiple test cases, `clues` is a list of integers input by the user. The third element of `clues` is not greater than the fifth element, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even, or `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element, the fourth element of `clues` is less than the fifth element, and the absolute difference between the fourth and fifth elements of `clues` is greater than 1. If the condition `(clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true, `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Alice'.***
