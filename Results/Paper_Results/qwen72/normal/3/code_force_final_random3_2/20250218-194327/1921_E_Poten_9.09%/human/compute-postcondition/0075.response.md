Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Alice', `func` is expected to be called with no arguments but should handle multiple test cases, `clues` is a list of integers input by the user. The third element of `clues` is not greater than the fifth element, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even, or `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element, `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and the condition `(clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true, `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1 and the condition `(clues[5] - 1 - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true, `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
