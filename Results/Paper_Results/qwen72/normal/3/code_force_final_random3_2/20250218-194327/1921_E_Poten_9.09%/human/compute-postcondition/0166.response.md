The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the list `answers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `answers`. If `answers` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `test_cases` - 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing at least one element, and `j` is the first element in `answers`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must have at least two elements, and `j` will be the second element in `answers`.

State: **`i` is `test_cases` - 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing at least two elements (either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), `j` is the second element in `answers`**
