The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `answers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `answers`. If the list `answers` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` and the value of `test_cases` are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `answers` must contain at least one element, and `j` should be the first element of `answers` at the start of the loop.

State: **`i` is `test_cases` - 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing at least one element (either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), `j` is the first element in `answers`**
