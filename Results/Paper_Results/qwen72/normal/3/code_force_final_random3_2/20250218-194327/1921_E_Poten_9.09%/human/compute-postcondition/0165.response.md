Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `test_cases - 1`, where `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `answers` is a list containing at least one element, which can be either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
   - `j` is the first element in the `answers` list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - Since `answers` is a list containing at least one element, and `j` is defined as the first element in `answers`, `j` will be one of the values 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
   - The `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`, which is the first element in the `answers` list.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output will be the first element of the `answers` list, which can be either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.

Output: **[j] (where j is the first element in the answers list, which can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice')**
