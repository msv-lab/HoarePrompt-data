Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `test_cases - 1`, where `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `answers` is a list containing at least three elements, each of which can be either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
   - `j` is the third element in the `answers` list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly defined as the third element in the `answers` list.
   - Since `answers` is a list containing at least three elements, and each element can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', the value of `j` will be one of these three strings.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(j)` statement will print the third element of the `answers` list.
   - The exact value of `j` depends on the content of the `answers` list, but it will be one of the strings 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **j (where j is the third element in the `answers` list, and can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice')**
