The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers input by the user.**
