You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It determines the winner of a game or if it results in a draw based on the positions of two players (Alice and Bob) on a grid of dimensions `h` x `w`. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, processes each test case, and prints the result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the printed results for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`.
   - These integers represent the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Draw Conditions:**
   - The program checks if Alice's chip is already in the last row (`x_a > x_b`) or if the board has only one row (`h == 1`). In these cases, the game ends in a draw because no player can make a move that would result in a win.
   - This is correctly handled by the condition `if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1`.

3. **Row Parity Conditions:**
   - The program checks if both `x_a` and `x_b` are either even or odd. This is based on the observation that if both players are in the same parity row, the game can end in a draw or a win for Bob.
   - The condition `if clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0)` correctly identifies this scenario.

4. **Column Alignment Conditions:**
   - If the chips are in the same column (`y_a == y_b`), the program checks if the game can end in a draw or a win for Bob.
   - The condition `if clues[3] == clues[5]` correctly identifies this scenario and appends "Bob" to the answers list.

5. **Column Misalignment Conditions:**
   - If the chips are not in the same column, the program checks the distance between the columns and the number of rows between the chips.
   - The program uses the condition `if abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1` to determine if the chips are more than one column apart.
   - It then checks if the distance between the columns is greater than half the distance between the rows (`abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`). If so, the game ends in a draw.
   - If the distance between the columns is less than or equal to one, the program checks if the game can end in a draw or a win for Alice.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case after processing all the test cases.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The program correctly handles the draw conditions when Alice's chip is in the last row or the board has only one row.
- The row parity conditions are correctly checked, and the program correctly identifies scenarios where the game can end in a draw or a win for Bob.
- The column alignment and misalignment conditions are also correctly checked, ensuring that the program can determine the outcome based on the relative positions of the chips.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for determining the outcome when the chips are not in the same column and the row parity is the same is complex and may have edge cases that are not fully covered.
- Specifically, the conditions for determining a draw or a win for Bob when the chips are more than one column apart and the row parity is the same could be simplified or better explained.

### Conclusion:
Despite the complexity, the program appears to handle all the given conditions correctly. However, the logic for determining the outcome when the chips are not in the same column and the row parity is the same could be simplified for better readability and to ensure correctness in all edge cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the test cases. It correctly handles all the scenarios and outputs the correct results.
