The code snippet `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. The initial state does not provide information about the list `answers`, so we can assume it is an existing list. The values of `i` and `test_cases` are not affected by this code snippet. The list `clues` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `answers` now includes 'Alice' as the last element.**
