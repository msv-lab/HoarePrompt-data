The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `answers`. The loop iterates over the elements of `answers`, and `j` is set to the current element in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `test_cases` - 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing at least two elements, and `j` is the second element in `answers`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `answers` must be considered. Since `j` is currently the second element, the next iteration will set `j` to the third element in `answers`. Therefore, `j` must be the third element in `answers`.

State: **`i` is `test_cases` - 1, `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing at least three elements (either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), `j` is the third element in `answers`**
