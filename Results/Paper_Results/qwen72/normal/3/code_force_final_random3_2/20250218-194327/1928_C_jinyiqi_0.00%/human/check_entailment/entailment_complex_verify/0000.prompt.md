You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that combines `output2` and `output1`. `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order. `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, in decreasing order. The resulting list is a combination of these two lists, with `output2` followed by `output1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, sorted in decreasing order. The list includes both divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` and those that are greater than the square root of `x`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in the way it handles the constraints and the calculation of possible values for `k`. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`, but the logic for determining valid `k` values is flawed.

### Issue:
1. **Divisor Calculation and Validation**:
   - The program calculates the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` and then checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` value. However, the condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is not sufficient to ensure that the `k` value is valid according to the problem description.
   - The problem description states that the settling repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the valid `k` values should be such that Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received are consistent with the described pattern.

### Example Case:
Consider the input `n = 10` and `x = 2`:
- The program should output `4` because `k = 2, 3, 5, 6` are valid.
- However, the program's logic for determining valid `k` values is not robust enough to handle all cases correctly.

### Specific Case:
For `n = 10` and `x = 2`:
- The program calculates the divisors of `10 + 2 - 2 = 10` and `10 - 2 = 8`.
- The divisors of `10` are `[1, 2, 5, 10]`, and the divisors of `8` are `[1, 2, 4, 8]`.
- The program then checks if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` value, but it does not correctly filter out invalid `k` values.

### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Calculate the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
2. For each divisor `s`, check if `(s + 2) / 2` is a valid `k` value by ensuring that the position `n` and the number `x` are consistent with the described pattern.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases and may produce incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
