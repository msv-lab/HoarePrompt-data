Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing `[1]`, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `x % i == 0`.**

The value of `x` remains unchanged. The list `output1` now contains the integer `1` because `i` was appended to it. The list `output2` remains empty. The value of `i` is still `1`, and `x` is still divisible by `i` without any remainder.
