The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0 or 1, so the new value of `i` is 1 or 2. The conditions for `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` remains 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is incremented to 2, with `b[j]` being greater than or equal to `a[i-1]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1 or 2, `j` is 2, and `cnt` is 0 or 1. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 2, with `b[j]` being greater than or equal to `a[i-1]`.**
