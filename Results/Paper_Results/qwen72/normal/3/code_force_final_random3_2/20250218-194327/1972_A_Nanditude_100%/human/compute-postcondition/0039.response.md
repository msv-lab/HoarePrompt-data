The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range `n`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `j` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2.**
