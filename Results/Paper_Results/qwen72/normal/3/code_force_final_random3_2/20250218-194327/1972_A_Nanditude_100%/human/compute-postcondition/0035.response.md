The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `j` (which will be 1).

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1.**
