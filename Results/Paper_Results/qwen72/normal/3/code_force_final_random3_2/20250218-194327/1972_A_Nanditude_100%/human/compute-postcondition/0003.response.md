Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with each element between 1 and 10^9. After executing the code, `a` is updated to the new list of integers provided by the input.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- The new list `a` will still be a list of integers, but its specific values depend on the input provided. The precondition that `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and each element is between 1 and 10^9 is still valid, assuming the input adheres to these constraints.
