Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is 0.**

The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
