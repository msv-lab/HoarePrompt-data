You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Example

Input

    2
    
    6
    
    1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
    
    800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
    
    6
    
    4 5 6 7 8 9
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6

Output

    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, b is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required), `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is the last list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `i` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b` up to the last element of `b`, `j` is `n-1`, and `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` up to the last element of `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each, both sorted in non-decreasing order (1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9 and 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9). The function then calculates and prints the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and the last processed values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remaining as they were at the end of the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that when a new problem is proposed, the most difficult problem is removed, and the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

The program will output:
```
2
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
3
```

### Explanation of the Counterexample:
1. Initially, `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]` and `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`.
2. The first problem in `a` (1000) is already less than or equal to the first problem in `b` (800), so no new problem is needed here.
3. The second problem in `a` (1400) is greater than the second problem in `b` (1200), so a new problem with difficulty 1200 is proposed. After insertion and sorting, `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 2000, 2000]` and the last element (2700) is removed. Now `a = [800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 2000, 2000]`.
4. The third problem in `a` (2000) is greater than the third problem in `b` (1500), so a new problem with difficulty 1500 is proposed. After insertion and sorting, `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 2000]` and the last element (2000) is removed. Now `a = [800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 2000]`.
5. The fourth problem in `a` (2000) is greater than the fourth problem in `b` (1800), so a new problem with difficulty 1800 is proposed. After insertion and sorting, `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 1800]` and the last element (2000) is removed. Now `a = [800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 1800]`.

Thus, the minimum number of new problems needed is 3, not 2 as the program outputs.

The program incorrectly counts the number of new problems needed by not properly simulating the insertion, sorting, and removal process. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
