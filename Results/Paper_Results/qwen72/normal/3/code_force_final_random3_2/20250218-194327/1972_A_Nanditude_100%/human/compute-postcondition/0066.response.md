To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `b` is a new list of integers input by the user.
   - `i` is the number of elements in `b` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `a` up to the point where `b[j]` is no longer less than `a[i]`.
   - `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` up to the point where `b[j]` is no longer less than `a[i]`.
   - `j` is `n-1` after the loop completes all iterations.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is the length of the lists `a` and `b`.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers of the same length.
   - `i` and `cnt` are counters that are updated based on the comparison of elements in `a` and `b`.

3. **Logic of the Problem:**
   - The loop iterates through the lists `a` and `b` from the end to the beginning.
   - For each pair of elements `a[i]` and `b[j]`, it checks if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.
   - If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is incremented.
   - The loop stops when `b[j]` is no longer less than `a[i]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will output the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` up to the point where `b[j]` is no longer less than `a[i]`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the value of `cnt`, which is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` up to the point where `b[j]` is no longer less than `a[i]`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` up to the point where `b[j]` is no longer less than `a[i]`)**
