Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required), `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`.**
