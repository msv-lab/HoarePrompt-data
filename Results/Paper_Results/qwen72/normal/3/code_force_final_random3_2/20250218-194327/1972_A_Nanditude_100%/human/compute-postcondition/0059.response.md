Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `j` is 1, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial comparison of `b[j]` and `a[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 1 if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, or `i` remains 0 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.
- The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1.
- If `i` was initially 0, it is now 1.
- If `i` was initially 1, it is now 2.
- The value of `cnt` remains unchanged and is still either 0 or 1 based on the initial comparison.
- The states of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain the same as they were not affected by the code snippet.
