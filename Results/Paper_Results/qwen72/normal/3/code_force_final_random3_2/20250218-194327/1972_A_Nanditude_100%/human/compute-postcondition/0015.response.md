The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is 0 or 1, so after this increment, `i` will be 1 or 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1 or 2, `j` is 1, and `cnt` is 0 or 1. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i-1]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` was 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` was 1, with `b[j]` being greater than or equal to `a[i-1]`.**
