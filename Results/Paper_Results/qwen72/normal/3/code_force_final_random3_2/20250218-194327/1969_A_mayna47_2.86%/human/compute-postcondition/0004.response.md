The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes a function that takes two parameters: a list of integers `p` and an integer `n`.
- The list `p` has a length of `n`, and each element `p_i` in `p` is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i != i, and all `p_i` are distinct.
- The integer `n` is given as 2.
- The list `v` is initialized with a length of `n + 1` (which is 3), with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as a list of integers provided by the user.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `p` is a list of integers of length `n` (which is 2).
   - `n` is 2.
   - `v` is a list of length 3, where `v[0]` is 0, and `v[1]` and `v[2]` are integers provided by the user.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(2)`.
   - This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer 2.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the integer 2.

Output: **2**
