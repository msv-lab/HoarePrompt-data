Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. Let's break down the logic and the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of length `n + 1` with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as the input list of best friends.
   - If `n` is 2, it prints 2 and returns. This is correct because if there are only 2 friends, Monocarp needs to invite both to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the list `v` from 1 to `n` and checks if `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` for any `i`. If this condition is met, it prints 2 and returns. This condition checks if there is a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships, which means inviting any 2 friends in this cycle will ensure both come to the party.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a cycle, it prints 3. This is based on the assumption that if there is no cycle of length 3, the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `n = 2`**
     - The program correctly prints 2 because inviting both friends is necessary and sufficient.
   - **Case 2: `n > 2` and `v[v[v[i]]] == i` for some `i`**
     - The program correctly prints 2 because this condition indicates a cycle of length 3, and inviting any 2 friends in this cycle will ensure both come to the party.
   - **Case 3: `n > 2` and no `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`**
     - The program prints 3. This is incorrect because it does not consider other possible scenarios where fewer than 3 invitations might be sufficient. For example, if there are multiple pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, inviting just 2 friends from any of these pairs would be sufficient.

4. **Missing Considerations:**
   - The program does not handle cases where there are multiple pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. For example, if `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`, the program should print 2, but it will print 3 because it does not check for such pairs.

Given the above analysis, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
