You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three digits a, b, and c. The function should be called with the digits a, b, and c as arguments, and these digits must satisfy 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. Additionally, the number of test cases t must be a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the provided function definition does not include parameters for the digits or the number of test cases, which is inconsistent with the problem description.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is less than `c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c` and it is not the case that `a < b > c`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters, which is inconsistent with the problem description that requires processing multiple test cases with three digits a, b, and c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9) for each test case, and the number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 1000). The function's current definition does not match the intended functionality.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
