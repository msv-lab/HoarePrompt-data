The `print('NONE')` statement will print the string 'NONE' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. The precondition only specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, and the conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` are not true. However, these conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement, which is a fixed string.

Output: **NONE**
