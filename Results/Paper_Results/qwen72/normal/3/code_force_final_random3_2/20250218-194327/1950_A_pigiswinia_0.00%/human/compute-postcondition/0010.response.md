Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` is false, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`.***
