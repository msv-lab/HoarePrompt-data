Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`t` must be greater than 0**: This condition is not directly relevant to the print statement, but it ensures that the program is running under a valid context.
2. **`i` is 0**: This is a simple initialization of the variable `i`.
3. **`string` is an input string**: This means `string` is a string provided by the user.
4. **`s` is a list of characters from `string`**: This means `s` is a list where each element is a character from the `string`.
5. **`n` is the length of `s`**: `n` is the number of characters in the list `s`.
6. **`done` is False**: This is a simple initialization of the variable `done`.
7. **`x` is the first character of `s`**: `x` is the first character in the list `s`.
8. **`x` is not equal to the last character of `s` if `n` is greater than 1**: This means if the list `s` has more than one character, the first character `x` is not the same as the last character.
9. **`s.count(x)` is equal to `n - 1`**: This means the first character `x` appears exactly `n - 1` times in the list `s`.
10. **The length of `s` is either even or the middle character of `s` is equal to `x`**: This means either `n` is even, or if `n` is odd, the middle character of `s` is `x`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- **`s.count(x) == n - 1`**: This condition implies that the first character `x` appears `n - 1` times in the list `s`. Since `x` is the first character, it must appear in all positions except one.
- **`x` is not equal to the last character of `s` if `n` is greater than 1**: This means the only character that is not `x` is the last character of `s`.
- **The length of `s` is either even or the middle character of `s` is equal to `x`**: If `n` is even, the condition is satisfied by default. If `n` is odd, the middle character must be `x`, which is also consistent with the previous conditions.

Given these conditions, the list `s` must be of the form where the first character `x` appears in all positions except the last one. This structure satisfies all the given conditions.

Since the print statement simply prints the string `'YES'`, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
