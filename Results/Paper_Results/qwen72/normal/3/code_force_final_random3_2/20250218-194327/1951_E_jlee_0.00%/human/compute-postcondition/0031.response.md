Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, and `x` is the first character of `s`. If `x` appears exactly `n` times in `s`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s` when `n` is greater than 1, and `n` is not 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop if `s.count(x)` is equal to `n - 1`. If `n` is odd, the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`. If `n` is even or the middle character of `s` is equal to `x`, the program also continues to the next iteration. If `s.count(x)` is not equal to `n - 1`, the program state remains unchanged.***
