Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 4 characters.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 3.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t > 1` (not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `i = 1` (not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 4 characters.
   - `n = len(s)` and `n > 3`.
   - `x = s[0]` (the first character of `s`).
   - `j = 2` (the index used for checking conditions).
   - `count` is a variable that is set to 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.
   - `done` is a boolean variable that is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.
   - This statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will print the string 'YES' because the print statement itself is a simple string literal and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
