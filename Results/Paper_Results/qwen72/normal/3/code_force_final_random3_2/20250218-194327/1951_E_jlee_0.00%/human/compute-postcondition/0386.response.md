Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `string` is a new input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is now 1. Otherwise, `count` remains greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`string` and `s`**:
   - `string` is a new input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.

2. **`n`**:
   - `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 5. This means `string` has more than 5 characters.

3. **`x`**:
   - `x` is the first character of `s`, which is also the first character of `string`.

4. **`j`**:
   - `j` is 1.

5. **`done`**:
   - `done` is True if `s[j]` (the second character of `string`) is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (the second-to-last character of `string`).

6. **`count`**:
   - If `s[j]` (the second character of `string`) is not equal to `x` (the first character of `string`) and `count` was less than 1, `count` is now 1.
   - Otherwise, `count` remains greater than 0.

### Print Statement:
- The print statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])` will split the `string` into two parts:
  - `string[:j]` will be the substring from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j` (which is 1). This means it will print the first character of `string`.
  - `string[j:]` will be the substring from the character at index `j` (which is 1) to the end of `string`. This means it will print the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Final Output:
- The first part `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
- The second part `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string], [rest of the string starting from the second character]**
