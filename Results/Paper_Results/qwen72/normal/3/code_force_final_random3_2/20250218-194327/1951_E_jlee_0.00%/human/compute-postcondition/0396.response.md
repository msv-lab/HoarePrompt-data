Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `string` is a new input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
   - `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5.
   - `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the `print` statement because the statement does not use any of these variables or objects.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, or `done`.

Output: **YES**
