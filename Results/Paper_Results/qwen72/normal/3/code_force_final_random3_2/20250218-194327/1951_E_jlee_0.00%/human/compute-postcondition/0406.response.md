Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `string` is a new input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. Otherwise, `count` retains its original value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`string` and `s`**:
   - `string` is a new input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.

2. **`n`**:
   - `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 5. This means `string` has more than 5 characters.

3. **`x`**:
   - `x` is the first character of `s`, which is the same as the first character of `string`.

4. **`j`**:
   - `j` is 2.

5. **`done`**:
   - `done` is True if `s[j]` (the third character of `string`) is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (the third character from the end of `string`).

6. **`count`**:
   - If `s[j]` (the third character of `string`) is not equal to `x` (the first character of `string`) and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2.
   - Otherwise, `count` retains its original value.

### What is Printed:
- The `print(string[:j], string[j:])` statement will split the `string` into two parts:
  - `string[:j]` will print the first 2 characters of `string`.
  - `string[j:]` will print the remaining characters of `string` starting from the third character.

### Final Output:
- Since `j` is 2, the first 2 characters of `string` will be printed followed by the rest of the string starting from the third character.

Output: **[first 2 characters of string] [remaining characters of string starting from the third character]**
