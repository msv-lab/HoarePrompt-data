To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character.
   - `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
   - `count2` is equal to `count`.
   - `count` is greater than 1.
   - `done` remains False unless the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`.
   - Additionally, the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`.

2. **Understanding the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement is: `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.
   - This statement will split the `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j - 1]` is a substring from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`.
     - `string[j - 1:]` is a substring from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

3. **Determining the value of `j`:**
   - The value of `j` is not explicitly given, but it is mentioned that the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x` and not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`.
   - Since `s` is a list of characters from `string`, and `j` is an index in `s`, `j` must be an integer between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive).
   - The condition `done` being False unless the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s` suggests that `j` is a specific index where the characters are not equal.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will split `string` at the position `j - 1`.
   - Since `j` is an index in `s`, and `s` is derived from `string`, the exact value of `j` in `string` is not directly given but can be inferred from the conditions.
   - The output will be two substrings of `string`:
     - The first substring is from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j - 1`.
     - The second substring is from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of `string`.

Given the conditions, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **[string[:j - 1]], [string[j - 1:]] (where `j` is the index in `s` such that the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x` and not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`)**
