Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `string` is a new input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is now 1. Otherwise, `count` remains greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `j`**: According to the initial state, `j` is 1.
2. **Value of `string[:j - 1]`**: Since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0. Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` is `string[:0]`, which is an empty string `''`.
3. **Value of `string[j - 1:]`**: Since `j - 1` is 0, `string[j - 1:]` is `string[0:]`, which is the entire `string`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print an empty string followed by the entire `string`.

Output: **'' [string] (where [string] is the new input string)**
