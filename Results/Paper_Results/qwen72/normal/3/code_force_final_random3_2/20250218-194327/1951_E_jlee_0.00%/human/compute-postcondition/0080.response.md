The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes various variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output of the code snippet is solely determined by the string literal `'YES'` inside the `print` function.

Output: **YES**
