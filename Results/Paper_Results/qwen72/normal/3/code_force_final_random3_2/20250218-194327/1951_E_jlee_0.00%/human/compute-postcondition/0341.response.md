Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `string` is a new input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
   - `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5.
   - `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count2` is equal to `count`.
   - `count` is greater than 1.
   - `done` remains False.
   - Additionally, the first element of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to `x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `string[:j - 1]` is equivalent to `string[:0 - 1]`, which is `string[-1]`. This will give the last character of the string `string`.
   - `string[j - 1:]` is equivalent to `string[-1:]`, which will give the last character of the string `string` and all characters following it (which is just the last character itself).

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the last character of `string` followed by the last character of `string` again.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **[last character of string] [last character of string]** (where the last character of string is the last character of the input string `string`).

This means the print statement will output the last character of the string `string` twice, separated by a space.
