Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 4 characters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 3, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.***
