Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of the new `s`.
- `done` is False.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `count` is a non-negative integer.
- `count2` is a non-negative integer.
- If `n` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
