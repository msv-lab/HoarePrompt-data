Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 2, and `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, `count` retains its original value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` == `count`, `count` retains its original value if `count` > 1, otherwise, `count` is set to 2 and `count2` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` > `count`, `count` retains its original value if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, otherwise, `count` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, `count` retains its original value and `count2` is 0. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count` retains its original value and `count2` is increased by 1.***
