You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the string `s` has a length of 1, it is a palindrome by definition. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

3. **Checking if the First and Last Characters are Different:**
   - If the first and last characters of the string `s` are different, the entire string is not a palindrome. The program correctly prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.

4. **Checking if All Characters are the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string `s` are the same, the string is a palindrome and any substring of it will also be a palindrome. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

5. **Checking if All but One Character are the Same:**
   - If all but one character in the string `s` are the same, the program checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If the string length is odd and the middle character is different, the program correctly prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition. This is correct because the string itself is not a palindrome if the middle character is the same as the others.

6. **General Case:**
   - For strings where the first and last characters are the same, the program attempts to find a partition where at least one substring is not a palindrome.
   - It iterates through the string to find the first pair of characters that are different.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
   - If no such pair is found, it attempts to find a valid partition by splitting the string into two parts where the first part ends at the first different character and the second part starts at the next character.
   - The logic for finding the partition is complex but aims to ensure that the resulting substrings are not palindromes.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as strings of length 1 and strings where all characters are the same.
   - It also handles cases where the string is a palindrome with one different character in the middle.

8. **Output Format:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" or "NO" followed by the number of parts and the partition itself when applicable.

### Correctness:
The program is mostly correct, but there are a few issues in the logic for finding the partition in the general case. Specifically, the logic for splitting the string into two parts is overly complex and may not always produce the correct partition. However, the overall structure and handling of edge cases are correct.

### Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly handle some cases where the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, the string "abba" should be partitioned into "a" and "bba" or "ab" and "ba", but the program may not produce the correct partition in such cases. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.
