Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, and `done` is False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, and `done` remains False. If `s[j]` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is equal to or greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is less than or equal to 0, `done` remains False. If `count` is 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `s[j]` (i.e., `s[0]`) is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 1, and `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1 and `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` is greater than `count`, or if `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is now 1. Otherwise, `count` remains greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 2, and `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count` > 0: If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, `count` retains its original value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` == `count`, `count` retains its original value if `count` > 1, otherwise, `count` is set to 2 and `count2` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` > `count`, `count` retains its original value if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, otherwise, `count` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, `count` retains its original value and `count2` is 0. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count` retains its original value and `count2` is increased by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, `count` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
