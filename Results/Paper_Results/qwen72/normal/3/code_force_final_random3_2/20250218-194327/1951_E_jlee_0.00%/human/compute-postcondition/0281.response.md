Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 6 characters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 5, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 3, and `count2` retains its original value. If `count2` == `count`, `count2` is 0 if `count` is not greater than 1. `done` retains its original value if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is set to True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is updated to 3. If `count` is greater than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count2` > `count`, `done` is set to True, and `count` retains its original value if it is less than 1 or if `s[j]` is equal to `x`. If `count2` is not greater than `count`, `done` and `count` retain their original values.***
