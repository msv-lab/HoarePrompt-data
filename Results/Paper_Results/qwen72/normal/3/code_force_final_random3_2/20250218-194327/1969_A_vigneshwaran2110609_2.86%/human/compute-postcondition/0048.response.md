Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is True, and the element at the index `l[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to `l[i] - 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
