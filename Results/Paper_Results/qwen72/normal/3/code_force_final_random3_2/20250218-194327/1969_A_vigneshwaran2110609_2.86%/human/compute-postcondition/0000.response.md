Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct. n is an input integer.**

The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, which must satisfy the condition 2 <= n <= 50. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
