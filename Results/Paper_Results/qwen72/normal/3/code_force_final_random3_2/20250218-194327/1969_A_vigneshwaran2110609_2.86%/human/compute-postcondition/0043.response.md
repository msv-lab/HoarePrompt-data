Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is `x`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `l`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The variable `flag` is not affected by this code snippet.
- The new value of `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
