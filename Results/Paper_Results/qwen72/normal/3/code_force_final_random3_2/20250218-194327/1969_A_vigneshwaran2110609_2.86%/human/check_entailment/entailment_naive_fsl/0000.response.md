Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations needed is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
3
2
```

Actual Output:
```
2
2
2
```

The program always prints 2 if it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and it prints 3 otherwise. However, this logic is incorrect for the second test case, where the correct answer is 3, but the program prints 2. The program does not consider the structure of the relationships and fails to find the correct minimum number of invitations needed.
