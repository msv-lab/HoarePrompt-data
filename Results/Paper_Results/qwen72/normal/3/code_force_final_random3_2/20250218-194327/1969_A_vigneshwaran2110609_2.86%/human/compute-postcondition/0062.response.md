The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is expected to accept two parameters: `t` and `n`, and a list `p`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the size of the list `p`.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but it is expected to process these inputs and return a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` is between 1 and `n` and `p_i` ≠ i. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**
