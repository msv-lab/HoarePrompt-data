Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
   - `mini` is the first element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the second element of `arr`.
   - `arr` must have at least three elements.
   - `item` is the third element of `arr`.
   - `res` is an input string with the current value being '>' if the condition is met.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `res` is given as '>', so `mini` will be the second element of `arr`.
   - `item` is the third element of `arr`.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with '?', followed by the value of `mini` twice, and then the value of `item` twice.
   - Since `mini` is the second element of `arr` and `item` is the third element of `arr`, the output will be:
     - '?', `arr[1]`, `arr[1]`, `arr[2]`, `arr[2]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact values of `arr[1]` and `arr[2]` are not provided, but they are known to be the second and third elements of the list `arr` respectively.

Output: **? [arr[1]] [arr[1]] [arr[2]] [arr[2]] (where [arr[1]] is the second element of the list `arr` and [arr[2]] is the third element of the list `arr`)**
