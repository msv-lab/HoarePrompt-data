The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 3).

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. If `res` is '<', `arr` is `[2]` and `item` is `2`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', `arr` is `[0]` or `[1]` or `[0, 1]` and `item` is `0` or `1`. If `res` is '=', `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]` or `[0, 2]` or `[1, 2]` and `item` is `0` or `1`.**
