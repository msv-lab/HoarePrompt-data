You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a sequence of test cases, each with a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the function can make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the element in the permutation that, when XORed with itself, results in the maximum value among all such XOR operations, `arr` contains the indices of all elements that, when XORed with `maxi`, resulted in a value that is either equal to or less than the current maximum, and `mini` is the index of the element in `arr` that, when XORed with `maxi`, results in the minimum value among all such XOR operations. `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates in an interactive environment to find and return a pair of indices (i, j) for each test case such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices, p_i ⊕ p_j, is maximized. It can handle up to 10^3 test cases, with each permutation length n ranging from 2 to 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^4.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
