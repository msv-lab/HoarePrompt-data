The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2. The loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [1]. If `res` is '=', then `arr` also contains [1]. If `res` is not '<' or '=', then `arr` remains unchanged.**
