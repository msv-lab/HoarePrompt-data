Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **`n` is an integer at least 1**: This means `n` is a positive integer.
2. **`i` is `n-1`**: `i` is one less than `n`.
3. **`maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists**: `maxi` is the largest index where `res` was '<', or 0 if `res` was never '<'.
4. **`arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least 4 elements**: `arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, each of which corresponds to a condition where `res` was either '<' or '='.
5. **`mini` remains the second element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the third element of `arr`**: `mini` is the second element of `arr` unless `res` is '>', in which case `mini` is the third element of `arr`.
6. **`item` is the fourth element of `arr`**: `item` is the fourth element of `arr`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:
```
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

- The first element printed is a string `'?'`.
- The next two elements are `mini`, which is either the second or third element of `arr` depending on the value of `res`.
- The last two elements are `item`, which is the fourth element of `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `mini` is the second element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise it is the third element of `arr`.
- `item` is the fourth element of `arr`.

Since `arr` must have at least 4 elements, we can denote the elements of `arr` as `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, `arr[2]`, and `arr[3]`.

If `res` is not '>', then:
- `mini` is `arr[1]`.
- `item` is `arr[3]`.

If `res` is '>', then:
- `mini` is `arr[2]`.
- `item` is `arr[3]`.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If `res` is not '>', the output will be: `? arr[1] arr[1] arr[3] arr[3]`.
- If `res` is '>', the output will be: `? arr[2] arr[2] arr[3] arr[3]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `res`, we need to cover both cases in our output.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the second element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise the third element of `arr`, and [item] is the fourth element of `arr`)**
