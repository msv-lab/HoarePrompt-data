Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
   - `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'.
   - `arr` is `[0]`.
   - `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `maxi` is described as the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'. However, since `arr` is `[0]` and there is only one element in the list, `maxi` must be 0 because it is the only index available.
   - `arr[0]` is the first (and only) element of the list `arr`, which is 0.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi`, and `i`.
   - Substituting the values, the output will be: `'?'`, 0, 0, 0, 1.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **? 0 0 0 1**
