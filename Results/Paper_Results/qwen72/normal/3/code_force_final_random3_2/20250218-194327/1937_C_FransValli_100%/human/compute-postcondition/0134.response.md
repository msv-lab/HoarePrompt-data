Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'.
   - `arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<'.
   - `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `maxi` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi` twice, and then the value of `i` twice.
   - Since `maxi` is 0 and `i` is 1, the output will be:
     ```
     ? 0 0 1 1
     ```

5. **Final Output:**
   Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
