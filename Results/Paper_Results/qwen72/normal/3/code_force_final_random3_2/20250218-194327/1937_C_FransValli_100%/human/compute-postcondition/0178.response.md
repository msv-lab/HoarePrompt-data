Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` must have at least two elements.
   - `item` is the second element of `arr`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)`

3. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `mini` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
   - `item` is the second element of `arr`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will start with the string `?`.
   - It will then print the value of `mini` twice.
   - It will then print the value of `item` twice.
   - The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately written to the console.

Since `mini` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, `item` is the second element of `arr`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the value of the undefined variable `mini` and [item] is the second element of the list `arr`)**
