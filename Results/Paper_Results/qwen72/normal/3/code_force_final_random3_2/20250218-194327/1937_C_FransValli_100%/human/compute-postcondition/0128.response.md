Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<', and `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed. If no element in `arr` resulted in `res` being '>', `mini` remains the first element of `arr`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` remains unchanged**: The variable `n` is not modified within the loop, so it retains its initial value.
- **`i` is `n-1`**: The variable `i` is not modified within the loop, so it remains `n-1`.
- **`maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'**: The variable `maxi` is updated to the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'. If no such element exists, `maxi` may not change or could be undefined depending on the initial state.
- **`mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'**: The variable `mini` is updated to the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'. If no element in `arr` resulted in `res` being '>', `mini` remains the first element of `arr`.
- **`arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<'**: The list `arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<'. This list is not modified by the loop, so it remains as it was initially.
- **`item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed**: The variable `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed in the loop. After the loop completes, `item` will be the last element of `arr` that was compared.
