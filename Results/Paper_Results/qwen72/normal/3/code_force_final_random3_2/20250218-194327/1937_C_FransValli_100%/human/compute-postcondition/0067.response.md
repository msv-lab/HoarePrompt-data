Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least `n` elements, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `item` is the last element of `arr`.**

The code snippet `maxi = 0` explicitly sets the variable `maxi` to 0, overriding its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, `mini`, and `item`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
