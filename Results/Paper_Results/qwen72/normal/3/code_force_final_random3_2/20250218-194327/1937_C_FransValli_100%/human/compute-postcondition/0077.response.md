Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least `n` elements, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is an input string, `maxi` is 2.**

The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `maxi`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `maxi` is now 2.
