Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **`n` remains unchanged**: This means `n` is a constant value that does not change during the execution of the code.

2. **`i` is `n-1`**: `i` is set to the value of `n` minus 1. This indicates that `i` is the last index of the list `arr` if `arr` has `n` elements.

3. **`maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'**: `maxi` holds the index of the last element in `arr` where the comparison result was '<'.

4. **`mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'**: `mini` holds the value of the last element in `arr` where the comparison result was '>'. If no element in `arr` resulted in `res` being '>', `mini` remains the first element of `arr`.

5. **`arr` contains the indices of all elements that were compared and resulted in `res` being '=' or '<'**: `arr` is a list that contains indices of elements that were either equal to or less than the element they were compared with.

6. **`item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed**: `item` is the last element in `arr` that was processed, but it is not used in the print statement.

Given the print statement:
```
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

- **`'!'`**: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- **`maxi`**: This will print the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
- **`mini`**: This will print the value of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'. If no such element exists, it will print the first element of `arr`.

Since the exact values of `maxi` and `mini` depend on the specific elements and comparisons in `arr`, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where [maxi] is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', and [mini] is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists)**
