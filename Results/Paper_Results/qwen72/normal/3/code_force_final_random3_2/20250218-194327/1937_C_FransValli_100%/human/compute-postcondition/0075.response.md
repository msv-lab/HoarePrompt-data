Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least `n` elements.
   - `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
   - `item` is the last element of `arr`.
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1 and `res` is '<'. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0 and `res` is not '<'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `maxi` is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `res`.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

4. **Conditions:**
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1.
   - If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is 0.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will always print the string `'?'` followed by the value of `maxi` twice, and the value of `i` twice.
   - Since `i` is 2, the last two values will always be 2.

6. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1, and the output will be: `? 1 1 2 2`.
   - If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is 0, and the output will be: `? 0 0 2 2`.

Given the initial state, we can't determine the exact value of `res` without additional context, but we can describe the possible outputs based on the conditions provided.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 2 2 (where [maxi] is 1 if `res` is '<' and 0 otherwise)**
