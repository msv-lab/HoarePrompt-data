Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is an input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, `maxi` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `maxi` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 3.
- The initial condition that `n` is an integer greater than 3 remains unchanged.
- The initial condition that `i` is 3 remains unchanged.
- The initial condition that `res` is an input string remains unchanged, and the rule for setting `maxi` to 2 if `res` is '<' or keeping it 0 otherwise is overridden by the new assignment `maxi = i`. Therefore, `maxi` is now 3 regardless of the value of `res`.
