The function `func` operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it interacts with a sequence of test cases, each containing a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices, p_i ⊕ p_j, is maximized. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, the length of the permutation, n, satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

The function returns the pair of indices (i, j) that maximizes the bitwise XOR value for each test case.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to find and return a pair of indices (i, j) for each test case such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices, p_i ⊕ p_j, is maximized. It can handle up to 10^3 test cases, with each permutation length n ranging from 2 to 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^4.**
