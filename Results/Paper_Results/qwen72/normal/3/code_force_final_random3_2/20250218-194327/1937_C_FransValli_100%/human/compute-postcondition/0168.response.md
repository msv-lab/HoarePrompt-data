The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing the value 2. If `res` is '=', `arr` now includes the value 2 as its last element.**
