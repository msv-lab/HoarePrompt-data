Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `arr` is a list containing integers and must have at least `n` elements.
   - `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
   - `item` is the last element of `arr`.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `res` is an input string, and if `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 2. Since the precondition does not specify the value of `res`, we need to consider both cases:
     - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2.
     - If `res` is not '<', the value of `maxi` is not specified, so we cannot determine it precisely.

4. **Output Based on `res` Value:**
   - If `res` is '<':
     - `maxi` is 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If `res` is not '<':
     - The value of `maxi` is unknown.
     - The print statement will output: `? [maxi] [maxi] 3 3`, where `[maxi]` is the unknown value of `maxi`.

Since the precondition does not specify the value of `res`, we need to consider both cases. However, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **? 2 2 3 3 (if `res` is '<', otherwise ? [maxi] [maxi] 3 3, where `[maxi]` is the value of `maxi`)**
