Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing the integers for which `res` was either '<' or '=' during the loop iterations and must have at least `n` elements, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `item` is the last element of `arr`.**
