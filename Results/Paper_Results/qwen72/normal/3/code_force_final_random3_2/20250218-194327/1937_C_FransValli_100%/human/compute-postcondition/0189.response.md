Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` must have at least four elements.
   - `item` is the fourth element of `arr`.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is '>', `mini` is equal to the third element of `arr`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The `print` statement will always start with the character `'?'`.
   - `mini` is determined based on the value of `res`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element of `arr`.
   - `item` is the fourth element of `arr`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element of `arr`.
   - The `print` statement will output the character `'?'`, followed by the value of `mini` twice, and then the value of `item` twice.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be: `'?'`, `mini`, `mini`, `item`, `item`.
   - Since `mini` is the third element of `arr` and `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, the output will be: `'?'`, `arr[2]`, `arr[2]`, `arr[3]`, `arr[3]`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **? arr[2] arr[2] arr[3] arr[3] (where arr[2] is the third element of arr and arr[3] is the fourth element of arr)**
