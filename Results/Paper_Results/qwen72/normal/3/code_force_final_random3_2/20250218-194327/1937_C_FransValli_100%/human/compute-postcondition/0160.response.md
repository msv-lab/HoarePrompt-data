Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', the values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, and `item` remain unchanged.***
