To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
- `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'.
- `arr` is `[0]`.
- `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can start and iterate correctly. The loop head `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and `i` starts from 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this:

- `n` must be greater than 1 (this is already given).
- `i` should be 1 (not `n-1` as initially stated).

The other variables (`maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, and `item`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', `arr` is `[0]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.**
