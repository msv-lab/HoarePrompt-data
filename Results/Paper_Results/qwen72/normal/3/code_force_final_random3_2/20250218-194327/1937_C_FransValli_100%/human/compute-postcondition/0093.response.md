Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `1`, `res` is '='.**

The code `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the end of the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` was `[0]`, so after appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[0, 1]`. The value of `item` is updated to the last element of `arr`, which is now `1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
