Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the first element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the second element of `arr`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `item` is the second element of `arr`, and `res` is an input string with the current value being '>' if the condition is met.***
