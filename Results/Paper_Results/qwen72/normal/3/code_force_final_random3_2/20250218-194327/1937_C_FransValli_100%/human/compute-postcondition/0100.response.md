Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the index of the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]` or `[0, 2]` or `[1, 2]`, `item` is the last element of `arr` which is `0` or `1`, and `res` is the input value.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is either `[0]`, `[1]`, or `[0, 1]`.
- The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the end of `arr`.
- Therefore, `arr` becomes `[0, 1, 2]` if it was `[0, 1]`, `[0, 2]` if it was `[0]`, or `[1, 2]` if it was `[1]`.
- The value of `item` is still the last element of `arr` before the code was executed, which is `0` or `1`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `res` remain unchanged.
