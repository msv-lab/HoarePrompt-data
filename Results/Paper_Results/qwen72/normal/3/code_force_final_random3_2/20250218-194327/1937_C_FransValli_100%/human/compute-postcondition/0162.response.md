Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'.
4. `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'.
5. `item` is the last element of `arr` that was processed.
6. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`.
7. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1]`.
8. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', the values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, and `item` remain unchanged.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?` followed by the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi`, and `i`.
- We need to determine the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, and `i` based on the initial state.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `res` is '<':**
   - `arr` is `[1]`.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'. Since `arr` is `[1]`, `maxi` must be 0 (the only index in the list).
   - `arr[0]` is 1.
   - `i` is 2.

   Output: **? 0 1 0 2**

2. **If `res` is '=':**
   - `arr` is `[0, 1]`.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last element that was compared and resulted in `res` being '<'. Since `res` is not '<', `maxi` remains unchanged.
   - `mini` is the last element in `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'. Since `res` is '=', `mini` remains unchanged.
   - `arr[0]` is 0.
   - `i` is 2.

   Output: **? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 2 (where [maxi] is the value of maxi)**

3. **If `res` is not '<' and not '=':**
   - The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, `arr`, and `item` remain unchanged.
   - `arr` is not specified, so we cannot determine `arr[0]`.
   - `maxi` and `i` remain as they were initially.

   Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2 (where [maxi] is the value of maxi and [arr[0]] is the first element of arr)**

### Final Output:
Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `maxi` and `arr` when `res` is not '<' or '=', we need to consider the most precise description based on the given conditions.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2 (where [maxi] is the value of maxi and [arr[0]] is the first element of arr)**

However, if we assume the most common scenario where `res` is not specified or not '<' or '=', the output will be:

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2 (where [maxi] is the value of maxi and [arr[0]] is the first element of arr)**

If you provide more specific values for `maxi` and `arr` when `res` is not '<' or '=', I can give a more precise output.
