Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`, `i` is `m`, `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` is `m * m`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain the same as they were in the initial state, i.e., they are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6.
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes all `m` iterations, `cnt` will be the sum of the results of the expression `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for each `i` from 1 to `m`. This means `cnt` accumulates the value of `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` for each iteration, where `x` and `y` are updated based on the current value of `i`.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be equal to `m` after the loop completes.
- **`x`**: The value of `x` after the loop completes will be `n - (m * m - m)`, which is the result of the last iteration where `i` is `m`.
- **`y`**: The value of `y` after the loop completes will be `m * m`, which is the result of the last iteration where `i` is `m`.
