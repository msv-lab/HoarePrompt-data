The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `cnt` is not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution. However, for the loop to start, `i` must be set to 1, and `m` must be a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6
- `cnt` is -1

The state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
