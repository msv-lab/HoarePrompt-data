Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if it meets the problem description, which requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
- It correctly returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
- The function initializes `cnt` to -1, which is unusual and suggests a potential off-by-one error.
- The loop iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `m`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- It then updates `cnt` by adding the ceiling of `x / y` and 1 if `x % y == 0`.

### Verification of the Logic:
- The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
  \[
  a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
  \]
  for some integer \(k\).
- This implies:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} = k
  \]
  which means \(a + b\) must be divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Issues with `func_2`:
- The formula used in `func_2` does not directly correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The calculation `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not seem to be derived from the problem's conditions.
- The use of `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
- To correctly count the number of valid pairs, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- A more straightforward approach would be to use a nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and count those that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem. The formula used and the way `cnt` is updated do not align with the required condition.

Correctness: **False**
