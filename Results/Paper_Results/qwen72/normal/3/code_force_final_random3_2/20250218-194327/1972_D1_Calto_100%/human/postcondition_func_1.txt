The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns an integer `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is the sum of a series of calculations performed for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`. For each `i`, the calculation is the ceiling of the division of `(n - (i * i - i))` by `(i * i)`, plus 1 if the remainder of this division is 0. After the function concludes, `cnt` holds the final result of these calculations, and the input variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
