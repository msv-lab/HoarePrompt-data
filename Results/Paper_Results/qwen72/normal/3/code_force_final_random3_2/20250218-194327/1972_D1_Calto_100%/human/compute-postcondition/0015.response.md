The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are both positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns the sum of a specific calculation for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`. The calculation for each `i` is `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` and returns the sum of a calculation for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`. The calculation for each `i` is the ceiling of the division of `(n - (i * i - i))` by `(i * i)`, plus 1 if the remainder of this division is 0.**
