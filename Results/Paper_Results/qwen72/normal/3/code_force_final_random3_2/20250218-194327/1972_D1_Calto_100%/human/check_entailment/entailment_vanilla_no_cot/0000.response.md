Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic within `func_2`, which does not properly count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `x` and `y` does not align with the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Explanation:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function attempts to count the number of valid pairs, but the logic is flawed.
   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking if the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) holds.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

However, this brute-force approach is inefficient for large values of `n` and `m`. A more efficient approach involves using the properties of the GCD and modular arithmetic to reduce the number of iterations.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This solution correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case. However, it is not optimized for large inputs. For a more optimized solution, you would need to leverage mathematical properties to reduce the computational complexity.
