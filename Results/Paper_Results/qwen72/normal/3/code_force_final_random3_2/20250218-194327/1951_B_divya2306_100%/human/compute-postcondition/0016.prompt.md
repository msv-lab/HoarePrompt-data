Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^5`. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `wins` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    wins += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the first element of `a` is greater than the element at index `k - 1` in `a`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `wins` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `wins` is increased by 1, and if `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `wins` is increased by 1, and the program continues without breaking.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
