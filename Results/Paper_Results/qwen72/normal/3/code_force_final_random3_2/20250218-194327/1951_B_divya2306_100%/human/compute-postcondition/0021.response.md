Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is the last index of the iteration (i.e., `n-1` if the loop completes without breaking), `wins` is the number of iterations where `a[i]` was not greater than `a[k - 1]`, `wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.**

The value of `win_with_swap` is now `wins + 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
