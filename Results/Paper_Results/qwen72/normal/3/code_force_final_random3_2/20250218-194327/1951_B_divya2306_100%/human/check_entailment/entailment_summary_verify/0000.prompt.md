You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        wins += 1
    if wins >= k:
        print(wins - 1)
        return
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        win_with_swap += 1
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `max_wins` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of cows), `k` (the index of your cow, 1-indexed), and `ratings` (a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows). It calculates the maximum number of cows whose ratings are not greater than the rating of your cow, such that this number is at least `k - 1`. If the number of such cows is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints and returns `wins - 1`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of cows that can be added to the initial count by swapping, and prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and the adjusted count. The function does not return a value in the latter case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrectness:
The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the maximum number of wins for cow `k`. Specifically, the logic for calculating `win_with_swap` is flawed and does not consider all possible scenarios where swapping could maximize the number of wins.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
```
The expected output is `1`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will produce an incorrect output.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Input:**
   - `n = 6`, `k = 1`
   - `a = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]`

2. **Initial Wins Calculation:**
   - The program starts by calculating the number of wins without any swaps.
   - It iterates through the list and increments `wins` as long as `a[i]` is less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.
   - In this case, `a[0] = 12` is not greater than `a[0] = 12`, so `wins` is incremented to `1`.
   - The loop breaks when `i = 1` because `a[1] = 10` is less than `a[0] = 12`.

3. **Check if `wins >= k`:**
   - `wins = 1` and `k = 1`, so the condition `wins >= k` is true.
   - The program prints `wins - 1`, which is `0`.

4. **Expected Output:**
   - The expected output is `1` because cow `1` can win one match against cow `2` and then lose to cow `3`.

### Correct Logic:
The correct logic should consider the following:
- Calculate the number of wins without any swaps.
- Consider the effect of swapping cow `k` with each other cow to maximize the number of wins.
- For each potential swap, simulate the matches to determine the maximum number of wins.

The provided program does not correctly simulate the matches after a potential swap, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
