The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `wins` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `wins` is increased by 1, and if `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
