To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition `power < log2(n)`. The variables involved in this condition are `power` and `n`.

- **`power` is 1**: This is the initial value of `power`.
- **`n` is an input integer**: This means `n` can be any integer, but for the loop to execute, `log2(n)` must be greater than `power`.

Let's break it down:
- For the loop to execute, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1.
- `log2(n)` is greater than 1 when `n` is greater than 2 (since `log2(2) = 1` and `log2(3) â‰ˆ 1.58`).

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1**
