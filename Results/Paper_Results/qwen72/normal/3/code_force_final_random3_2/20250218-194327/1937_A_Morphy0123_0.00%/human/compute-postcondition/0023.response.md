The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the values of `n_cases`, `i`, `n`, and `power`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the literal value `1` that is passed to it.

Output: **1**
