Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\), `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\).**

### Explanation:
- **`n_cases` is greater than 1**: This condition remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
- **`i` is 2**: This variable also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\)**: This condition is derived from the fact that the loop continues to execute as long as `power` is less than `log2(n)`. After each iteration, `power` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to have executed `power` times, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\).
- **`power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\)**: The loop stops when `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`, which means `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\). This is the final value of `power` after the loop completes.
