Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\). If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\). Otherwise, `power` is updated to the integer such that \(2^{(power)} < n\) and \(2^{(power + 1)} \geq n\).***
