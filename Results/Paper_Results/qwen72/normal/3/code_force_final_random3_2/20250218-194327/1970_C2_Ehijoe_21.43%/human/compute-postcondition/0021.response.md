Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list and must contain at least one key, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` for each `u` and `v` input during the loop contain a list of integers representing the connected nodes, `leaves` is a deque. If `len(nodes[key])` is 1, `leaves` contains the key `key`, and the node `key` has exactly one connection. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque.***
