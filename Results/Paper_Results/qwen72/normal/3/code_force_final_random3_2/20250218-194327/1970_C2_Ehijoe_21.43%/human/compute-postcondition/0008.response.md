The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 1, `nodes[u]` now contains the list [v], `nodes[v]` now contains the list [u]**
