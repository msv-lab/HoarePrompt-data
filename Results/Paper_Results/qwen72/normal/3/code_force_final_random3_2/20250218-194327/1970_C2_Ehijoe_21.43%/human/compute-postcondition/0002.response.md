Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer and always equals 1, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

The variable `empty` is now set to `True`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, and `edges`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
