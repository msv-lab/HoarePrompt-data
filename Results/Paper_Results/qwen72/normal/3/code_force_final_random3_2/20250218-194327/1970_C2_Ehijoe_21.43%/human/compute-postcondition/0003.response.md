Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer and always equals 1, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory set to list, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True.**

The `nodes` variable is now a `defaultdict` with a default factory set to `list`, meaning that any key accessed in `nodes` that does not exist will automatically be initialized with an empty list. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `start`, `edges`, `empty`) remain unchanged.
