The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of nodes in a graph.
- `t` is an integer and always equals 1.
- `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node.
- `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for some graph traversal or operation.

The function returns the result of an operation based on these parameters. However, the specific output is not provided in the given information. Based on the parameters, the function likely performs some graph-related operation starting from the node `start`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`. It returns the result of a graph-related operation starting from the node `start`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph, `t` is always 1, and `nodes` is a dictionary representing the graph's adjacency list.**
