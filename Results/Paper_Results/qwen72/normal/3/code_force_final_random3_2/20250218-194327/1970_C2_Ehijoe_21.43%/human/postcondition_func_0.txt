The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `nodes` representing a tree, an integer `start` representing the starting node, and an integer or `None` `parent` representing the parent node of the current starting node. It returns a list of distances from the starting node to its descendants. If the starting node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor which is its parent), the function returns a list containing the integer 0. Otherwise, it returns a list containing the values of `1 + dist` for each distance `dist` from its children to their descendants, excluding the parent node. The input dictionary `nodes` and the input parameters `start` and `parent` remain unchanged after the function call.
