Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is 1, and the current value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

The value of `sum` is updated to `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
