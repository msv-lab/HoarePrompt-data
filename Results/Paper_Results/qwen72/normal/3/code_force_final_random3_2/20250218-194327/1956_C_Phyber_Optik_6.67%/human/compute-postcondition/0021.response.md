Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, and `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or 0 if it was never true.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0, and `_` remains 0, as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer it was initially set to.
- The variable `sum` accumulates the value of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each iteration of the loop, depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
  - If the condition is true, `sum` is increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
  - If the condition is false, `sum` is increased by `i * n`.
- The variable `r` is set to the last value of `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true. If the condition was never true, `r` remains 0.
