Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `j` is 2.
- `n + r` must be at least 2.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` remains the input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object, so the `print` function will print all the integers in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `n` remains the input integer, the output will depend on the value of `n`.
- The `print` statement will print the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

### Example:
If `n` is 5, the output will be:
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### General Case:
- For any given value of `n`, the output will be the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer)**
