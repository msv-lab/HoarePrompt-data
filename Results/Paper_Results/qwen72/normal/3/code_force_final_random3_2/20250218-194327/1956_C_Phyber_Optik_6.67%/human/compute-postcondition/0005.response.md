Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is true.**

In natural language: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, and the sum of the first `n` positive integers is greater than `i` times `n`.
