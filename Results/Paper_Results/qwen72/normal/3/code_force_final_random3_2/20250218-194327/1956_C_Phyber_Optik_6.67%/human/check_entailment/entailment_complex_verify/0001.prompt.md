You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n×n matrix. The number of test cases t is also given, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅10^5.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is the last input integer, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` for all test cases, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` for the last test case, and `j` is `n + r` for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. It calculates a sum and a value `r` based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`. The function then prints the calculated sum and `n + r`. Following this, it prints a series of lines for each integer `j` from 1 to `n + r`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1` followed by `j` and the integers from 1 to `n`. If `j` is greater than `n`, it prints `2` followed by `j % n` and the integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i, j} \) using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Possible Sum:**
   - The maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times n \) because each element can be at most \( n \), and there are \( n^2 \) elements.
   - However, the problem states that the maximum possible sum can be obtained in no more than \( 2n \) operations, which suggests a more efficient approach.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the sum, we should fill the matrix with the highest possible values.
   - One way to achieve this is to use the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row and each column.
   - By applying Type 1 operations to all rows and Type 2 operations to all columns, we ensure that each element in the matrix is set to \( n \).

4. **Number of Operations:**
   - We need to perform \( n \) Type 1 operations (one for each row) and \( n \) Type 2 operations (one for each column).
   - This totals \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum of the matrix after performing these operations is \( n^2 \times n \) because each element is \( n \).

6. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to \( n \) and updates \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) based on a condition that seems to be incorrect for maximizing the sum.
   - The program prints the sum and the number of operations \( n + r \).
   - It then prints the operations, but the logic for determining the type of operation and the row/column index is flawed.

7. **Flaw in the Program:**
   - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` does not make sense in the context of maximizing the sum.
   - The sum calculation and the number of operations are incorrect.
   - The operations printed do not follow the optimal strategy described above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix. It uses an incorrect logic for sum calculation and operation generation.

Correctness: **False**
