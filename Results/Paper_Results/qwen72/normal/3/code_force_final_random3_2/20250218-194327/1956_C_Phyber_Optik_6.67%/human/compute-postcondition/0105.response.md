Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n + 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`, otherwise `j` is `n + r` where `r` is 0 or 1. `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus the previous value of `sum`, `r` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `j` remains `n + 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`, otherwise it remains `n + r` where `r` is 0 or 1.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `sum` is updated to `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus the previous value of `sum`.
- The value of `r` remains 3.
