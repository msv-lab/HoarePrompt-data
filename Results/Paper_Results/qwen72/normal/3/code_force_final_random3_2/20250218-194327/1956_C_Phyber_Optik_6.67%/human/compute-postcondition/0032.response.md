Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is incremented to 2.
- The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

Given this state, the `print` statement will execute with the values of `1` and `j` being printed, and the `end` parameter set to `' '` (a space).

### Explanation:
- The first argument to the `print` function is `1`, which is a constant integer.
- The second argument is `j`, which is explicitly stated to be incremented to 2.
- The `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that the output will end with a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
Output: **1 2**
