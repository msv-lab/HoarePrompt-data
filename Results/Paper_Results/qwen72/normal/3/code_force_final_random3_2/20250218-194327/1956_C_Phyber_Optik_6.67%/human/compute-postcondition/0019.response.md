The value of `sum` is incremented by the product of `i` and `n`. Given that `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the value added to `sum` is `3 * n`, which is at least 9. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `sum` is increased by `3 * n`**
