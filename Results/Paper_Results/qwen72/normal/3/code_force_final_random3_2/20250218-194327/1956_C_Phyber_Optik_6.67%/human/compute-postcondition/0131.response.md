Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is 0, `_` is `t`, `n` is the last input integer, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` for all test cases, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` for the last test case, and `j` is `n + r` for the last test case.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` is decremented to 0 because the loop has run `t` times.
- The variable `_` is incremented to `t` because it is used as a loop counter in the outer loop.
- The variable `n` holds the last input integer from the last test case.
- The variable `sum` is the cumulative sum of the values computed in the inner loop for all test cases. Specifically, it adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `i * n` for each `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- The variable `r` holds the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` in the last test case.
- The variable `j` is `n + r` for the last test case, and the inner loop prints the required output for each value of `j` from 1 to `n + r`.
