Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `t` is unchanged (not relevant to the print statement).
   - `_` is incremented by `n` (not relevant to the print statement).
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` (not relevant to the print statement).
   - `n + r` must be greater than or equal to 2 (not relevant to the print statement).
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` remains less than or equal to `n`.
   - If `j` is greater than `n`, `j` remains greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first argument to the `print` function is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is `j % n`, which is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.
   - The `end=' '` argument ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determine the value of `j % n`:**
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - The value of `j % n` depends on the value of `n`:
     - If `n` is 1, `j % n` is `3 % 1` which is `0`.
     - If `n` is 2, `j % n` is `3 % 2` which is `1`.
     - If `n` is 3, `j % n` is `3 % 3` which is `0`.
     - If `n` is greater than 3, `j % n` is `3 % n` which is `3`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `2` followed by the value of `j % n` and a space.
   - The value of `j % n` can be `0`, `1`, or `3` depending on the value of `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 [j % n] (where [j % n] is the remainder of 3 divided by n)**
