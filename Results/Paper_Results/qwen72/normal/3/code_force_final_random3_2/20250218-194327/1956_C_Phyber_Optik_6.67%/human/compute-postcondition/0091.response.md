The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `n + r`
- `n + r` must be at least `n + r` (this condition is always true and does not affect the loop)
- `t` is unchanged (this is not relevant to the loop head)
- `_` is incremented by 1 (this is not relevant to the loop head)
- `sum` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop head)
- `r` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is `n` (this needs to be adjusted to start at 1 for the loop to execute correctly)
- `n` is the new input integer (this must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute)

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `i` to start at 1 and ensure `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0**
