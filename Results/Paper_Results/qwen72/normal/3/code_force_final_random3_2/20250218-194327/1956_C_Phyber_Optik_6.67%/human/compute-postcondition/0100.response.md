Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n + 2`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus the previous value of `sum`, `r` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `j` remains `n + 2`.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `sum` is updated to be the previous value of `sum` plus `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `r` remains 2.
