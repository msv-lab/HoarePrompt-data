Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `n + r` must be at least `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is `n`, and `n` is the new input integer.**

Explanation:
- `sum` and `r` are both reset to 0.
- The other variables (`j`, `t`, `_`, `i`, and `n`) remain as they were in the initial state, with `sum` and `r` being the only changes.
