The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` to the current value of `sum`. The expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` will be a positive integer. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `i`, `r`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `r` is 3, `sum` is increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`**
