Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `j` is 2.
- `n + r` must be at least 2.
- `t` is unchanged.
- `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` remains the input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement prints the values of `1` and `j`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- The value of `1` is explicitly 1.
- The value of `j` is explicitly 2.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the values 1 and 2, followed by a space.

Output: **1 2**
