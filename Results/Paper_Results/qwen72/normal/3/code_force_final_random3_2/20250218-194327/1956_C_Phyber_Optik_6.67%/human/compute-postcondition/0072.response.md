Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n + r` must be at least 1.
   - `t` is unchanged.
   - `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` remains the input integer.
   - `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output the integer `2` followed by the result of `j % n`.
   - `j` is greater than `n` (as per the initial state).
   - `j % n` will be the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

4. **Determine the Value of `j % n`:**
   - Since `j` is greater than `n`, the remainder `j % n` will be a value between 0 and `n-1`.
   - However, the exact value of `j % n` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `j` and `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `2` followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.

Output: **2, j % n (where j % n is the remainder when j is divided by n, and j is greater than n)**
