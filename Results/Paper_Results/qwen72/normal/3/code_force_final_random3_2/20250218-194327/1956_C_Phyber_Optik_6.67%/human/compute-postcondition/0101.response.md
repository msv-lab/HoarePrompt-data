Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `3 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, and `r` is 1 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, otherwise `r` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `j` remains `n + r`.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to its current value. 
  - If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` was initially `n * (n + 1) // 2`, so after the update, `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n`.
  - If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` was initially `i * n`, so after the update, `sum` becomes `3 * n`.
- The value of `r` remains 1 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and remains 0 if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
