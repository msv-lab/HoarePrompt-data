To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Function**: The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. **Unpacking**: The `*` before `range(1, n + 1)` in the `print` statement unpacks the sequence, so each integer in the range is printed separated by spaces.

### Variables:
- `n` and `r` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer that `n` is a positive integer because the range function is used with `n + 1`.
- `r` is also a positive integer or zero, but its exact value is not provided.

### Output:
Since `n` is not explicitly defined, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output based on the range function.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n)**

This means the `print` statement will output a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n`, separated by spaces.
