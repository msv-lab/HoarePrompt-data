Postcondition: **`j` is `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is reset to a value less than `t`, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)` is true.**

In natural language, this means:
- `j` is equal to `n + r`.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `_` is set to a value that is less than `t`.
- `sum` is 0.
- `r` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The current value of `n` satisfies the condition that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (i.e., `n * (n + 1) // 2`) is greater than `n` itself.
