Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `t` is unchanged (we don't need to worry about `t` for this task).
   - `_` is incremented by `n` (we don't need to worry about `_` for this task).
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - `n + r` must be greater than 0 (we don't need to worry about `r` for this task).
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first value printed is the integer `2`.
   - The second value printed is `j % n`, which is the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.
   - `end=' '` ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determine `j % n`:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - The value of `j % n` depends on the value of `n`:
     - If `n` is 1, `j % n` is `2 % 1` which is `0`.
     - If `n` is 2, `j % n` is `2 % 2` which is `0`.
     - If `n` is greater than 2, `j % n` is `2 % n` which is `2` (since 2 is less than `n`).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will always output `2` followed by the value of `j % n`.
   - The value of `j % n` is `0` if `n` is 1 or 2, and `2` if `n` is greater than 2.

Output: **2, 0 (if n is 1 or 2) or 2, 2 (if n is greater than 2)**
