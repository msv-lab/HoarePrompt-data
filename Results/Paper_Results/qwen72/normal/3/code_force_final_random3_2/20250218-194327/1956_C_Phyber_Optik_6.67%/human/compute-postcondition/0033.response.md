To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `j` is not directly used in the `print` statement, so its value is not relevant to the output.
   - `n` and `r` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but the `print` statement only uses `n`.

2. **Range Function:**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range object, so each integer in the sequence will be printed separated by spaces.

3. **Output:**
   - Since `n` is not explicitly defined, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be printed.
   - However, the output will be a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n)**
