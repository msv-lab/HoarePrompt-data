Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `n + r` must be at least `n + r`, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` is the new input integer.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `n` is replaced with the new input integer provided by `int(input())`.
- The values of `j`, `n + r`, `t`, `_`, `sum`, `r`, and `i` remain the same as specified in the initial state, with `n` now being the new input integer.
