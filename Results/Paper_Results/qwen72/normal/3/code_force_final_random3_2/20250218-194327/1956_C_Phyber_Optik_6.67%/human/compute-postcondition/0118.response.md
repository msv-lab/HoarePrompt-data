The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the expression `n + r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n + r` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n + r` must still be greater than 0 to ensure that `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is 2, `t` is unchanged, `_` is incremented by `n`, `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` and `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, `n + r` must be greater than 0. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.**
