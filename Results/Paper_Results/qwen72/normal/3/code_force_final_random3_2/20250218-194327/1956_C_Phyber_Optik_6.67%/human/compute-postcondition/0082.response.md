Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n + r` must be at least 3.
   - `t` is unchanged.
   - `_` is reset to a value less than `t`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and the total sum of `i * n` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` remains the input integer.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the integer `1` and the value of `j`.
   - The value of `j` is explicitly given as 3.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output does not end with a newline but with a space.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output `1` followed by `3` with a space at the end.

Output: **1 3**
