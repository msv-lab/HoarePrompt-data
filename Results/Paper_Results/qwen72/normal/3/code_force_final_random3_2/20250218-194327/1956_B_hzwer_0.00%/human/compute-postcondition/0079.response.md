The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. It also accepts a parameter `cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `cases` contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the number of cards each player receives and the integers on the cards in the player's hand, respectively. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the value stored in `dp[0][0]`, which is the result of the dynamic programming algorithm applied to the first test case and the first card in the `cards` list.
