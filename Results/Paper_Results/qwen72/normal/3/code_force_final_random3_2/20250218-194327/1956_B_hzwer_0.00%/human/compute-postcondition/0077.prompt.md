Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the number of cards each player receives and the integers on the cards in the player's hand, respectively. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer. `cards` is a list of integers read from the input. `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
    for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
        elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1]
                )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop. The loop updates the elements of `dp` starting from `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` and moving towards `dp[0][0]`. For each `i` from `n - 3` to `0`, and for each `j` from `n - 1` to `0`, the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards`. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`. `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is -1. The `dp` table has been fully populated according to the rules of the loop, where for each `j` from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive), if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, `dp[-1][j]` is set to `dp[0][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[-1][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[0][j]` and `dp[1][j-1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[-1][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[0][j]`, `dp[1][j-1] + 1`, and `dp[0][j+1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop. `i` is n - 4, `j` is -1. The loop has updated the `dp` table for all values of `j` from `n - 1` down to `0` based on the conditions provided in the loop. For each `j`, if the integer `j + 1` does not appear in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the integer `j + 1` appears exactly once in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If the integer `j + 1` appears more than once in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
