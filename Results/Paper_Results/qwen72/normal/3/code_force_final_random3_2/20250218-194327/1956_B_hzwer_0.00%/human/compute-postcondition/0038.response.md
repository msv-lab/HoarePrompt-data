Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is `n - 1`, and the integer `j + 1` is present in the `cards` list. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[-1][n - 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[0][n - 1]` and `dp[1][n - 2] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[-1][n - 1]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[0][n - 1]`, `dp[1][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[0][n]`.**
