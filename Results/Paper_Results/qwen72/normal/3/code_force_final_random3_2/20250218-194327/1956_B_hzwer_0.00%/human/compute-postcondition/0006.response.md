To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3, and `j` starts from `n - 1` and decrements to 0. Given the initial state, let's adjust the necessary variables:

- `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.
- `j` should start from `n - 1`.

The other variables and objects (`t`, `cases`, `cards`, `dp`, and `i`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 1`**
