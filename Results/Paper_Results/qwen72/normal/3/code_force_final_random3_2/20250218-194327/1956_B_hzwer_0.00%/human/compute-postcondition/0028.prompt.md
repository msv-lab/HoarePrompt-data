Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0, `i` is `n - 3`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` which is now `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` if `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, or `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1)` if `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, or `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1, dp[n - 2][n])` if `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`. `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` which is now `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` if `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, or `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1)` if `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, or `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1, dp[n - 2][n])` if `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is now `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is now `max(dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1)`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is now `max(dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1, dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1, dp[n - 2][n])`. `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` which is now `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` if `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, or `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1)` if `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, or `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1, dp[n - 2][n])` if `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is now `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is now `max(dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1)`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is now `max(dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1, dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1, dp[n - 2][n])`. `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 3`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[i][j]` is now `dp[i + 1][j]` which is `dp[n - 2][n - 3]`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is now `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. If `cards.count(j + 1) > 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is now `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
