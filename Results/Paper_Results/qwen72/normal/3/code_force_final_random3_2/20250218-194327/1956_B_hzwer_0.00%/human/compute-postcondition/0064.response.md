The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is n - 4, `j` is n - 2.**
