Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
2. `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
3. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
4. `tc` is greater than 5.
5. `ppp` is set to 23.
6. `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`.
7. `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains greater than or equal to `r` and less than `N` or greater than or equal to `N`.
8. `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(l, 0, 0)`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(s - 1, s)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `eli` and `LA`:**
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(l, 0, 0)`.
   - `LA` is not explicitly defined, but it is likely an index or a length of some list. For simplicity, let's assume `LA` is a valid index in `arr`.

2. **Determine `s` and `e`:**
   - `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is greater than or equal to `r` and less than `N` or greater than or equal to `N`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(s - 1, s)` will output the value of `s - 1` followed by the value of `s`.

### Conclusion:
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`.
- `s - 1` is simply `s` minus 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`)**
