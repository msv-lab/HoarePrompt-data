Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of the first element in the list `nums` to the variable `num`.
- Since `i` is 0, `num` is now the first integer in the list `nums`.
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`, and otherwise, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 0, num)`. This condition remains unchanged because `num` is now set to the first element of `nums`.
- All other variables (`N`, `i`, `nums`, `s`, `e`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
