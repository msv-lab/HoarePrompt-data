Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), q is an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5), and for each query, l and r are integers (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
