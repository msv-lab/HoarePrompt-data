Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - If `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is set to 23, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `ppp` remains unchanged.
   - `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - The current value of `s` is greater than `l`.
   - `s` is not equal to 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `s` is determined by the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - We know that `s` is greater than `l` and `s` is not equal to 1.
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `s - 1` and the value of `s`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1, `s - 1` will be one less than `s`.
   - The exact values of `s` and `l` are not provided, but we know the relationship between them.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in the list arr, and s is greater than l and not equal to 1)**
