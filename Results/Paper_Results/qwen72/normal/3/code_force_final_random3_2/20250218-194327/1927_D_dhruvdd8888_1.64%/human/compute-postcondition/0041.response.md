Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - If `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is set to 23, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `ppp` remains unchanged.
   - `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - The current value of `s` is 1, and it is greater than `l`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement will always print the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `tc`, `ppp`, `s`, `e`, `eli`, `LA`, or `arr`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
