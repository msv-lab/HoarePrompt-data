Output State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`.
- The code snippet `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` appends a new tuple to `arr`.
- Since `s` is 0 and `i` is 1, the new tuple being appended is `(1 + 0, 1, num)`, which simplifies to `(1, 1, num)`.
- Therefore, if `arr` was initially an empty list, it now contains the tuple `(1, 1, num)`.
- If `arr` was initially a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)`, it now contains both `(1, 0, num)` and `(1, 1, num)`.
- The values of `N`, `i`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, and `num` remain unchanged.
