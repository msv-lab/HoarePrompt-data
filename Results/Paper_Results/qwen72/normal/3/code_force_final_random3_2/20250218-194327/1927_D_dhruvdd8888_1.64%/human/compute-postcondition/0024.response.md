Output State: **`N` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline`, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last integer in the list `nums` (which is `-1`), `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(start, end, value)` represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of `nums` that had the same value, and the value itself.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`N`**: This remains the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline`.
- **`nums`**: This remains the list of integers with `-1` appended.
- **`s`**: After the loop finishes, `s` is set to `N` because the loop iterates `N + 1` times, and the last value of `i` is `N`.
- **`e`**: This remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`num`**: This is the last integer in the list `nums`, which is `-1` because `-1` was appended to the list.
- **`arr`**: This list contains tuples representing the start and end indices of contiguous segments in `nums` where the values are the same, along with the value itself. Each time a new value is encountered in `nums`, a tuple is added to `arr` with the start index of the segment, the current index `i`, and the value `num`. The final state of `arr` will include all such segments found in `nums`.
