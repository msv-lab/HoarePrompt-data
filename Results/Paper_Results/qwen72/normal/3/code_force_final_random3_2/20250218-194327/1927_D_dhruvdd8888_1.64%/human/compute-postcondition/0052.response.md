Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **User Input**: The user provides an integer greater than 0, and two integers `l` and `r`.
2. **Condition on `tc`**: If `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is set to 23, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. However, if `tc` is not greater than 5, the program proceeds without any changes to `ppp`.
3. **Assignment of `s` and `e`**: `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
4. **Constraints on `s` and `e`**: `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and `e` is less than `r`. Additionally, `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the values `-1` and `-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **-1, -1**
