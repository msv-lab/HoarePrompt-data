### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the end of the array.

3. **Building the `arr` List:**
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and groups consecutive equal elements into tuples `(start, end, value)`.
   - Each tuple in `arr` represents a segment of the array where all elements are equal.
   - This part of the code is correct and efficiently groups the elements.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries to determine if a pair of different elements exists within the range `(l, r)`:
     - **If the start of the segment is greater than `l`:**
       - The program prints the indices of the last element of the previous segment and the first element of the current segment.
       - This logic is incorrect because it assumes that the previous segment ends at `s - 1`, which may not be true if the previous segment is outside the range `(l, r)`.
     - **If the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`:**
       - The program prints `-1 -1` because the segment covers the entire range and all elements are the same.
       - This logic is correct.
     - **If the end of the segment is less than `r` and `e` is less than `N`:**
       - The program prints the indices of the first element of the current segment and the first element of the next segment.
       - This logic is incorrect because it assumes that the next segment starts at `e + 1`, which may not be true if the next segment is outside the range `(l, r)`.
     - **If none of the above conditions are met:**
       - The program prints `-1 -1`.
       - This logic is correct.

5. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program includes a special case for `ppp == 23` where it prints the array `nums` and the query `(l, r)` if `tc > 5`. This is likely for debugging purposes and does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - This special case can be removed to clean up the code.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Query Handling:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where the segment starts at `l` and ends before `r`, but there are different elements in the next segment.
  - The program assumes that the previous segment ends at `s - 1` and the next segment starts at `e + 1`, which may not be true for the given range `(l, r)`.

### Correctness:
- The program has logical errors in the query handling section and does not correctly identify pairs of different elements in all cases.
- The special case handling for `ppp == 23` is not relevant to the problem and can be removed.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has logical errors in the query handling section and does not correctly identify pairs of different elements in all cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
