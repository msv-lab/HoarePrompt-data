Postcondition: ***`s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is set to 23, `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`, `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains greater than or equal to `r`. If `s` is greater than `l`, the postcondition remains the same as described. If `s` is less than or equal to `l`, `e` remains less than `N` if it was originally less than `N`, and remains greater than or equal to `N` if it was originally greater than or equal to `N`. `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(l, 0, 0)`.***
