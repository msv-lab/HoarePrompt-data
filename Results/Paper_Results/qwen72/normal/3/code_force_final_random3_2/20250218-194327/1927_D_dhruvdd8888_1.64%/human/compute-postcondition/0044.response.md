Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is set to 23, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `ppp` remains unchanged. `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. If `s` is 1, it is greater than `l`. If `s` is greater than `l` but not equal to 1, it retains its value.***
