Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle queries correctly in all cases. Specifically, the logic for finding a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\) within the given range \([l, r]\) is flawed. The program uses a precomputed list `arr` to store ranges of consecutive equal elements, and then tries to find a pair of indices based on these ranges. However, this approach fails to correctly handle cases where the range \([l, r]\) spans multiple ranges of equal elements.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The program will output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

The program fails to correctly handle the query \((1, 5)\) because it only checks the first and last elements of the range, which may not be the correct approach if the range spans multiple segments of equal elements. In this case, the correct pair \((2, 3)\) is found, but the logic is not robust enough to handle all potential cases.

A more robust approach would involve checking all elements within the range \([l, r]\) to find a pair of different elements, or confirming that no such pair exists.
