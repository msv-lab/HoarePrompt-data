### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the end of the array.

3. **Building the `arr` List:**
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and groups consecutive equal elements into tuples `(start, end, value)`.
   - Each tuple in `arr` represents a segment of the array where all elements are equal.
   - This part of the code is correct and efficiently segments the array.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - The logic for determining the indices of different elements is flawed:
     - **Condition 1: `if s > l`**
       - This condition checks if the start of the segment is greater than `l`. If true, it prints the indices of the last element of the previous segment and the first element of the current segment.
       - This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the indices are within the range `(l, r)`.
     - **Condition 2: `elif e >= r`**
       - This condition checks if the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`. If true, it prints `-1 -1` because the segment covers the entire range and all elements are the same.
       - This is correct.
     - **Condition 3: `elif e < N`**
       - This condition checks if the end of the segment is less than `N`. If true, it prints the indices of the first element of the current segment and the first element of the next segment.
       - This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the next segment is within the range `(l, r)`.
     - **Condition 4: `else`**
       - This condition prints `-1 -1` if none of the above conditions are met.
       - This is correct but can be triggered incorrectly due to the previous flawed conditions.

5. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program includes a special case for `ppp == 23` where it prints the array `nums` and the query `(l, r)` if `tc > 5`. This is likely for debugging purposes and does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - This can be removed for clarity.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly handle all query cases, especially when the segment boundaries are not straightforward.
- The special case handling for `ppp == 23` is not relevant to the problem and can be removed.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has logical errors in the query handling section and does not correctly identify pairs of different elements in all cases.

Final: **False**
