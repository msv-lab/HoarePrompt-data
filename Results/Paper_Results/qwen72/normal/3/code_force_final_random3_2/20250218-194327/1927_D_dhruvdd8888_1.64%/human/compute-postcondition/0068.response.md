Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 1, so the user input is an integer greater than 1.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `tc` is greater than 5.
   - `ppp` is set to 23.
   - `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains greater than or equal to `r` and less than `N` or greater than or equal to `N`.
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to the tuple `(l, 0, 0)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s, e + 1)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is greater than or equal to `r` and less than `N` or greater than or equal to `N`.

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and `e` is greater than or equal to `r` and within the bounds of `N`, the values of `s` and `e` are determined by the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - The `print` statement will output `s` and `e + 1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact values of `s` and `e` depend on the specific tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s` is the first element of this tuple and is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is the second element of this tuple and is greater than or equal to `r` and within the bounds of `N`.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`, and e is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is greater than or equal to `r` and within the bounds of `N`)**
