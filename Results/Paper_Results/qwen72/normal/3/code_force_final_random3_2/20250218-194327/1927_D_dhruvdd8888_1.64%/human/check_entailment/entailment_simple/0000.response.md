### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself.
     - It initializes `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
     - It appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.

   - **Creating Segments:**
     - The function iterates over the array `nums` to create a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple `(start, end, value)` represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of `nums` that had the same value, and the value itself.
     - This is done by checking if the current element `nums[i]` is different from the previous element `num`. If it is, a new segment is added to `arr`.

   - **Processing Queries:**
     - The function reads the number of queries `q` and then iterates over each query.
     - For each query, it reads the integers `l` and `r`.
     - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
     - It then checks the segment at `min(eli, LA)` to determine if there are any different elements within the range `[l, r]`.

   - **Output Logic:**
     - If `s > l`, it means the segment starts after `l`, and the previous element is different from the current segment. It prints `s - 1` and `s` unless `s` is 1, in which case it prints `-1, -1`.
     - If `e >= r`, it means the segment ends at or after `r`, and there are no different elements within the range `[l, r]`. It prints `-1, -1`.
     - If `e < r` and `e < N`, it means the segment ends before `r`, and the next element is different. It prints `s` and `e + 1`.
     - If `e >= N`, it means the segment ends at the end of the array, and there are no different elements within the range `[l, r]`. It prints `-1, -1`.

3. **Edge Cases and Debugging:**
   - The program includes a debugging statement that prints `nums` and the query `(l, r)` if `ppp` is 23 and `tc` is greater than 5. This is not part of the normal execution and is used for debugging purposes.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The segment creation logic is correct and efficiently identifies contiguous segments of the same value.
   - The query processing logic correctly identifies pairs of different elements or reports that no such pair exists.
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the relevant segment for each query.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
