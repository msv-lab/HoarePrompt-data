You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), q is an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5), and for each query, l and r are integers (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `N` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline`, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last integer in the list `nums` (which is `-1`), `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(start, end, value)` represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of `nums` that had the same value, and the value itself.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: [1, 2, 3, -1]
    #State: *`N` is the integer value read from `sys.stdin.readline`, `nums` is a list of integers with `-1` appended, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(start, end, value)` represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of `nums` that had the same value, and the value itself, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is 23, the variables retain their values as described in the precondition.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `int(input())` times. For each iteration, `l` and `r` were updated with new integers provided by the user input. If `tc` was greater than 5, the loop printed `l` and `r` for each iteration where `ppp` was 23 and continued to the next iteration. Otherwise, `s` and `e` were assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. If `s` was greater than `l`, the loop printed `s - 1` and `s` unless `s` was 1, in which case it printed `-1, -1`. If `e` was greater than or equal to `r`, the loop printed `-1, -1`. If `e` was less than `r` and `e` was less than `N`, the loop printed `s` and `e + 1`. If `e` was greater than or equal to `N`, the loop printed `-1, -1`. The values of `N`, `nums`, `arr`, `LA`, and `ppp` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, an integer `n` indicating the length of a list `a` of integers, the list `a` itself, an integer `q` indicating the number of queries, and for each query, two integers `l` and `r` representing the range of indices in `a`. The function returns the results of the queries based on the specified ranges in the list `a`.
