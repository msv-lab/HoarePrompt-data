Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **User Input**:
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.

2. **Conditional Logic**:
   - If `tc` is greater than 5, `ppp` is set to 23, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
   - Otherwise, the program proceeds without any changes to `ppp`.

3. **Variable Assignments**:
   - `s` and `e` are assigned the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - Additionally, `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet provided is `print(-1, -1)`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the constants `-1` and `-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **-1, -1**
