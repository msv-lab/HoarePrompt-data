The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `results`. If `results` has at least three elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `results` must be an iterable with at least two elements, and `result` is the second element in the iterable. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least three elements, and `result` will be the third element in the iterable.

State: **`results` must be an iterable with at least three elements, `result` is the third element in the iterable**
