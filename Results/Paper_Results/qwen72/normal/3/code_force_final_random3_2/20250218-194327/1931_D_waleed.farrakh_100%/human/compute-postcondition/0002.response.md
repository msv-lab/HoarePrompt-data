Output State: **The function is now set up to read from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. None of the variables in the function signature are used, and no other variables have been affected. The variable `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a line of input read from standard input. The variable `t` is assigned the integer value of the first element in `data`. The function is ready to process multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and an array `arr` of `n` integers.**
