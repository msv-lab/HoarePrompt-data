Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The function `func_1` calculates the required pairs by using a frequency dictionary to keep track of pairs of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`. This approach ensures that for each element `a` in the array, it can efficiently find the number of previous elements that form a beautiful pair with `a` by checking the dictionary. The function `func_2` reads the input correctly and processes each test case, calling `func_1` to get the results and then printing them. The logic and input handling seem to cover all the specified requirements and edge cases in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
