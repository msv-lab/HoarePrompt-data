Output State: **`test_cases` remains a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has `n` elements (where `n` is the value from the third tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 0). The variable `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`. The variable `count` is the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` was found in `freq` before the current element `a` was processed. The variable `results` is a list containing the values 0 and `count`, and `a` is the last element of `arr`.**
