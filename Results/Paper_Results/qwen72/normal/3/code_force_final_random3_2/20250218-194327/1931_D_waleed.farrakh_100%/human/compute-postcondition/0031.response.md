Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `results` is an empty list, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq` is updated to include the key `current_pair` with the value 1 if `current_pair` was not already in `freq`, or `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1 if `current_pair` was already in `freq`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1.**
