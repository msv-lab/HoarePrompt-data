### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It correctly processes the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines: the first line contains `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains the array `arr`.
   - It appends the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and prints the results.
   - The state annotations are accurate and describe the program's state correctly at each step.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` and a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through each element `a` in the array `arr`.
   - It calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative. This is correct because it ensures that `rx` is the correct remainder for the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\).
     - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`. This is correct because it ensures that `ry` is the correct remainder for the condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\).
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count`.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the `count` to the `results` list and returns the list of results.
   - The state annotations are accurate and describe the program's state correctly at each step.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic correctly identifies pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x` and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.
   - The use of `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is the correct remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, which is necessary for the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\).
   - The use of `ry = a % y` ensures that `ry` is the correct remainder when `a` is divided by `y`, which is necessary for the condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\).
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the number of elements that have the same remainders, which allows for efficient counting of beautiful pairs.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the maximum number of test cases and the maximum size of the array.
   - It correctly handles the case where there are no beautiful pairs (e.g., the second test case in the example).

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the maximum constraints, as it processes each element in the array only once and uses a dictionary for constant-time lookups.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. The original assessment was accurate.
