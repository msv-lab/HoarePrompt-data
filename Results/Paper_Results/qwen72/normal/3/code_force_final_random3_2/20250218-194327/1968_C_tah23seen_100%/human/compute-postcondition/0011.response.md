Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1, `ans` is a list of length n where the elements from index 0 to index n-2 are updated to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for each i, and `i` is -1.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The integer `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `ans` is updated such that each element from index 0 to index n-2 is set to the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`.
- The loop index `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
