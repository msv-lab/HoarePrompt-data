Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1, `ans` is a list of length n where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is n - 7.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is decremented by 1.
- Initially, `i` was `n - 6`.
- After the decrement, `i` is now `n - 7`.
- The other variables (`arr`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
