The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is `n - 4`, so after the execution, `i` becomes `n - 5`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) = n - 1, `ans` is a list of length n where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is n - 5.**
