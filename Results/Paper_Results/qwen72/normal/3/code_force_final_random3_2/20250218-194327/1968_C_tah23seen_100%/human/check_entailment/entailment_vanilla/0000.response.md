### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).
   - We need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
     - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
     - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to \( 10^9 \).
   - It then iterates backward from \( n-2 \) to \( 0 \) and sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

3. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - The condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) must be satisfied.
   - For \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) to hold, \( a_i \) must be such that when divided by \( a_{i-1} \), the remainder is \( x_i \).
   - The solution sets \( a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i \). This ensures that \( a_{i+1} \) is greater than \( a_i \) and \( a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = x_i \).

4. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The first element \( a_1 \) is set to \( 10^9 \), which is a valid value within the range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \).
   - The loop starts from \( n-2 \) and goes to \( 0 \), ensuring that all elements \( a_i \) for \( 2 \le i \le n \) are correctly calculated.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the case where \( n = 2 \) correctly. For \( n = 2 \), the array `arr` will have only one element \( x_2 \), and the solution will set \( a_2 = 10^9 - x_2 \), which satisfies \( x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1 \).

6. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the array `ans` for each test case, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
