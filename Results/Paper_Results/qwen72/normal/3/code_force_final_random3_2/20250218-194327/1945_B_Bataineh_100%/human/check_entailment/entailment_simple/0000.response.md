### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` which represent the launch frequencies of the two installations and the visibility duration of the fireworks, respectively.

2. **Logic for Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks**:
   - The program uses a series of conditional statements to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is 2. This is because the visibility duration of each firework is less than the launch frequency of both installations, so no more than one firework from each installation can be visible at any given time.
   - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, the program calculates `2 + m // b`. This is because the visibility duration of a firework from the second installation can overlap with multiple fireworks from the first installation, but the first installation's frequency is too high for its fireworks to overlap with each other.
   - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, the program calculates `2 + m // a`. This is similar to the previous case but with the roles of `a` and `b` reversed.
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, the program calculates `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is because the visibility duration of each firework can overlap with multiple fireworks from both installations, and the initial two fireworks launched at time 0 from both installations are also visible.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1. In this case, the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is `2 + m`, as both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - The program also handles the case where `a` or `b` is much larger than `m`, ensuring that the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is correctly calculated.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the given conditions and edge cases. The logic and the conditions used in the program align with the problem description and the expected output.
