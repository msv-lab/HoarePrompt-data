The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition, but based on the parameter constraints provided, it is expected to accept multiple test cases, each with three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`. These parameters are integers, and they must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. The function is likely to return a result for each test case, but the specific output is not described in the provided information.

Given the constraints, the function is expected to process these parameters and produce an output. However, without more specific information about the output, we can only infer that the function processes these integers and returns some form of result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with three integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18), and returns a result for each test case.**
