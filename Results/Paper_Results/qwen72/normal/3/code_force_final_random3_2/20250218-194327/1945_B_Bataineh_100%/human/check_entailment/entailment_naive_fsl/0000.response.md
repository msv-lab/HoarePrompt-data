Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously when the frequencies `a` and `b` are different and `m` is large enough to overlap multiple launches from both installations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
10 15 100
```
- The first installation launches fireworks every 10 minutes.
- The second installation launches fireworks every 15 minutes.
- Each firework is visible for 101 minutes.

The program's logic will evaluate as follows:
- `m < a` is False (100 is not less than 10).
- `m < b` is False (100 is not less than 15).
- The else block will execute, and the program will print:
  - `m // a + m // b + 2` which is `100 // 10 + 100 // 15 + 2` = `10 + 6 + 2` = `18`.

However, the correct answer should be 19. Here's why:
- The first installation launches fireworks at times: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.
- The second installation launches fireworks at times: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105.
- At time 100, the fireworks launched at 90 and 100 from the first installation, and 90 and 105 from the second installation, will be visible. Additionally, the firework launched at 100 from the first installation will be visible for 101 minutes, overlapping with the firework launched at 105 from the second installation.

Thus, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 19, not 18. This indicates that the program is incorrect for this input.
