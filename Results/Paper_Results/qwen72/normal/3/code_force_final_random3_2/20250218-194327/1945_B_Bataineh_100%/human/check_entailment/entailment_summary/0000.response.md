Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky. The key points to consider are:
1. The visibility duration of each firework is `m + 1` minutes.
2. The first installation launches fireworks every `a` minutes.
3. The second installation launches fireworks every `b` minutes.

The function `func` processes each test case by checking the following conditions:
- If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, it means that no two fireworks from different installations can overlap in visibility. Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2 (one from each installation).
- If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, it means that fireworks from the second installation can overlap with each other, but not with those from the first installation. The maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2 plus the number of fireworks from the second installation that can fit within the visibility window `m`.
- If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, it means that fireworks from the first installation can overlap with each other, but not with those from the second installation. The maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2 plus the number of fireworks from the first installation that can fit within the visibility window `m`.
- If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, it means that fireworks from both installations can overlap with each other. The maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is the sum of the number of fireworks from both installations that can fit within the visibility window `m`, plus 2 (one from each installation).

However, there is a logical error in the conditions:
- The conditions `m < a and m > b` and `m < b and m > a` are not mutually exclusive and do not cover all possible cases. For example, if `a` and `b` are equal and both are less than `m`, the program will fall into the "else" case, which is incorrect.
- The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

The correct logic should be:
1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time by considering the visibility window `m + 1` and the launch frequencies `a` and `b`.

Given the current implementation, it does not correctly handle all edge cases and the logic for calculating the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
