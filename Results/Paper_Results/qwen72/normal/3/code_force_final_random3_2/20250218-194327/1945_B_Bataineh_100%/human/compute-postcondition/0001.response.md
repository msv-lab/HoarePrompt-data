The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which already ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, as it is the starting point for the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
