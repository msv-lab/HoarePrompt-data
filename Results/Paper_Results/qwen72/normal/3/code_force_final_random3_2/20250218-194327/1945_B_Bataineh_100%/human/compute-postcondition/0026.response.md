Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are new input integers. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. If `m` is between `a` and `b`, then `m` is between `a` and `b`. If `m` is greater than or equal to `a` or `b`, then `m` is either less than or equal to `a` or greater than or equal to `b`.**
