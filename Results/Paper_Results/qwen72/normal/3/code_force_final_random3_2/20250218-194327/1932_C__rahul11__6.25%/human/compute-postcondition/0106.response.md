The value of `ans` is updated to be `ans * i`. Given that `ans` was initially `1 * i`, the new value of `ans` becomes `i * i` or `i^2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 3, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least 2 integers, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers, each initialized to 0, `ans` is `i * i` or `i^2`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` from the beginning to `n-2`, `r` is `n - 1 - l`, `c` is `n`, `k` is `n - 2`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
