Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` now equal to `ans % m % MOD` and `res[1]` now equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is now equal to the product of all integers in `arr` except `arr[l]`, `i` is the last integer in `arr`, `c` is 1, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and the character at index `k` in `s` is 'L'.**
