Functionality: **The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), and a string `s` of `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'. The function accepts the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and processes each test case, ensuring the sum of `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function returns the processed results for each test case.**
