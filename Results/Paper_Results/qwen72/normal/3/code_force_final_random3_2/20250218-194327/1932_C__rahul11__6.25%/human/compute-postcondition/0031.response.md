Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]`, `res[1]`, and `res[2]` now equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to the product of all integers in `arr` except `arr[l]` divided by `arr[l]` and then taken modulo `MOD`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` if the first character of `s` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `i` is the last integer in `arr`, `c` is 3, and `k` is 1.**
