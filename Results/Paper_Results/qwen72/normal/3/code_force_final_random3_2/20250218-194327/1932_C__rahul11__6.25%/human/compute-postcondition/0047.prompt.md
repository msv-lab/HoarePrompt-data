Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` now equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is equal to the product of all integers in `arr`, `i` is the last integer in `arr`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` now equal to `ans % m % MOD`. If the first character of `s` is 'L', then `res[1]` is also set to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to the product of all integers in `arr` except `arr[l]`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `res[1]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to the product of all integers in `arr` except the last one, `i` is the last integer in `arr`, `c` is 2, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`. In both cases, `k` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros. If `s[k]` is 'L', `res[0]`, `res[1]`, and `res[2]` are set to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to the product of all integers in `arr` except `arr[l]` divided by `arr[l]` and then taken modulo `MOD`, `l` is 2, and `r` is `n - 1`. If `s[k]` is not 'L', `res[0]` and `res[1]` are set to `ans % m % MOD`, `res[2]` is also set to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, and `i` is the last integer in `arr`. In both cases, `k` is 1, `c` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[c]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `s[k] == 'L'`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`. `c` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
