Output State: **_ is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least `n` integers, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers, each initialized to 0, `ans` is the product of all integers in `arr`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` from the beginning to `n-2`, `r` is `n - 1 - l`, `c` is 1, `k` is `n - 2`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is updated to 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
