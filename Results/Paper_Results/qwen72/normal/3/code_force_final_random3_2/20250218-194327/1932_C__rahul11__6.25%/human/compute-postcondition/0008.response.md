Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is equal to the first integer in `arr`, `i` is the first integer in `arr`**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Initially, `ans` is 1 and `i` is the first integer in `arr`. After the multiplication, `ans` is equal to the first integer in `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
