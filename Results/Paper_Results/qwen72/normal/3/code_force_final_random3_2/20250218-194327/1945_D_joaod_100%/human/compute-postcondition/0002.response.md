Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer.** 

The values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input().split()` splits the input into two parts, and `map(int, ...)` converts these parts into integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
