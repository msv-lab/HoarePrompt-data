### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads `na_frente` (number of people in the queue) and `pos_final` (the maximum allowable final position for Kirill).
   - It then reads the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, which represent the costs for Kirill to bribe people.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from each. This is necessary because the problem description uses 1-based indexing, while Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the total cost of bribes.
   - `best` is initialized to `sys.float_info.max`, which is a very large number to ensure that the first comparison will update it.

4. **Loop to Calculate Minimum Cost:**
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` to 0, considering each person in the queue.
   - If the current position `v` is within the range of `pos_final`, the program checks if the current total cost plus the cost to bribe the person at position `v` is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
   - The program then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. This is because Kirill will always choose the cheaper option to move forward.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the `best` cost for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound. It iterates from the end of the queue to the front, ensuring that Kirill can move to any position before his current one at the minimum cost.
- The condition `if v <= pos_final` ensures that Kirill only considers positions that are within his desired range.
- The program correctly updates `best` to keep track of the minimum cost to reach a position within the desired range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
