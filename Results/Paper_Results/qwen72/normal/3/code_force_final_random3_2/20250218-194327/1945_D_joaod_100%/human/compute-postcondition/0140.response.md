Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` ≤ `pos_final`.**

### Explanation:
- **`v`**: The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to -1, so after all iterations, `v` will be -1.
- **`total`**: This variable accumulates the cost for each iteration. For each `v` from `na_frente` to 0, `total` is incremented by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
- **`best`**: This variable keeps track of the minimum cost found when `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. It is updated to the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to 0 where `v` ≤ `pos_final`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
