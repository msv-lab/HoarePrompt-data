Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string `s` contains characters other than 'A' to 'G'. For example, if the input string contains a character like 'H', the program will raise a `NameError` because `default_value` is not defined. Additionally, the program does not correctly account for the required number of problems for each difficulty level. It should ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'), but the current logic only checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m` and then calculates the difference. This logic is flawed because it should be checking if the count is less than `m` and then adding the difference to `ans`.

Here is a test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
10 1
BGECDCBDEH

Output:
NameError: name 'default_value' is not defined
```

And another test case where the logic is incorrect:
```
Input:
1
10 2
BGECDCBDED

Output:
5

Expected Output:
7
```
In this case, the program should output 7 because there are only 1 'A', 2 'B's, 1 'C', 1 'D', 1 'E', 0 'F's, and 0 'G's in the input string. To hold 2 rounds, Vlad needs 1 more 'A', 2 more 'B's, 1 more 'C', 1 more 'D', 1 more 'E', 2 more 'F's, and 2 more 'G's, totaling 7 additional problems. However, the program incorrectly outputs 5.
