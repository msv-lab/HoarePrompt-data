Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 3, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of integers containing the first `x` elements converted from the original list of strings.**

The code snippet `[n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` based on the new input. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and `arr` still contains the first `x` elements converted from the original list of strings. The new values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are now integers derived from the input.
