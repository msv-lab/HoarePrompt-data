Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 3, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of integers containing the first `x` elements from the original list of strings.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr` from strings to integers.
- The length of `arr` is now `x`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The new `arr` contains only integers, and these integers are the first `x` elements from the original list of strings.
