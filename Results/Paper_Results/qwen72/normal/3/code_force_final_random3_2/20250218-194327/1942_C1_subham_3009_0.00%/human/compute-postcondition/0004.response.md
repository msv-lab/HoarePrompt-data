The code snippet takes input from the user and splits it into three values, which are then assigned to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The input values are converted to integers using the `map` function. The initial values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are overwritten by the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer.**
