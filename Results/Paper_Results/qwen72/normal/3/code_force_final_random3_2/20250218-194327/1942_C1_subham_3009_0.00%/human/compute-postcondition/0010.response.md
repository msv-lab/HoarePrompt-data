Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of the first `x` integers converted from the original list of strings.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `[n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, converting each part to an integer.
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `x` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `y` is assigned the third integer from the input.
- The initial state mentions that `t` is an input integer and `arr` is a list of the first `x` integers converted from the original list of strings. These values remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, while `t` and `arr` retain their initial states.
