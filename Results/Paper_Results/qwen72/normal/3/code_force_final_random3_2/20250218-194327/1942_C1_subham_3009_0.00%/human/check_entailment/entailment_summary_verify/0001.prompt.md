You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            print(x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of the number of sides `n` of a regular polygon, the number of vertices `x` chosen by Bessie, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, the function prints the value `x - 2`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. If the script is not executed as the main module, no changes are made to the variables.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the vertices chosen by Bessie. Given that \( y = 0 \), we cannot choose any additional vertices, so we must work with the \( x \) vertices Bessie has already chosen.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input. It reads the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \). It then reads the \( x \) chosen vertices and converts them to integers.

3. **Output Calculation**: The program prints \( x - 2 \) for each test case. This is based on the fact that for any set of \( x \) vertices in a regular \( n \)-sided polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is \( x - 2 \).

4. **Correctness of the Formula**: The formula \( x - 2 \) is correct for the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from \( x \) vertices in a polygon. This is a well-known result in combinatorial geometry. For example:
   - If \( x = 3 \), the maximum number of triangles is \( 3 - 2 = 1 \).
   - If \( x = 4 \), the maximum number of triangles is \( 4 - 2 = 2 \).
   - If \( x = 5 \), the maximum number of triangles is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \).

5. **Constraints**: The program handles the constraints correctly. It ensures that \( t \) is within the range \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), \( n \) is within the range \( 4 \leq n \leq 10^9 \), \( x \) is within the range \( 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) \), and \( y = 0 \).

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case: \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), \( y = 0 \). The chosen vertices are \( 1, 6, 2, 5 \). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is \( 4 - 2 = 2 \).
   - For the second test case: \( n = 8 \), \( x = 8 \), \( y = 0 \). The chosen vertices are \( 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8 \). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is \( 8 - 2 = 6 \).
   - For the third test case: \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), \( y = 0 \). The chosen vertices are \( 1, 3 \). The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is \( 2 - 2 = 0 \), but since \( x \geq 3 \) is required to form at least one triangle, the output is \( 2 - 2 = 0 \) (which is not possible, but the problem specifies \( x \geq 3 \) implicitly).

7. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where \( x < 3 \) explicitly, but the problem constraints ensure that \( x \geq 3 \) for valid test cases.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct for the given problem constraints and inputs.

Correctness: **True**
