The code snippet changes the `arr` list by converting the first `x` elements of `arr` from strings to integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The new `arr` list contains integers from the first `x` elements of the original `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of the first `x` integers converted from the original list of strings.**
