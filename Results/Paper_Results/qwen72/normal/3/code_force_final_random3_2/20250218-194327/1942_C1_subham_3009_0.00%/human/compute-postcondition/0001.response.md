Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is fixed at 0, and the function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving a regular polygon with `n` sides and a set of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie, represented as a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function should return the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices. The program is being executed as the main module.**
