The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `t` is already constrained to be at least 1, it is guaranteed that the loop will execute at least once. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is fixed at 0**
