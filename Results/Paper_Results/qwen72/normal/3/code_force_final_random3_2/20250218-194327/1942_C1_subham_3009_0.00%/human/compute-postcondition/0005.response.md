The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, where each string is an element of the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of strings from the input.**
