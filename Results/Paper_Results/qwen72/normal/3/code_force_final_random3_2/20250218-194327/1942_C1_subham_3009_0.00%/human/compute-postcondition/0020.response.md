Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `x` is the second last input integer, `y` is the third last input integer, `arr` is a list of integers containing the last `x` elements converted from the original list of strings.**

Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be the inputs provided during the last iteration of the loop, and `arr` will be the list of integers converted from the last input string of `x` elements. The initial values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` from previous iterations will no longer be relevant as they are overwritten in each iteration.
