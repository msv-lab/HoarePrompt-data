Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is fixed at 0, and the function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving a regular polygon with `n` sides and a set of `x` vertices chosen by Bessie, represented as a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function should return the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices. The program is being executed as the main module.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    print(x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of the first `x` integers converted from the original list of strings.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of integers containing the first `x` elements converted from the original list of strings.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4 - 3, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of integers containing the first `x` elements from the original list of strings.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
