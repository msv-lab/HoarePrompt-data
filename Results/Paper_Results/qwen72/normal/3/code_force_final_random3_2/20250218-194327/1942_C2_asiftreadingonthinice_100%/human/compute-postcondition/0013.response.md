Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `y` is an integer input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `i` is 1, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.***
