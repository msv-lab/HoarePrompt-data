Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 1`, `y` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `tmp` is an empty list, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `x + y - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
