Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `y` is an integer input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 1`. `i` is 1. `tmp` is an empty list if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not an even number, otherwise `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the difference is an even number but not 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, `ans` is `x + y`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2`. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, and `i` is 3. If the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is 2, `ans` is `x + y + 1`. If the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is an even number but not 2, `ans` is `x + y - 1` and `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. If the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is not an even number, `ans` is `x + y - 1` and `tmp` is an empty list. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, `ans` is `x + y`. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is an even number but not 2, `ans` is `x + y - 2` and `tmp` initially contains the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is not an even number, `ans` is `x + y - 2` and `tmp` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
