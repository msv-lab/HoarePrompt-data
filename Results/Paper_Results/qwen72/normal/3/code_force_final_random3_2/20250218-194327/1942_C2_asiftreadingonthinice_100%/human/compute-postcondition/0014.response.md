Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 1`. `i` is 1. `tmp` is an empty list if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not an even number, otherwise `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the difference is an even number but not 2.***
