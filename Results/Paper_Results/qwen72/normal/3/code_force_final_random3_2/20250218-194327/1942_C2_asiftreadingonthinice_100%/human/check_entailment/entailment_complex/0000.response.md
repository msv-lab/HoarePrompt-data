### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `tt` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, and a list of `x` integers `a` representing the chosen vertices.
   - The function sorts the list `a` to facilitate the calculation of gaps between chosen vertices.

2. **Initial Calculation of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is because each triangle requires 3 vertices, and we start with `x` chosen vertices and can add up to `y` more vertices.
   - The `-2` accounts for the fact that the first triangle can be formed with the first 3 vertices, and each additional vertex can form one more triangle.

3. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The function iterates through the sorted list `a` to find gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it means we can form one additional triangle by adding a single vertex between them, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is an even number greater than 2, it means we can potentially form multiple triangles by adding vertices. The gap size divided by 2 is appended to the list `tmp`.

4. **Handling the Gap Between the First and Last Chosen Vertices:**
   - The function also checks the gap between the first and last chosen vertices, considering the circular nature of the polygon.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is an even number greater than 2, the gap size divided by 2 is appended to the list `tmp`.

5. **Maximizing Triangles with Additional Vertices:**
   - The list `tmp` is sorted to prioritize smaller gaps first.
   - The function then iterates through `tmp` and adds vertices to form triangles as long as `y` (the remaining number of vertices we can choose) is sufficient.
   - For each gap `i` in `tmp`, if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, we can add `i` triangles and reduce `y` by `i - 1`.
   - If `y` is not sufficient, the loop breaks.

6. **Final Adjustment:**
   - After processing all gaps, any remaining value of `y` is added to `ans` to account for any additional vertices that can form triangles.
   - The function prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` because the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles in a polygon with `n` sides is `n - 2`.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes each test case as described.
- The initial value of `ans` is correctly set to `x + y - 2`.
- The function correctly identifies and handles gaps between chosen vertices, including the circular gap.
- The function correctly maximizes the number of triangles by adding vertices to the smallest gaps first.
- The final adjustment to `ans` ensures that the output does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles in the polygon.
