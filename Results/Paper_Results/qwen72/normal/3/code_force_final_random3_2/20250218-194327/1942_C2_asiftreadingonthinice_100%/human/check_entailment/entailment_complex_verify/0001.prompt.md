You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    4 2 2

Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: The loop has finished executing all `tt` iterations. `ans` is the final computed value for each iteration, which is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, plus the sum of all elements `i` in `tmp` where `y >= i - 1`, and finally plus the remaining value of `y`. `y` is reduced by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all elements `i` in `tmp` that were processed in the loop, where `y` was greater than or equal to `(i - 1)`. `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` is the total number of iterations. `a` is sorted in ascending order, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `tt` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` integers `a` representing chosen vertices. It then computes and prints the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the vertices in `a` and up to `y` additional vertices. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `tt` test cases have been processed, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case. The variables `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged for each test case, and `y` is reset for each new test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads the list of vertices `a` that Bessie has chosen and sorts it.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The initial number of triangles `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is because each chosen vertex can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices, and we need to account for the maximum possible number of triangles.

3. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices `a` to find gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap between two consecutive vertices is exactly 2, it means a triangle can be formed by adding a single vertex in between, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is even, the function calculates the number of vertices that can be added to form triangles and appends this number to the list `tmp`.

4. **Handling the Gap Between the Last and First Vertex**:
   - The function checks the gap between the last and first vertex in the sorted list `a` (considering the polygon is cyclic).
   - If this gap is exactly 2, it means a triangle can be formed by adding a single vertex, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is even, the function calculates the number of vertices that can be added to form triangles and appends this number to the list `tmp`.

5. **Optimizing the Number of Triangles**:
   - The list `tmp` is sorted to prioritize the smallest gaps first.
   - The function iterates through `tmp` and adds vertices to form triangles as long as `y` (the remaining vertices you can choose) is sufficient.
   - For each gap in `tmp`, if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, it adds `i` to `ans` and decreases `y` by `i - 1`.
   - If `y` is not sufficient, the loop breaks.

6. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The function adds any remaining `y` to `ans` to account for any additional vertices that can be chosen.
   - The final answer is the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`, ensuring that the number of triangles does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles in a polygon with `n` sides.

### Correctness:
The program appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem correctly. It handles the gaps between chosen vertices and optimizes the number of triangles by choosing the smallest gaps first. The final adjustment ensures that the number of triangles does not exceed the maximum possible number.

However, there is a potential issue with the initial calculation of `ans`. The formula `x + y - 2` assumes that every chosen vertex can form a triangle, which may not always be the case. For example, if the chosen vertices are adjacent, they cannot form a triangle with each other. Therefore, the initial value of `ans` should be more carefully calculated based on the actual configuration of the chosen vertices.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw in the initial calculation of `ans`, which may lead to incorrect results in some cases. The initial value of `ans` should be more carefully determined based on the actual configuration of the chosen vertices.
