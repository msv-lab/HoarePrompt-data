Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `i` is the last element of `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` is now an empty list.**

The code snippet `tmp = []` resets the list `tmp` to an empty list. This change affects the state of `tmp`, but all other variables and conditions remain the same. The variable `i` still refers to the last element of `tmp` that was processed before `tmp` was reset, and `tmp` must have had at least one element before this change.
