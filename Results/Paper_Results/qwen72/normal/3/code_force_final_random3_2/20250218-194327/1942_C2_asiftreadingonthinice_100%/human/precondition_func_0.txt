The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
