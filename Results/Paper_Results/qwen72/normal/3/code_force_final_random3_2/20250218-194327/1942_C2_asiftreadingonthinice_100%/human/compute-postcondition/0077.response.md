Postcondition: ***`ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not 2. `y` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, and `tmp` is an empty list or a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number.***
