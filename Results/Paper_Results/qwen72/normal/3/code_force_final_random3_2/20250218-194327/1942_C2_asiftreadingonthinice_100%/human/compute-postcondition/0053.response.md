Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The loop has finished executing.
   - `ans` is increased by the value of `y`.
   - `y` remains unchanged.
   - The values of `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(min(ans, n - 2))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `ans` is a variable that has been increased by the value of `y` after the loop has finished executing.
   - `n` is a variable whose value remains unchanged.
   - The `min` function will return the smaller of the two values: `ans` and `n - 2`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `ans` has been increased by `y`, the exact value of `ans` is not explicitly known without knowing the initial value of `ans` and the value of `y`.
   - However, the value of `n - 2` is known to be `n - 2` because `n` remains unchanged.
   - The `min` function will compare `ans` (which is `initial_ans + y`) and `n - 2`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The output will be the smaller of the two values: `ans` (which is `initial_ans + y`) and `n - 2`.
   - Since the exact values of `initial_ans` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **min(ans, n - 2) (where ans is the value of ans after being increased by y, and n is the unchanged value of n)**
