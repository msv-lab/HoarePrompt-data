Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order. `ans` is `x + y - 1 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2 + i` if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + count_of_pairs_with_difference_2 + i`. If `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. If `y < i - 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged unless `y >= i - 1`. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the current `i`. `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`.**

In natural language: The value of `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged. If `y` was initially greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `y` is now `y - (i - 1)`. The list `tmp` and the variable `i` still follow their initial definitions. The value of `ii` is still `tt`, and `tt` is still greater than `ii`. The value of `ans` is still determined based on the initial conditions. The list `a` remains sorted in ascending order.
