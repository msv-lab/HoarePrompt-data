Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that have an even difference greater than 2. If the difference between `a[0] + n` and `a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` also includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`. `y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `y >= i - 1`, `y` is decreased by `i - 1` and `ans` is incremented by `i`, with `y` now being greater than or equal to 0. If `y < i - 1`, `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that have an even difference greater than 2, and if the difference between `a[0] + n` and `a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` also includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`. `y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the first element of `tmp`, and `tmp` must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, and if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is further incremented by `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. If `y < i - 1`, `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the second element of `tmp`, and `tmp` must have at least two elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, and if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is further incremented by `i`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. If `y < i - 1`, `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the third element of `tmp`, and `tmp` must have at least three elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
