Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, and `i` is 3. If the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is 2, `ans` is `x + y + 1`. If the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is an even number but not 2, `ans` is `x + y - 1` and `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. If the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is not an even number, `ans` is `x + y - 1` and `tmp` is an empty list. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, `ans` is `x + y`. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is an even number but not 2, `ans` is `x + y - 2` and `tmp` initially contains the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is not an even number, `ans` is `x + y - 2` and `tmp` is an empty list.***
