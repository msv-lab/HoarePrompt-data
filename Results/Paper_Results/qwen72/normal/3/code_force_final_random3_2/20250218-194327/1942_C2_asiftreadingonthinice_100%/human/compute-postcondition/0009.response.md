Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `y` is an integer input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 1`, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, making it `x + y - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
