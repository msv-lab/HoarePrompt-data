Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is `x + y - 1`, `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `i` is 1, `tmp` is now an empty list, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `x + y - 1`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
