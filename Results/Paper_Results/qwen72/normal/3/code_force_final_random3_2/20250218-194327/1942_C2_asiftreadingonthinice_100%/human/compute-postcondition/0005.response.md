Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `y` is an integer input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is `x + y - 2`.** 

The value of `ans` is calculated as `x + y - 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
