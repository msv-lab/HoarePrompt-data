The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `tmp`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `tmp`. If `tmp` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again with `i` set to the next element in `tmp`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `tmp`, and `tmp` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `tmp` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element of `tmp`.

State: **`ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, and if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `y >= i - 1`, `y` is decreased by `i - 1` and `ans` is incremented by `i`, with `y` now being greater than or equal to 0. If `y < i - 1`, `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that have an even difference greater than 2, and if the difference between `a[0] + n` and `a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `tmp` also includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`. `y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the second element of `tmp`, and `tmp` must have at least two elements.**
