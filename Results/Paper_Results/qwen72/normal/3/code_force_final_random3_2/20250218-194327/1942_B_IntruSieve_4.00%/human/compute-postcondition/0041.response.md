The only objects in the loop head are the list `mex` and the variable `itm`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `mex`. If `mex` has at least three elements, the loop can execute one more time with `itm` being the third element of `mex`.

At the end of the last iteration, `mex` contains at least two elements, and `itm` is the second element of `mex`. For the loop to execute one more time, `mex` must have at least three elements, and `itm` will be the third element of `mex`.

State: **`mex` is a list containing at least three elements, `itm` is the third element of `mex`**
