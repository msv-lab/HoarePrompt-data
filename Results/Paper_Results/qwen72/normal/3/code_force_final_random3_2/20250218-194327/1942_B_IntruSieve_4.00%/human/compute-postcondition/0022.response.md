Postcondition: ***`maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus 1, `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either `[0, 0]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus 1 and `0`, `minn` is 1 or 2, `i` is 1. If `minn` was initially equal to `maxx`, `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is `[0, 0]`, `minn` is 2, and `minn` is no longer equal to `maxx`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus 1 if it is greater than the current `maxx`, and `mex` contains the absolute value of `arr[i]` minus 1 and `0`.***
