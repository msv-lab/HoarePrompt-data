The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of `n` integers. It processes the list to generate a new list `mex` where each element is either `0` if the corresponding element in `arr` is positive, or the absolute difference between the element in `arr` and a running minimum value `minn` if the element is non-positive. The function then prints each element of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.
