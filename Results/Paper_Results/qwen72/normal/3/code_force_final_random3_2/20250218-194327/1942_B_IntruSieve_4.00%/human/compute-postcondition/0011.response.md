Postcondition: ***`maxx` is 0, `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing `[0]`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, `minn` is no longer equal to `maxx`. Otherwise, the values and relationships of the variables remain unchanged.***
