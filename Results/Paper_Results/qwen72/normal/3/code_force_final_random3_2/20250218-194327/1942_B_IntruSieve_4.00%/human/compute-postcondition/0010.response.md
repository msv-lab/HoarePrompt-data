Output State: **`maxx` is 0, `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing `[0]`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0. Additionally, `minn` is no longer equal to `maxx`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`.
- Since `maxx` is 0, `minn` becomes 1.
- The other variables (`maxx`, `func_1`, `n`, `arr`, `mex`, `i`, and the current value of `arr[i]`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `minn` is equal to `maxx` is no longer valid, as `minn` is now 1 and `maxx` is still 0.
