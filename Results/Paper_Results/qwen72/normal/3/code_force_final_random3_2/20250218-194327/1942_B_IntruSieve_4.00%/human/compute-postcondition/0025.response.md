Postcondition: **`maxx` is 0 or updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1), `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` now contains an additional element which is the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn`, `minn` is 0 or 1, `i` is 1. If the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to this absolute value.**
