Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic for constructing the permutation `p` from the array `a` is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

### Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

### Actual Output:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

### Analysis:
The program constructs the `mex` array based on the values in `arr`, but it does not correctly ensure that the permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for all `i`.

For the input `1 1 -2 1 2`, the expected permutation is `0 1 4 2 3`, but the program outputs `0 1 2 3 4`, which does not satisfy the condition for `a_3`:
- `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1` (expected: `a_3 = -2`).

The program fails to correctly handle the case where `arr[i]` is negative, and it does not correctly adjust the `mex` values to ensure the condition is met for all elements in `arr`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
