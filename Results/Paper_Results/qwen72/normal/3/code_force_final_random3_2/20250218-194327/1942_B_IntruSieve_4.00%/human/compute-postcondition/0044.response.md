The given `print()` statement does not contain any arguments, which means it will simply print a newline character.

Given the initial state:
- `mex` is a list containing all its elements.
- The loop has printed each element of `mex` exactly once, separated by spaces.

The `print()` statement will print a newline character, effectively moving the cursor to the next line.

Output: **(a newline character)**
