Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

[MOOO! - Doja Cat](https://soundcloud.com/amalaofficial/mooo)

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. The function should take parameters to match the problem description, such as `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` for the length of the permutation and array, and `a` for the array of integers. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and `a` for each test case.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: `maxx` is the maximum value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for all `arr[i] <= 0` in the list `arr`. `func_1` is not properly defined. `n` is an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `mex` is a list containing the values `0` for each `arr[i] > 0` and `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each `arr[i] <= 0`. `minn` is the number of positive elements in `arr` plus 1 if the last positive element was equal to the current `minn` value. `i` is `n-1`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: `mex` is a list containing all its elements, and the loop has printed each element of `mex` exactly once, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of `n` integers. It processes the list to generate a new list `mex` where each element is either `0` if the corresponding element in `arr` is positive, or the absolute difference between the element in `arr` and a running minimum value `minn` if the element is non-positive. The function then prints each element of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.
