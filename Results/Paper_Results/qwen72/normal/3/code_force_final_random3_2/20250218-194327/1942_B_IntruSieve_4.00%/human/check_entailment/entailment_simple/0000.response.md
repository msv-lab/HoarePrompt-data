Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, but it is not defined to take any parameters. This is a significant issue because the function needs to handle multiple test cases, and each test case has its own `n` and `a`.
   - The function should be defined to take `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples containing `n` and `a` for each test case).

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
   - The program attempts to construct the permutation `p` by maintaining a list `mex` that tracks the MEX values.
   - For each element in `arr`, if `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
   - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `mex` as the permutation `p`.
   - However, the variable `mex` is not actually the permutation `p` but rather a list of values that are supposed to help in constructing `p`.

4. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is flawed. It does not ensure that the constructed permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `1 1 -2 1 2`, the program should output a permutation like `0 1 4 2 3`.
   - However, the current logic does not produce this output. Instead, it produces a different sequence that does not satisfy the given conditions.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, you need to maintain a set of used numbers and a set of available numbers.
   - For each `a_i`, you need to determine the correct `p_i` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - This involves carefully managing the MEX calculation and ensuring that the permutation is valid.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
