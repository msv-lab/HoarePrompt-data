You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of `n` integers. It processes the list to generate a new list `mex` where each element is either `0` if the corresponding element in `arr` is positive, or the absolute difference between the element in `arr` and a running minimum value `minn` if the element is non-positive. The function then prints each element of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that the above condition holds for each `a_i`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes two variables `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the smallest and largest values in the permutation `p` respectively.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates over each element `a_i` in the array `a`.
   - If `a_i` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn` by 1. This is because if `a_i` is positive, it implies that `p_i` is the smallest missing integer (MEX) in the current prefix of `p`.
   - If `a_i` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary. This is because if `a_i` is negative, it implies that `p_i` is a value that is not the smallest missing integer but rather a larger value that has not appeared yet.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `p` (stored in `mex`), the program prints the elements of `mex`.

5. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the program with the provided example:
     - For the first test case: `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
       - `a_1 = 1` implies `p_1 = 0` (since MEX of [0] is 1 and 1 - 0 = 1).
       - `a_2 = 1` implies `p_2 = 1` (since MEX of [0, 1] is 2 and 2 - 1 = 1).
       - `a_3 = -2` implies `p_3 = 4` (since MEX of [0, 1, 4] is 2 and 2 - 4 = -2).
       - `a_4 = 1` implies `p_4 = 2` (since MEX of [0, 1, 4, 2] is 3 and 3 - 2 = 1).
       - `a_5 = 2` implies `p_5 = 3` (since MEX of [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is 5 and 5 - 3 = 2).
     - The output is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

   - For the second test case: `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - `a_1 = 1` implies `p_1 = 0` (since MEX of [0] is 1 and 1 - 0 = 1).
     - `a_2 = 1` implies `p_2 = 1` (since MEX of [0, 1] is 2 and 2 - 1 = 1).
     - `a_3 = 1` implies `p_3 = 2` (since MEX of [0, 1, 2] is 3 and 3 - 2 = 1).
     - `a_4 = 1` implies `p_4 = 3` (since MEX of [0, 1, 2, 3] is 4 and 4 - 3 = 1).
     - `a_5 = 1` implies `p_5 = 4` (since MEX of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] is 5 and 5 - 4 = 1).
     - The output is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is correct.

   - For the third test case: `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
     - `a_1 = -2` implies `p_1 = 2` (since MEX of [2] is 0 and 0 - 2 = -2).
     - `a_2 = 1` implies `p_2 = 0` (since MEX of [2, 0] is 1 and 1 - 0 = 1).
     - `a_3 = 2` implies `p_3 = 1` (since MEX of [2, 0, 1] is 3 and 3 - 1 = 2).
     - The output is `[2, 0, 1]`, which is correct.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions for the array `a`.
   - The logic and the implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.
