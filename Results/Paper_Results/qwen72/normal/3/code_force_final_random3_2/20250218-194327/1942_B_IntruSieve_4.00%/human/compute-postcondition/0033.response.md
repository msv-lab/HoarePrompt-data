Output State: **`maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[2] - minn)`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either `[0, 0]` or the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1) and `0`, and the absolute value of `arr[2]` minus `minn`, `minn` is 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 2. If `arr[2]` is greater than 0, `mex` is `[0, 0, abs(arr[2] - minn)]`, `minn` is 2, and `minn` is no longer equal to `maxx`. If `arr[2]` is less than or equal to 0, `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of `arr[2]` minus `minn` (which is 0 or 1) if it is greater than the current `maxx`, and `mex` contains the absolute value of `arr[2]` minus `minn`, `0`, and `abs(arr[2] - minn)`.**
