Output State: **`maxx` is equal to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn`, `func_1` is not properly defined, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` (which is 0), `minn` is 0, `i` is 0, and the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn` is greater than `maxx`.**

Explanation: The value of `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr` minus `minn`. Since `minn` is 0, `maxx` is now equal to the absolute value of the element at index `i` of `arr`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
