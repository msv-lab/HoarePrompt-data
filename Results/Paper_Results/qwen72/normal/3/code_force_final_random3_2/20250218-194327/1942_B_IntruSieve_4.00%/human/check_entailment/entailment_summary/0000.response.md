Reasoning:  
The program provided is intended to solve the problem of reconstructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given conditions. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation that make the program incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of an array is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. The program does not correctly calculate the MEX. Instead, it uses a running minimum `minn` and a running maximum `maxx`, which do not accurately represent the MEX of the prefix of the permutation `p`.

2. **Incorrect Permutation Construction**:
   - The program constructs the `mex` list by appending either `minn` or `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to it, but this does not ensure that the resulting `mex` list corresponds to a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

3. **Output Mismatch**:
   - The program prints the `mex` list, which is not the permutation `p` but rather an intermediate list used in the incorrect logic. The output should be the permutation `p` itself, not the `mex` list.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Maintain a set of used numbers to ensure that each number from `0` to `n-1` appears exactly once in the permutation `p`.
- Calculate the MEX of the prefix of `p` correctly.
- Use the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` to determine the value of `p_i`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
