The only variables in the loop head are `e` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `e` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is 1 and `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `t` must still be greater than `e`.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**
