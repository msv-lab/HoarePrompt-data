Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `l-1` (the last index of the list `nums`). The variable `x` will hold the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and the variable `y` will hold the minimum value found in the list `nums`. The variables `t` and `e` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
