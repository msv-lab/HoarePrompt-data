Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `y` is 100000000. If `nums[0]` < 100000000, then `y` is updated to `nums[0]` and `x` is set to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` > 0, otherwise `x` remains 0. If `nums[0]` >= 100000000, `y` remains 100000000 and `x` is set to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` > 0, otherwise `x` remains 0.***
