Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `y` is `nums[0]`, `x` is `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` > 0, otherwise `x` is 0.** 

The value of `y` is updated to `nums[0]`, and `x` is set to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
