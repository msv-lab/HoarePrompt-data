Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.**

The code snippet `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` updates the `nums` list to contain the integers provided by the user. The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but `nums` now contains the new list of integers input by the user. The values of `x` and `y` will be recalculated based on the new `nums` list if they are used in subsequent code.
