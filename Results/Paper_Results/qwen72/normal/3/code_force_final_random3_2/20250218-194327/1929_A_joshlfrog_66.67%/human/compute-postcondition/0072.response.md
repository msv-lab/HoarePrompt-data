Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This value is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `e` is 2. This value is not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - `l` is a new input integer. This value is used to determine the index `i` in the `nums` list.
   - `nums` is a list of integers input by the user. The exact values of the elements in `nums` are not specified, but they are integers.
   - `i` is calculated as `l - 1`. This means `i` is the index of the element in `nums` that is one position before the `l`-th element.
   - `x` is the maximum value in the `nums` list.
   - `y` is the minimum value in the `nums` list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x - y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will output the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) in the `nums` list.
   - The values of `x` and `y` are determined by the elements in the `nums` list, which are provided by the user.

Since the exact values of the elements in `nums` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the maximum and minimum values in the list.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the `nums` list and y is the minimum value in the `nums` list)**
