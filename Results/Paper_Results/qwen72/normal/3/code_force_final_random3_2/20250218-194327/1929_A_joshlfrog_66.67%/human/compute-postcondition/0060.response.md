Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer that must be at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, and `y` is 100000000. If `nums[0]` < `y`, `y` is updated to `nums[0]` and `x` is 0 if `nums[0]` <= 0, otherwise `x` is `nums[0]`. If `nums[0]` >= `y`, `y` remains 100000000 and `x` is 0 if `nums[0]` <= 0, otherwise `x` is `nums[0]`.***
