The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `l` is the new input integer that must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `l` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer that must be at least 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, and `y` is either 100000000 or the value of `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` (whichever is smaller). `x` is either 0, `nums[0]`, or `nums[1]` based on the initial conditions.**
