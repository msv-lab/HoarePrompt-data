Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x // 2` which is the integer division of `x` by 2, and `i` is `t - 1`.**

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the initial condition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 remains true. For each of the `t` test cases, the variable `x` is assigned an integer value between 2 and 1000, and the variable `y` is assigned the integer division of `x` by 2 (i.e., `x // 2`). The loop index `i` will have reached the value `t - 1`, which is the last index before the loop terminates. The loop will have printed the value of `y` for each of the `t` test cases.
