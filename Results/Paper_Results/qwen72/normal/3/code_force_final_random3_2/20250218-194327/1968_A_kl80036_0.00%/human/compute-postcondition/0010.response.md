Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is an input integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x // 2`, `i` is 2, and `t` must be greater than 1.**

The code snippet `y = x // 2` updates the value of `y` to be the integer division of `x` by 2. Since `x` is an input integer between 2 and 1000, `y` will be an integer between 1 and 500. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `t` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
