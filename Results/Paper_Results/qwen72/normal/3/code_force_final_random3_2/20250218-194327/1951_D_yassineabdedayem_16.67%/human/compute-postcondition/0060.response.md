Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 0, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

The value of `number` is now set to `Min`, which is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
