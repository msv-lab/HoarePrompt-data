The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop will run `t` times. The state of `t` is the only one that can be adjusted to determine whether the loop will execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop uses `range(t)`, the value of `t` is not modified by the loop itself, but the loop counter (represented by `_`) is incremented by 1 for each iteration. However, the loop counter is not part of the state we need to track.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is still greater than 0, and the loop counter is incremented, but since the loop counter is not explicitly named, we do not need to modify it in the state.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all the `number` values computed during the loop. If `k` is 0, all elements of `tab` have been printed. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0 and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` for each iteration.**
