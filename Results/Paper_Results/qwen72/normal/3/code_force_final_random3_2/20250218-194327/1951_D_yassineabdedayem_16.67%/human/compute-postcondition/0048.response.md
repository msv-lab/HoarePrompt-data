Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, `tab` is a list containing all the string representations of the `number` values computed during the loop, and all elements of `tab` have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` is still greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- The variable `k` is still 0.
- The variable `rep` is still 60 or less.
- The variable `number` is still the last value of either `Min` or `Max` that was computed in the loop.
- The list `tab` contains all the string representations of the `number` values that were computed during the loop.
- All the elements in the list `tab` have been printed, one after another, separated by spaces.
