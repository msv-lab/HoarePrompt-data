Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60).
- `tab` must have at least one element.
- `i` is the first element of `tab`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

Since `i` is the first element of `tab`, and `tab` is guaranteed to have at least one element, the value of `i` is the first element of `tab`.

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the first element of the list `tab`)**
