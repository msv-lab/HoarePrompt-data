Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is updated to `0`. Otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k` is updated to `k - Min`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, so `rep` is now 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain unchanged.
- The conditions and logic for updating `n`, `number`, and `k` are still valid as they were in the initial state.
