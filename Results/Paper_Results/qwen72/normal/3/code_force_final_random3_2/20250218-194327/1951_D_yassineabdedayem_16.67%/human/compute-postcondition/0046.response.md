The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tab`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `tab`. If `tab` has at least three elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` contains at least two string representations of `number` values, and `i` is the second element of `tab`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element of `tab`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `number` is the last value of either `Min` or `Max` computed in the loop, `tab` is a list containing at least three string representations of `number` values, `i` is the third element of `tab`**
