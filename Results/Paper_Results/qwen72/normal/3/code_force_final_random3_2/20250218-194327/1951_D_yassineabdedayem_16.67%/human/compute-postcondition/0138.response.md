Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, and `tab` now has an additional element which is the string representation of `number`. `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- `rep` remains 2.
- `tab` remains a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, with an additional element which is the string representation of `number`.
- `Min` and `Max` are still defined as `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively.
- The conditions for updating `k` and `number` remain the same, but `n` has been updated, so the values of `Min` and `Max` may change in subsequent calculations.
