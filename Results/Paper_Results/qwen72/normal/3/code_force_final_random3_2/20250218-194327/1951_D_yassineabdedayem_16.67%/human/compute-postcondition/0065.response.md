Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is updated to `k - k`. Otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k` is updated to `k - Min`.***
