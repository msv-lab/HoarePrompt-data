The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, and an additional parameter `t` which represents the number of test cases. Each of `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

The function returns different outputs based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the example. Assuming the function is designed to handle multiple test cases and return a result for each, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output conditions are not provided.**
