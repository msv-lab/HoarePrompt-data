Initial State: `n` and `k` are defined and have specific values.

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet:
```
Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
```

1. `n // k` performs integer division of `n` by `k`.
2. `int(n / k)` performs floating-point division of `n` by `k` and then converts the result to an integer.
3. `min(n // k, k)` assigns the smaller of the two values to `Min`.
4. `max(int(n / k), k)` assigns the larger of the two values to `Max`.

Output State: **`Min` is the smaller of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the larger of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**
