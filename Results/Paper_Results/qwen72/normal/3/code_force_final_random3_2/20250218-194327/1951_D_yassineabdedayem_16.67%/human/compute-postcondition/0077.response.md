Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing two string representations, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, and `k` is updated to `k - Min` or `k - Max` based on the conditions. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`. Otherwise, `tab` contains the string representation of `Max` and `k` is updated to `k - Min`.**

To break it down:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- `rep` remains 1.
- `tab` remains a list containing two string representations.
- `Min` remains the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` remains the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- `k` is updated to `k - Min` or `k - Max` based on the conditions.
- If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`.
- Otherwise, `tab` contains the string representation of `Max` and `k` is updated to `k - Min`.
