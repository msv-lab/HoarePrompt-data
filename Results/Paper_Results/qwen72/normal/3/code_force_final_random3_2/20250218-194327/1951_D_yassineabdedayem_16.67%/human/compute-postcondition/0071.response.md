Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer and `k` must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than or equal to `k`, `number` is equal to `Min`.**

In natural language: The variable `number` is now equal to `Min`. All other conditions and variable values from the initial state remain unchanged.
