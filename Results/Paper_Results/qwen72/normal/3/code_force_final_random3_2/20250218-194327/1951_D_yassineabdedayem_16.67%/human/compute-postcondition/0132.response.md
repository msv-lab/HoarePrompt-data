Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min` and greater than `Max` or `Min` depending on the condition, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min`.**

Explanation:
- `number` is assigned the value of `Min`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.
- `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, so `number` now holds the value of `Min`.
