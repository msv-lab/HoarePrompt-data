Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is updated to `0`. Otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k` is updated to `k - Min`.**

Explanation:
- `tab` is updated to include a single string representation of `number`.
- The value of `number` is determined based on the conditions:
  - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is set to `0`.
  - Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is set to `k - Min`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `rep`, `Min`, and `Max`) retain their initial values or conditions.
