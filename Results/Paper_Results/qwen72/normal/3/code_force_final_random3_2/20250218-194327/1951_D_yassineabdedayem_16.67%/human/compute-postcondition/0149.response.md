Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (which is at most 60).
- `tab` must have at least two elements.
- `i` is the third element of `tab`.

The `print` statement is:
```
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Understanding `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is defined as the third element of the list `tab`.
   - Since `tab` must have at least two elements, it is guaranteed to have a third element.

2. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Output: **[i] (where i is the third element of the list `tab`)**
