Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is 0 or a non-zero integer.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60 or less.
   - `tab` is a list containing at least 2 string representations of numbers.
   - `i` is the second element of `tab`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `i`.
   - According to the initial state, `i` is the second element of the list `tab`.
   - Since `tab` is a list containing at least 2 string representations of numbers, `i` will be the string representation of the second number in `tab`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the second element of `tab` followed by a space (because of `end=' '`).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[second element of tab] **

Where `[second element of tab]` is the string representation of the second number in the list `tab`.
