Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing two string representations, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, and `k` is updated to `k - Min` or `k - Max` based on the conditions. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`. Otherwise, `tab` contains the string representation of `Max` and `k` is updated to `k - Min`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is that `t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than or equal to `k`.
- The code `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`.
- If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`.
- Otherwise, `tab` contains the string representation of `Max` and `k` is updated to `k - Min`.
- The output state reflects these changes, with `tab` now containing two string representations and `k` updated based on the conditions.
