Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `rep` is 3, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, and `tab` now has an additional element which is the string representation of `number`. `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, so `rep` is now 3.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `k`, and `number` remain unchanged from the initial state.
