Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is updated to `0`. Otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k` is updated to `k - Min`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- The values of `t`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for updating `number` and `k` are still valid, but the specific values of `number` and `k` depend on the initial values of `n`, `Min`, and `Max`. Therefore, the conditions for updating `number` and `k` are included in the output state.
