Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input positive integer or 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 0. If `k` is 0, the loop has finished executing all elements in `tab`. If `k` is a positive integer, the loop has stopped because one of the conditions `n != 0`, `k > 0`, or `rep < 60` is no longer true.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer or 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, `number` is `Min` and `k` is `k - Max`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `rep` is 3, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, and `tab` now has an additional element which is the string representation of `number`. `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is set to `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
