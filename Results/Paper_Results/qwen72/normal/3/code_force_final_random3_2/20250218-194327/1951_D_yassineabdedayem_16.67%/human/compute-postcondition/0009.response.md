Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

The value of `number` is now set to `Min`, which is `min(n // k, k)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
