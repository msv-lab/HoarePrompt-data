Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing three string representations, `k` is updated to `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k - Min`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is set to `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is set to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- The values of `t`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for updating `k` and setting `number` remain the same as in the initial state.
- The values of `Min` and `Max` are still determined by the same expressions as in the initial state.
