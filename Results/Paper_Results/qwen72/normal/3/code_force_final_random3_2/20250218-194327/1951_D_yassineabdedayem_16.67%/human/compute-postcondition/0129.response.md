Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer or 0 and must be greater than `Min`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, `number` is `Min` and `k` is `k - Max`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.**

The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. The values and conditions for the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number`) remain the same as in the initial state.
