Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` after being updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer and `k` is now `k - Min`, `rep` is 1, `number` is `Max`, `tab` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `Max`, `Min` is equal to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is equal to `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - Min`, where `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` after being updated to `n - Min * Max` still holds, as `k` has been decreased by `Min`.
- The initial state information about `t`, `n`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remains valid.
