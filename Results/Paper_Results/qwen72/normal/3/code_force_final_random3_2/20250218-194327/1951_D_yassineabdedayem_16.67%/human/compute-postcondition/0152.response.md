The provided `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`. There are no variables or objects being referenced in the `print` statement itself. The initial state describes some variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `tab`), but these are not used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **NO**
