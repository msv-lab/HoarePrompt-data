Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user, `A` and `B` are undefined.**

Explanation: The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated based on user input. The values of `A` and `B` are no longer valid because they were calculated using the previous values of `a` and `b`, which have now been replaced. The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
