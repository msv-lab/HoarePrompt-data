Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user, `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.**

The value of `B` is now defined as `int(m / b) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged: `t` is still greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are still integers provided by the user, and `A` is still `int(m / a) + 1`.
