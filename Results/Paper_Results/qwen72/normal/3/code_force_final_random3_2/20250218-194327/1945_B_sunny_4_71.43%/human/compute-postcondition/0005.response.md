Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(A + B)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine the value of `A`**:
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - `int(m / a)` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, which gives the largest integer less than or equal to the result of `m / a`.
   - Adding 1 to this result gives `A`.

2. **Determine the value of `B`**:
   - `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.
   - `int(m / b)` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, which gives the largest integer less than or equal to the result of `m / b`.
   - Adding 1 to this result gives `B`.

3. **Calculate the sum `A + B`**:
   - The sum of `A` and `B` is simply the addition of the two values calculated in steps 1 and 2.

### Final Output:
The `print(A + B)` statement will print the sum of `A` and `B`, where:
- `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int(m / a) + 1 + int(m / b) + 1 (where A is int(m / a) + 1 and B is int(m / b) + 1)**
