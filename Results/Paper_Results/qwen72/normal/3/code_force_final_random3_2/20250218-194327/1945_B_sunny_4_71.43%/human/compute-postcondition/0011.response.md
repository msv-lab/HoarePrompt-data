The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any specific value, it does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user, `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`**
