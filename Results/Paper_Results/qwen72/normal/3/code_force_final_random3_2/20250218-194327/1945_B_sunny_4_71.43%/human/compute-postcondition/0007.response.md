Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user, `A` and `B` are undefined.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reassigns new values to `a`, `b`, and `m` based on user input. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are overwritten, and `A` and `B` are no longer valid because they were dependent on the old values of `a`, `b`, and `m`. The condition that `t` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
