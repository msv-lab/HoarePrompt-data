To determine what will be printed by the `print(A + B)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user.
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

2. **Calculations:**
   - `A` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, plus 1.
   - `B` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, plus 1.
   - The `print(A + B)` statement will print the sum of `A` and `B`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - `int(m / a)` performs integer division of `m` by `a`, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
   - Adding 1 to this result gives `A`.
   - Similarly, `int(m / b)` performs integer division of `m` by `b`, and adding 1 to this result gives `B`.
   - The sum `A + B` is the value that will be printed.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **A + B (where A is int(m / a) + 1 and B is int(m / b) + 1)**
