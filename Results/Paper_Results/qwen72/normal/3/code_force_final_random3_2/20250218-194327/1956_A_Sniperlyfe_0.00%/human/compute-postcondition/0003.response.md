Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`. The previous state of `p` being a list of `k` positive integers in strictly increasing order is no longer valid as `p` is now a list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, and `qs`) remain unchanged.
