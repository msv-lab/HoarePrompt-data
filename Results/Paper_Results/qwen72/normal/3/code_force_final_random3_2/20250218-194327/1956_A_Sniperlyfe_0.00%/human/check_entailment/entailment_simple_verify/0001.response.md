### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a sequence `a` of integers where players at positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` are removed from the game in each round.
   - The game continues until no more players can be removed.
   - We need to determine the number of winners for different initial numbers of players `n_i`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(n, p)`**
   - This function takes an integer `n` (the initial number of players) and a list `p` (the sequence of positions to remove).
   - It iterates while the number of players `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum position in `p`.
   - In each iteration, it reduces `n` by the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
   - Finally, it returns the number of players remaining, which is the number of winners.
   - **Annotation Validation:**
     - The state before the function call is correctly described: `n` is a non-negative integer and `p` is a sorted list of integers such that `1 <= p[i] <= 100`.
     - The state after the function call is also correct: `n` is a non-negative integer that is less than `min(p)`, and `p` remains unchanged.
     - The function correctly simulates the game rounds by reducing `n` by the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - It prints the results for each test case.
   - **Annotation Validation:**
     - The state before the function call is correctly described: `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 250`, `k` and `q` are positive integers such that `1 <= k, q <= 100`, `p` is a list of `k` positive integers in strictly increasing order such that `1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100`, and `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers such that `1 <= qs[i] <= 100` for all `0 <= i < q`.
     - The state after the function call is also correct: `t` is an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 250`, `k` and `q` are updated to their final input values, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers, and `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.
     - The loop processes all `t` sets of inputs correctly.

4. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The function `func_2()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It processes each test case by reading `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It correctly prints the results for each test case in the required format.

5. **Correctness of `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - The function correctly reduces the number of players `n` by the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` in each round.
   - This ensures that the game continues until no more players can be removed, which is the correct termination condition.

6. **Correctness of `func_2()`**:
   - The function correctly processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input and calls `func_1(n, p)` for each initial player count `n` in `qs`.
   - It prints the results for each test case in the correct format.
