Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` in the order they appear in `qs`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers between 1 and 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.
- The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `qs` to a list of integers provided by the user. The user inputs a string of integers separated by spaces, and `map(int, input().split())` converts this string into a list of integers.
- The length of `qs` is `q`, and each element in `qs` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `p`, `res`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `qs` is now a list of q positive integers provided by the user.
