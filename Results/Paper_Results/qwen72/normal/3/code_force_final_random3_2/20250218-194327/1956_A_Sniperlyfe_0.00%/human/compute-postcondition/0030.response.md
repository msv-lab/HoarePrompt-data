Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q and must have `q` elements, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 250.
- The values of `k` and `q` remain integers between 1 and 100.
- The list `p` remains unchanged and is still a list of integers provided by the user.
- The list `qs` must have exactly `q` elements, each being a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- The list `res` now contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.
- The variable `_` is incremented by `q` (the number of elements in `qs`), and it must still be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
