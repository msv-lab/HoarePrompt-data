To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 250\).
   - `k` and `q` are input integers such that \(1 \leq k, q \leq 100\).
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers such that \(1 \leq qs[i] \leq 100\) for all \(0 \leq i < q\).
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.
   - `n` is the third element of `qs`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `n` is the third element of the list `qs`. Since `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers, `n` will be one of these integers.
   - `func_1(n, p)` is called twice, and the results are stored in the list `res`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact behavior. However, we know that `func_1` takes two arguments: `n` (an integer) and `p` (a list of integers).
   - `res` contains two elements: the result of the first call to `func_1(n, p)` and the result of the second call to `func_1(n, p)`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `res` to a string and joins them with a space.
   - Since `func_1` is not defined, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`. However, we know that `res` will contain two values, each of which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a string containing two values separated by a space. These values are the results of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **[result1] [result2] (where result1 and result2 are the results of func_1(n, p), and n is the third element of the list qs)**
