Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `k` and `q` from user input, followed by a list `p` of `k` strictly increasing positive integers and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers. It then processes each element `n` in `qs` by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. After processing all elements in `qs`, it prints the results in `res` for that test case. This process repeats for all `t` test cases. The function does not return any value, but it prints the results of `func_1` for each element in `qs` for each test case. **
