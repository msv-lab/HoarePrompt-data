Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `k` and `q` are assigned integer values from the input, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, `n` is the second element of `qs`.**

Explanation:
- The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` adds the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`.
- Since `res` already contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` from the initial state, after executing this code, `res` will contain the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged.
- The value of `n` is still the second element of `qs`.
