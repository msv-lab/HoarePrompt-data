Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `k` and `q` are assigned the integer values from the input, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `qs`. The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged.
