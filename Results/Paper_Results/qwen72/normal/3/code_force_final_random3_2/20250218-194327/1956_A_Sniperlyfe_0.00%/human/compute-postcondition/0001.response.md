The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state before the loop starts already ensures that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, which means the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state does not need to be changed for the loop to execute. The loop will execute based on the given state.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of k positive integers in strictly increasing order such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q**
