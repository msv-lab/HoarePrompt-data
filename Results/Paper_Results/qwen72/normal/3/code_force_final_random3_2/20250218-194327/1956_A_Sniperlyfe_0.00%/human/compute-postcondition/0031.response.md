The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the input integer `t`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again. Given that `q` is the number of elements in `qs`, and `_` was incremented by `q` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by `q` again and still be less than `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q and must have `q` elements, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

To clarify the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `_` is incremented by `q` from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `t` remains the same as it is an input integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q and must have `q` elements, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

To simplify:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**
