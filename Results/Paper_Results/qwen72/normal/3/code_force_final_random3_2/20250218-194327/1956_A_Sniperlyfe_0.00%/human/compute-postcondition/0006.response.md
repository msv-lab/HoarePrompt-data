The only objects in the loop head are `n` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t`, `k`, `q`, and `p` are irrelevant to the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. The variable `n` is set to the first element of `qs` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, and `qs` has been updated to a list of integers from the user input, `res` is an empty list, `qs` must have at least 1 element, `n` is the first element of `qs`**
