Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are updated to their final input values such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, and the loop has executed `t` times, processing all `t` sets of inputs.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` remains the same as it was initially, but the variables `k` and `q` have been updated to their final values from the last iteration. The list `p` and `qs` are the final sets of integers provided by the user in the last iteration, and `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` from the last iteration. The loop has processed all `t` sets of inputs, and the program has printed the results for each set.
