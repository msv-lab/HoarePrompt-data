The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string it is given to print.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`.
2. However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables.
3. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Thus, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **YES**
