Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, and `s` is the new input string. If `s` == '00', the program retains the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`. Otherwise, the program also retains the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s`.**
