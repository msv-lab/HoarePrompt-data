Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the new input string. If `s` == '00', the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part, but since both parts result in the same state, the overall postcondition remains unchanged.***
