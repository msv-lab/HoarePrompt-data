Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer not equal to 2, `s` is an input string, and `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s` and is even. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1, or `count_1` is not equal to 2.***
