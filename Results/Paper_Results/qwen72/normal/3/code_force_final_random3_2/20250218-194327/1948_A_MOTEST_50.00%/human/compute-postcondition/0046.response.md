Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `ans` is the string `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2`, `x` is 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending `s[x] * 2` to the existing value of `ans`.
- Since `x` is 1, `s[x]` refers to the second character in the string `s`.
- The initial value of `ans` is `s[0] * 2`, which means the first character of `s` repeated twice.
- After executing the code, `ans` becomes `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2`, which means the first character of `s` repeated twice, followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
