Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should be called with a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The console screen is cleared. `s` is the string containing all uppercase ASCII letters ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'). `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans = ''
        x = 0
        if n % 2 == 0:
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        else:
            ans, x = 'AAA', 1
            for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to `x`, `j`, or `ans`. If `n` is not 1, `x` is set to `n // 2`, `j` is set to `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, and `j` is set to `n // 2 - 2` if `n` is odd. If `n` is even, `ans` is a string containing each character of `s` from index 0 to `n // 2 - 1` repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` is 'AAA' + each character of `s` from index 1 to `n // 2 - 1` repeated twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` == 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is even, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `ans` is the string `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2 + ... + s[(n // 2) - 1] * 2`. If `n` is odd, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, and `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2 + ... + s[n//2 - 1] * 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the state remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating each of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and at least 5, `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2 + `s[2]` * 2 + ... + `s[n // 2 - 1]` * 2, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
