The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n // 2`. For the loop to execute, `n // 2` must be greater than 0. Given that `n` is even and not equal to 1, the smallest possible value for `n` is 2. If `n` is 2, then `n // 2` is 1, which means the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 and `j` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is an empty string, `x` is 0, `j` is 0**
