### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by clearing the console using `os.system('cls')`. This is not necessary for the problem and can be omitted, but it does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - It then reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and processes it.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The program checks if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have a string with exactly one special character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because a special character must have at least one neighbor, and if there is only one special character, it cannot be equal to both neighbors.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is not 1, the program constructs a string `ans`:
     - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating each letter from `string.ascii_uppercase` twice until the length of the string is `n`. This ensures that each character in the pair is a special character.
     - If `n` is odd, it starts with the string "AAA" (which has 3 special characters) and then continues to repeat each letter from `string.ascii_uppercase` twice until the length of the string is `n`. This ensures that the initial "AAA" contributes 3 special characters, and the remaining pairs contribute 2 special characters each, resulting in a total of `n` special characters.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Even `n`**:
  - For even `n`, the program correctly constructs a string where each pair of consecutive characters is the same, ensuring that each character in the pair is a special character.
  - The length of the string is exactly `n`, and each character is special because it is equal to one of its neighbors.

- **Odd `n`**:
  - For odd `n`, the program starts with "AAA" (which has 3 special characters) and then continues to add pairs of characters.
  - The total number of special characters in the string will be `n` because the initial "AAA" contributes 3 special characters, and the remaining pairs contribute 2 special characters each.
  - The length of the string will be `n + 1` (since "AAA" is 3 characters and each pair is 2 characters), but this is within the allowed length of 200.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 by printing "NO".
  - It also handles the case where `n` is 2 by constructing "MM" (which has 2 special characters).

### Annotated Code Verification:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The initial state before the function call is accurately described.
- The state after the loop is also correctly described, noting the changes in `ans`, `x`, and `j` based on the value of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given requirements and edge cases. It constructs a valid string for even and odd `n` and prints "NO" for `n = 1`.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
