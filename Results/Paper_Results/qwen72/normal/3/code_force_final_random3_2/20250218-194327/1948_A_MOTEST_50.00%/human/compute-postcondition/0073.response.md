The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n // 2` is greater than 0. This means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to run at least once. The variable `j` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `ans` is an empty string, `x` is 0, `j` is 0**
