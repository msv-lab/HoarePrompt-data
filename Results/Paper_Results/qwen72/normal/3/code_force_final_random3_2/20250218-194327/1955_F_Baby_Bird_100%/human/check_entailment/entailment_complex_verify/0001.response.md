### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( a \oplus b = b \oplus a \) and \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Winning Condition Analysis:**
   - For Bob to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be zero.
   - For Alice to win, the XOR of the remaining numbers must be non-zero.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - The key is to balance the counts of the numbers to achieve this.

5. **Count Analysis:**
   - Let \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) be the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   - The XOR of the sequence can be simplified by considering the parity of the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - Specifically, the XOR of the sequence is zero if and only if the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all even or all odd.

6. **Program Logic:**
   - The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by summing the results of the expression \( 3 * (x // 2) + x \% 2 * (i < 3) \) for each count \( p_i \).
   - The expression \( 3 * (x // 2) \) counts the number of pairs of the same number that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - The expression \( x \% 2 * (i < 3) \) adds an extra 1 if there is an odd count of 1, 2, or 3, which helps in balancing the sequence to achieve a zero XOR.
   - The sum is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

7. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic of the program aligns with the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then reads the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 for each test case.
  - This is correctly implemented using `int(input())` and `map(int, input().split())`.

- **Expression Analysis:**
  - The expression \( 3 * (x // 2) \) correctly counts the number of pairs of the same number that can be removed.
  - The expression \( x \% 2 * (i < 3) \) correctly adds an extra 1 if there is an odd count of 1, 2, or 3, which helps in balancing the sequence to achieve a zero XOR.
  - The sum of these values is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

- **Test Case Validation:**
  - For the given example:
    - Test case 1: \( (1, 1, 1, 0) \)
      - \( 3 * (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 * (0 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
      - \( 3 * (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 * (1 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
      - \( 3 * (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 * (2 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
      - \( 3 * (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 * (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
      - Sum: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3 \)
      - Result: \( 3 // 3 = 1 \)
    - Test case 2: \( (1, 0, 1, 2) \)
      - \( 3 * (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 * (0 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
      - \( 3 * (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 * (1 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
      - \( 3 * (1 // 2) + 1 \% 2 * (2 < 3) = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
      - \( 3 * (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 * (3 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
      - Sum: \( 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 5 \)
      - Result: \( 5 // 3 = 1 \)
    - Test case 3: \( (2, 2, 2, 0) \)
      - \( 3 * (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
      - \( 3 * (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
      - \( 3 * (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
      - \( 3 * (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 * (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
      - Sum: \( 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 9 \)
      - Result: \( 9 // 3 = 3 \)
    - Test case 4: \( (3, 3, 2, 0) \)
      - \( 3 * (3 // 2) + 3 \% 2 * (0 < 3) = 3 + 1 = 4 \)
      - \( 3 * (3 // 2) + 3 \% 2 * (1 < 3) = 3 + 1 = 4 \)
      - \( 3 * (2 // 2) + 2 \% 2 * (2 < 3) = 3 + 0 = 3 \)
      - \( 3 * (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 * (3 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
      - Sum: \( 4 + 4 + 3 + 0 = 11 \)
      - Result: \( 11 // 3 = 3 \)
    - Test case 5: \( (0, 9, 9, 9) \)
      - \( 3 * (0 // 2) + 0 \% 2 * (0 < 3) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
      - \( 3 * (9 // 2) + 9 \% 2 * (1 < 3) = 12 + 1 = 13 \)
      - \( 3 * (9 // 2) + 9 \% 2 * (2 < 3) = 12 + 1 = 13 \)
      - \( 3 * (9 // 2) + 9 \% 2 * (3 < 3) = 12 + 0 = 12 \)
      - Sum: \( 0 + 13 + 13 + 12 = 38 \)
      - Result: \( 38 // 3 = 12 \)

### Conclusion:
The program's logic and implementation are correct. The expression used to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win is valid and aligns with the optimal strategy for Eve to remove numbers.
