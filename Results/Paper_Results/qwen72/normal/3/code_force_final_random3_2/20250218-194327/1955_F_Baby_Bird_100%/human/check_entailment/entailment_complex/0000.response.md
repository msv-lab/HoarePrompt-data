### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( a \oplus b = b \oplus a \) and \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero as often as possible.
   - The key is to understand how the XOR of the sequence changes with the removal of numbers.

4. **XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4**:
   - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
   - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)

5. **Transformation Calculation**:
   - The function uses a transformation: \( 3 \times (x // 2) + x \% 2 \times (i < 3) \) for each \( p_i \).
   - This transformation is designed to count the number of pairs of each number and add a potential single number if it's one of the first three types (1, 2, 3).

6. **Sum and Integer Division**:
   - The sum of these transformed values is then divided by 3 to get the result.
   - This division by 3 is crucial because it effectively counts the number of times Bob can win by ensuring the XOR of the sequence is zero.

7. **Verification**:
   - For each test case, the function reads four integers and applies the transformation.
   - The transformation and sum calculation are consistent with the problem's requirements to maximize Bob's wins.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The transformation and sum calculation are aligned with the bitwise XOR properties and the problem's constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
