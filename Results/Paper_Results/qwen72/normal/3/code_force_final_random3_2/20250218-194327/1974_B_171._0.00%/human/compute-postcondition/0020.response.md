Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` is a list containing the character 'a', `c` is 97, and `mapping` is a dictionary with the key 'a' mapped to `char`.** 

The code appends the character 'a' to the `decoded` list, which was initially empty. The other variables (`encoded`, `c`, and `mapping`) remain unchanged.
