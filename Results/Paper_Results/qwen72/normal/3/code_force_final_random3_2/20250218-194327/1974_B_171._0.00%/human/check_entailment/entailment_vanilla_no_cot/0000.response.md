Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. The issue lies in the way the `mapping` dictionary is populated and used. According to the problem, the decoding process should reverse the encoding process, where each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric character from the auxiliary string `r` (which is the sorted set of unique characters in the original string `s`).

However, the program incorrectly maps each character in the encoded string to a character that is not yet in the `mapping` values, which does not follow the symmetric replacement rule. Instead, the program should:

1. Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b` by sorting the unique characters.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    
    # Step 2: Create the symmetric mapping
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

This corrected version correctly follows the steps of the decoding algorithm and should produce the expected output for the given test cases.
