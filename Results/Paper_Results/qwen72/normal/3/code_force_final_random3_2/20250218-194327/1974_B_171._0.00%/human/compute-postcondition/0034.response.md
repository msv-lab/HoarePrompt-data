Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping`. `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `c` is 99. If `chr(c)` (which is 'c') is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` now includes the key 'c' mapped to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The initial state remains mostly unchanged, but if the character 'c' (which corresponds to the ASCII value 99) is not already in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, then the `mapping` dictionary is updated to include the key 'c' mapped to the current `char` from `encoded`. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If 'c' is already in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping` remains unchanged.
