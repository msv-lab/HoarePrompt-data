Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, and the character `char` is not in the `mapping` dictionary
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `mapping` is a dictionary. If the character 'a' is not present in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, then `mapping` has the key 'a' mapped to `char`, and `char` is not in the `mapping` dictionary except for the key 'a'. `decoded` remains an empty list, and `c` is 97. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` remains an empty list, and `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` (which is 'b') is not in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, then `mapping` has the key 'a' mapped to `char` and the key 'b' mapped to `char`, and `char` is not in the `mapping` dictionary except for the keys 'a' and 'b'. In this case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` remains an empty list, `c` is 99, `mapping` remains unchanged. If `chr(c)` (which is 'c') is not in `mapping.values()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
