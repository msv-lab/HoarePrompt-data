Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the logic used to create the `mapping` dictionary and how it is used to decode the string. According to the problem description, the decoding process should reverse the encoding process, where each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.

However, the function `func_1` in the program does not follow this logic. Instead, it creates a mapping from each unique character in the encoded string to a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a' and going up to 'z'. This is fundamentally different from the required symmetric mapping.

For example, if the encoded string is "serofedsoc", the correct decoding should involve creating the string `r` as "cdefors" and then mapping each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in `r`. The program, however, would map 's' to 'a', 'e' to 'b', 'r' to 'c', and so on, which does not match the required decoding process.

To correctly decode the string, the program should:
1. Construct the string `r` from the distinct characters of the original string in alphabetical order.
2. Create a mapping where the first character of `r` maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

The current implementation does not achieve this, and thus the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
