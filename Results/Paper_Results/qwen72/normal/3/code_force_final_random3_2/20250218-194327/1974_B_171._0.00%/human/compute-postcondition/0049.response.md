Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least two characters, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'z' if `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 98, `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `mapping` now includes the key 'b' mapped to `char`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet `break` only affects the control flow by breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `encoded`, `decoded`, `c`, `char`, and `mapping` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
