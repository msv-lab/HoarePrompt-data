    #State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a' and going up to 'z', and `decoded` is a list containing the corresponding lowercase Latin letters for each character in `encoded` based on the `mapping`.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that is the decoded version of the `encoded` string, where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding lowercase Latin letter from the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. Each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a' and going up to 'z'. The returned string is the result of replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding mapped letter.
