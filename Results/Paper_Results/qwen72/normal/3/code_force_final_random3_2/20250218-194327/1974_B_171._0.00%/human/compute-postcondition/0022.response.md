The only object in the loop head is the variable `char` and the string `encoded`. The loop iterates over each character in the `encoded` string. At the end of the last iteration, `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, and `char` is the last character processed in the `encoded` string.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character in the `encoded` string after the current `char`. Since the loop increments the position of `char` to the next character in `encoded` at each iteration, for the next iteration, `char` will be the next character in the string, and `encoded` must still have at least one character remaining.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `decoded` is a list containing either the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or the character 'a' if `char` is not in `mapping`. If `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 97 and `mapping` is updated to include the key 'a' mapped to `char`. `char` is the next character in `encoded`.**
