You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)

Each test case consists of an integer n where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.

    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of \(x // 4\) for all values \(x\) in `cnt.values()`, and `cnt` is a dictionary with each key being an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key being the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it only counts the number of groups of sticks that can form squares (4-sided polygons). However, the problem description requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons (which can have any number of sides, not just 4) that can be formed. For example, if the input is:

```
1
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```

The program will output `1` because it only counts the square formed by the four sticks of length 3. However, the correct output should be `1` because a regular hexagon can also be formed using the six sticks of length 3. The program fails to consider polygons with more than 4 sides, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
