Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100 and `n` must be at least 3, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the first element of `a` as a key and its value is 1, the second element of `a` (which is `x`) as a key with its value incremented by 1, and the third element of `a` (which is also `x`) as a key with its value incremented by 2, `x` is the third element in `a`.**
