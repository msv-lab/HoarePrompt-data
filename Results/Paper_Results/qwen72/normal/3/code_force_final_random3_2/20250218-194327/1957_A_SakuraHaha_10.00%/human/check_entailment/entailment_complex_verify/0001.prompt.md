You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for all values `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` is a dictionary with each key being an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key being the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of \(x // 4\) for all values \(x\) in `cnt.values()`, and `cnt` is a dictionary with each key being an integer from the list `a` and the value for each key being the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from user input. It then calculates the number of groups of four sticks that can be formed from each unique stick length in the list `a` and prints this number. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result of the calculation for the current test case. The function is designed to be called multiple times, once for each test case, but the handling of multiple test cases is not shown in the provided code.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - This is done by iterating over the list of stick lengths and updating the dictionary.

3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt` to determine how many regular polygons can be formed.
   - It uses the formula `x // 4` to calculate the number of polygons that can be formed with sticks of length `x`. This is because a regular polygon with 4 sides (a square) is the smallest regular polygon that can be formed.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic:
- The program assumes that all polygons are squares (4-sided polygons). This is incorrect because the problem statement allows for any regular polygon (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the possibility of forming polygons with any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. The correct approach would be to find the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of each stick length by the smallest possible number of sides (3) and then summing these values.

Given the current implementation, the program will not produce the correct output for test cases where polygons with more than 4 sides can be formed.

Correctness: **False**
