Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. n is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks in the current test case. Each test case consists of a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.**
