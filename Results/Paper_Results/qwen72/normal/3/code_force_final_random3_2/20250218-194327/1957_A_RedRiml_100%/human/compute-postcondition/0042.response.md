Output State: **`shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer.**

The value of `ln` is assigned the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`shapes`, `_`, and `w`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
