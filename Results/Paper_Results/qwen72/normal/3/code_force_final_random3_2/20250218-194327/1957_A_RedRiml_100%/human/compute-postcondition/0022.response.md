Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that may contain the first and second elements of `palka`. The dictionary `d` now includes the key `i` with the value 1, regardless of whether `i` was already in `pl` or not.**
