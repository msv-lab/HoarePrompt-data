Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers input by the user; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary that includes the key `i` with the value 1 if `i` was not already a key in `d`, or the value associated with `i` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already a key in `d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` now also contains the second element of `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary that includes the key `i` with the value 1 if `i` was not already a key in `d`, or the value associated with `i` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already a key in `d`. If `i` is in `pl`, the state of `pl` and `d` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that may contain the first and second elements of `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, the third element `i` from `palka` is appended to the list `pl`. If `d.get(i) == None`, the dictionary `d` now includes the key `i` with the value 1. If `d.get(i) != None` and `i` is in `pl`, `pl` and `d` remain unchanged. If `d.get(i) != None` and `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` now contains the third element of `palka`, and the value associated with `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
