Postcondition: ***`shapes` is 0 if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is `d[j] // 3`. `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka`, `w` is greater than the current value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element of `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.***
