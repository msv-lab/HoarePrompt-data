Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` is greater than the new value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is an empty list, and `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` is greater than the new value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is a list containing the first integer from `palka` if `i` was not already in `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now contains the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, `d` contains the key `i` with its value incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` is greater than the new value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is a list containing the first integer from `palka` if `i` was not already in `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now contains the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now contains `i` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` is greater than the new value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is a list containing the first and second integers from `palka` if they were not already in `pl`. If `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now contains `i` as its last element, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now contains the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
