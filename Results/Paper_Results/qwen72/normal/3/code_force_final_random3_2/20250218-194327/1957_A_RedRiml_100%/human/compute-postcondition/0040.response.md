To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `shapes` is defined as the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `d` is a dictionary or list where each key or index `j` in `pl` maps to an integer value.
   - `pl` is a list of indices or keys that are used to access elements in `d`.

2. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - For each element `j` in the list `pl`, the value `d[j]` is checked.
   - If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, the integer division `d[j] // 3` is performed.
   - The results of these integer divisions are summed up to form the value of `shapes`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(shapes)` statement will print the sum of the integer divisions `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - Since the exact values of `d` and `pl` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, we can describe the value based on the given conditions.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3)**
