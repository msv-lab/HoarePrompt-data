Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `if n == 1:` is incorrect because the problem description states that `n` is always even and `2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5`. Therefore, `n` can never be 1, and this condition will never be true. Additionally, the logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the robot can only reach (2, n) if certain conditions are met, but it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
>><<
>>><
```
The correct output should be `YES` because the robot can follow the path: (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (2, 4). However, the program will output `NO` because it incorrectly checks the arrows in the second row and the first row in a way that does not simulate the robot's movement accurately.

To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), the program should simulate the robot's movement step by step, considering both the initial move and the subsequent move along the arrow in the current cell.
