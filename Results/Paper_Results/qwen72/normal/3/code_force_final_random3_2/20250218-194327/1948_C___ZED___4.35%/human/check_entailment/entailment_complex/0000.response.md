### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The function first checks if the second-to-last character in the second row `b` is not '>'. If it is not, the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) because it would not be able to move to the last column in the second row. In this case, it prints 'NO'.
   - If `n` is 1, the function prints 'YES'. However, this condition is never met because the problem states that `n` is always even and greater than or equal to 2.

3. **Path Checking:**
   - The function then checks if there is a path by setting a flag `no_path` to `True`.
   - It iterates over the even indices of `b` (from 0 to `n-1` with a step of 2) and checks if any of these characters is not '>'. If any character is not '>', it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after the first loop, it iterates over the odd indices of `a` (from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2) and checks if any of these characters is not '>'. If any character is not '>', it sets `no_path` to `False`.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both loops, it prints 'YES', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition for `n == 1`:**
   - The condition `if n == 1:` is never true because `n` is always even and at least 2. This part of the code is redundant and can be removed.

2. **Incorrect Path Checking Logic:**
   - The logic for checking the path is flawed. The function checks if all even indices in `b` and all odd indices in `a` are '>', but this does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
   - The robot can move in multiple ways, and the current logic does not account for all possible paths. For example, the robot can move from the first row to the second row and back multiple times, and the current logic does not consider this.

### Correct Logic:

To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), we need to ensure that:
- The robot can move from (1, 1) to (2, n) without getting stuck.
- The robot can move along the arrows in such a way that it can eventually reach (2, n).

A correct approach would be to:
- Check if the robot can move from (1, 1) to the second row.
- From the second row, check if the robot can move to the last column (2, n).

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the path checking logic, the function is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
