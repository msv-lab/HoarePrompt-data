Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `k` is the last even index less than `n`. If `no_path` is False, `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd.
   - `no_path` is False if any character at an odd index from 1 to `n-2` (if `n` is even) or `n-1` (if `n` is odd) in `a` is not `>`.

2. **Given `no_path` is False:**
   - This implies that the condition for `no_path` to remain False is met, i.e., any character at an odd index from 1 to `n-2` (if `n` is even) or `n-1` (if `n` is odd) in `a` is `>`.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

4. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
   - The value of `no_path` is False, but this does not affect the `print` statement directly because the `print` statement is not conditional on `no_path`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `'NO'` regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `k`.

Output: **NO**
