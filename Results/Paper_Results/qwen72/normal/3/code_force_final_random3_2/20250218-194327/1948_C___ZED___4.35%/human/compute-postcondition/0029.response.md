The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `k` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `n` is greater than 2. Since the loop increments `k` by 2, the next value of `k` will be 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4 (because `k` must be less than `n - 1`).

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being '>', `k` is 3. If the character at index `k` in `a` is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**
