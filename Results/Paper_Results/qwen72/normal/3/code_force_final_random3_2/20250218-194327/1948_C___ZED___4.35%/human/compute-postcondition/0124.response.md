Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `k` is the last even number less than `n`.
   - `no_path` is True.
   - Any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is '>', where `k` is the last even number less than `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables and their values, but it does not affect the `print` statement in this case.
   - The value of `no_path` is True, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
   - The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` are also not used in the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
