### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The function checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`>`). If it is not, the robot cannot reach the last cell in the second row, and the function prints 'NO'.
   - This check is valid because if the second-to-last cell in the second row does not point to the right, the robot cannot move from the second-to-last cell to the last cell in the second row, which is necessary for reaching the target cell (2, n).

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The function checks if `n` is 1. If it is, the function prints 'YES'.
   - This check is indeed incorrect because the problem description states that `n` is always even and `2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5`. Therefore, `n` can never be 1, and this condition will never be true. This part of the code is redundant and can be removed.

4. **Path Checking:**
   - The function initializes a variable `no_path` to `True` and iterates over the cells in the second row with even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., n-2) to check if any of them are not pointing to the right (`>`). If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it iterates over the cells in the first row with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., n-3) to check if any of them are not pointing to the right (`>`). If any are not, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both checks, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The function's logic for checking the path is flawed. It assumes that the robot can only move to the right in the second row and to the right in the first row. However, the robot can also move up and down between rows, and the arrows in the cells can change the direction of the robot's movement.
   - The function does not account for the robot's ability to move up and down between rows, which is crucial for determining if the robot can reach the target cell.
   - The function's current logic is overly restrictive and does not consider all possible paths the robot can take.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the robot's ability to move up and down between rows, and it contains an unnecessary and incorrect special case for `n == 1`.

### Correctness:
**False**
