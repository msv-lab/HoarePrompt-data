Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}), `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9), `F` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9) and must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists), `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - F[0]`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - F[0]) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}), `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9) and must have at least two elements, `F` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9) and must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists), `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[0]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[0]`. If `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)` is true, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` remains `bisect_left(D, right - F[0]) - 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid` and `l` remains the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - F[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}), `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9) and must have at least two elements, `F` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9) and must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists), `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[0]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[0]`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is adjusted such that `l < h` is still true. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid` and `l` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}), `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9) and must have at least two elements, `F` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9) and must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists), `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[0]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[0]`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is adjusted such that `l < h` is still true. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid` and `l` remains the same.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
