Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `f` is the first element in `F`, `l` is the index in `D` where the value is greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index just before the first element in `D` that is greater than or equal to `right - f`.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, but `h` is now one index greater than `l`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is one index greater than `l`. Otherwise, `l` and `h` remain converged to the same index in `D`. `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `f`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. The difference `mid_sum - left` is less than the difference `right - mid_next_sum` if the if condition is true, and greater than or equal to the difference `right - mid_next_sum` if the else condition is true.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is equal to `l`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is one index greater than `l`. Otherwise, `l` and `h` remain converged to the same index in `D`, but `h` is one index greater than `l`. `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f` remain unchanged. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `h` is one index greater than `l`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
