Functionality: ** The function `func_6` processes a set of input variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F`. It identifies the largest and second largest differences between consecutive elements in the list `A`. It then calculates the minimum possible maximum difference between two elements in `A` by adjusting them using the elements in `F` and the closest elements in `D`. Finally, it prints the maximum of this minimum value and the second largest difference found in `A`. The function does not return any value. **
