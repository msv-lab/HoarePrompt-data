Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`, `h` is equal to `l` (if `l` and `h` were previously the same index and `left - f` is less than or equal to the element at that index, `l` will still be equal to `h`), `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `l` is updated to the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`.
- Since `l` and `h` were initially the same index, and `l` is updated based on `left - f`, `h` will still be equal to `l` if `left - f` is less than or equal to the element at that index.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged.
