Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` and `l` must be less than `h`, `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the values `D[mid] + f` to `mid_sum` and `D[mid + 1] + f` to `mid_next_sum`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, where `l` and `h` are indices in the list `D`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged.
