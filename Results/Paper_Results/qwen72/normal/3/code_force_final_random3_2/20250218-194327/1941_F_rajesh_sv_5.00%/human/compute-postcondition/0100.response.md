Output State: **`l` is now `mid + 1`, `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- The value of `h` remains the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`.
- The variables `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
- The value of `mid` is still calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, but `l` has been updated.
- The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are still based on the updated `mid` and `f`, so they remain `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively.
