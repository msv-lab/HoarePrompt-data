Output State: **`l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `f` is the first element in `F`, `l` is the index in `D` where the value is greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index just before the first element in `D` that is greater than or equal to `right - f`.**

Explanation:
- `h` is updated using `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, which finds the index just before the first element in `D` that is greater than or equal to `right - f`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
