Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, A is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}), D is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9), F is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9), `max_diff` is -infinity, `next_max_diff` is -infinity, `index` is None, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, `max_diff` is set to `A[1] - A[0]` and `index` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is set to `A[1] - A[0]`.***
