Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` and `l` must be less than `h`, `h` is now equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated to be equal to `mid`, which was previously defined as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
