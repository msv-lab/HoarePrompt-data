Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}), `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models (1 <= d_i <= 10^9) and must have at least two elements, `F` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()` representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9) and must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists), `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - F[0]) - 1` and `h` must be greater than `l`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[0]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[0]`, and the condition `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)` is true.**
