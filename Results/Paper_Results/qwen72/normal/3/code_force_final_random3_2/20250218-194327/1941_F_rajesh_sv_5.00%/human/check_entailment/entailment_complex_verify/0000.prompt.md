You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

#Function 1:

    #The program returns a function named `wrapper`, which is a callable function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a callable function `func` and returns a new callable function named `wrapper`. The function `func_1` does not modify the input `func` or any other external state; it simply creates and returns the `wrapper` function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of arguments that can be passed to the function `func`, and `d` is a dictionary used for memoization.
def wrapper():

If `args` is not in `d`, `d[args]` is set to the result of `func(*args)`, and `args` is now a key in `d`. If `args` is already in `d`, the state of `d` remains unchanged.

    #The program returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`. If `args` was not initially in `d`, the value returned is the result of `func(*args)`, and `args` is now a key in `d`. If `args` was already in `d`, the value returned is the previously stored result of `func(*args)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The `wrapper` function does not explicitly accept parameters but uses a tuple `args` and a dictionary `d` that are assumed to be defined in the outer scope. It checks if `args` is a key in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not in `d`, it computes the result of `func(*args)`, stores this result in `d` with `args` as the key, and returns the result. If `args` is already in `d`, it simply returns the value associated with `args` in `d`. In both cases, the function ensures that `d` contains the result of `func(*args)` for the given `args`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `delimiter` (a string, defaulting to a single space ' '). It returns a list of integers by splitting the string returned from `func_2()` using the specified `delimiter` and converting each part to an integer.

    #This is printed: max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum value of the maximum differences calculated for each f in F, and next_max_diff is an unchanged value)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` processes a set of input variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F`. It identifies the largest and second largest differences between consecutive elements in the list `A`. It then calculates the minimum possible maximum difference between two elements in `A` by adjusting them using the elements in `F` and the closest elements in `D`. Finally, it prints the maximum of this minimum value and the second largest difference found in `A`. The function does not return any value.

    #State: `testcases` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `func_6()` has been called `testcases` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a number of test cases by calling `func_3()`, and then calls `func_6()` that many times. After the function concludes, `testcases` is a non-negative integer, and `func_6()` has been called `testcases` times. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical issue in the way it handles the binary search for the best position to insert the new problem complexity. Specifically, the use of `bisect_right` and `bisect_left` in the `func_6` function does not correctly handle all edge cases. For example, if the new complexity `D[mid] + f` is exactly equal to one of the existing complexities `left` or `right`, the program might not update `ans` correctly.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 1
1 10 100
50
50
```
In this case, the maximum difference is 90 (between 10 and 100). The program should be able to insert a new problem with complexity 100 (50 + 50), which would reduce the maximum difference to 50. However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the binary search logic, leading to an incorrect result.
