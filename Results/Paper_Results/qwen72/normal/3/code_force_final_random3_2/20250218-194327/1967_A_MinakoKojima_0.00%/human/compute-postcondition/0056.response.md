The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the range for the loop. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `_` being less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again. Given that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `_` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**
