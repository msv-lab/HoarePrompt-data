Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last index of the array `a` that the loop processes. The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop. The variable `ans` will be the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the array `a`, starting from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`. This means that `ans` will be updated by multiplying the initial value of `ans` (which is `a[0]`) by the differences `(a[1] - a[0])`, `(a[2] - a[1])`, `(a[3] - a[2])`, and so on, up to `(a[n-1] - a[n-2])`.
