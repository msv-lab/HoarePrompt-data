The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. This variable is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is within the range of the integer provided by the user input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (this is the number of iterations the loop will run).
- `_` is the loop counter, which is incremented by the `range` function.

At the start of the next iteration, `_` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, and `ans` is 0. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

This ensures that the loop will execute one more time if `_` is still less than `t`.
