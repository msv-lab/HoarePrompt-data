Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is equal to the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `i` is set to `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, and `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`.***
