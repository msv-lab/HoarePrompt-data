Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - n * m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`.
- `k` is calculated as `k - n * m`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a` (except for `a[0]`), `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
