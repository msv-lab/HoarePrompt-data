The value of `ans` is updated by multiplying its current value with the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]` simplifies to `a[1] - a[0]`. The initial value of `ans` is not specified, so we assume it could be any value. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is now `ans * (a[1] - a[0])`**
