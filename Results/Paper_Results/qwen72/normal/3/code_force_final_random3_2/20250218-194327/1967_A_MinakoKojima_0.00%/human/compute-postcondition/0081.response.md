Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `ans` is 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `a[i]` for all `i` in range `n` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for each iteration, and `ans` is the product of `a[0]` and the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`.**
