Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `m`.**

The value of `ans` is updated to the factorial of `n`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
