Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h1` is an empty string, `time` is an empty string, `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))` updates the values of `h` and `m` based on the user input.
- The input is expected to be in the format "hh:mm", so `h` will be the hour part and `m` will be the minute part of the input string.
- The values of `t`, `s`, `m1`, `h1`, and `time` are not directly affected by this code, but the conditions for `h1` and `time` based on the value of `h` are still valid.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1.
- Since the initial state specified that `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string if `h` is '01', and the code does not change this, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.
