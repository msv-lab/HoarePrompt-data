Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h1` is an empty string, `time` is an empty string, `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- `h1` is assigned an empty string, so `h1` is now an empty string.
- `m1` is assigned the value of `m`, so `m1` remains equal to `m`.
- The values of `t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, and `time` are not changed.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1.
