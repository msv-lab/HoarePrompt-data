Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
- `h` is the hour part of the input string `s`.
- `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`.
- `m1` is equal to `m`.
- The conditions for `h1` and `time` are as follows:
  - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '00', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is 'PM'.
  - If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '01', `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `h1` and `time` based on the value of `h`:**
   - If `h` is '01', `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string.
   - If `h` is '00', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'.

2. **Evaluate the print statement:**
   - The `print` statement concatenates `h1`, `':', m, ' ', time` with no separators (`sep=''`).

3. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If `h` is '01', `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string:
     - Output: **:m**
   - If `h` is '00', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM':
     - Output: **h:m AM**
   - If `h` is '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'PM':
     - Output: **h:m PM**
   - If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM':
     - Output: **02:m AM**

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the conditions provided, the output of the print statement will be:
- If `h` is '01': **:m**
- If `h` is '00', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11': **h:m AM**
- If `h` is '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23': **h:m PM**
- If `h` is '02': **02:m AM**

Since the exact value of `h` is not specified, we need to consider all possible cases. However, if we assume the most common case where `h` is not '01', the output will be:

Output: **h:m [time] (where h is the hour part of the input string, m is the minute part of the input string, and time is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions provided)**

If `h` is '01', the output will be:

Output: **:m (where m is the minute part of the input string)**
