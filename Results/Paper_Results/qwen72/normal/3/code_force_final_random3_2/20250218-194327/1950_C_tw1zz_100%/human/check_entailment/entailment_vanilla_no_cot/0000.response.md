Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly converts the given 24-hour format time to the 12-hour format time and prints it with the appropriate AM or PM suffix. The program handles all edge cases, including the transition from 12:00 AM to 12:00 PM and the conversion of hours from 13 to 23 to their 12-hour format equivalents. The program also maintains leading zeros for minutes and hours as required.

However, the program can be simplified using a more concise approach, but the current implementation is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
