Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
    h1, m1 = '', m
    time = ''
    if h == '01':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '02':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '03':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '04':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '05':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '06':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '07':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '08':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '09':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '10':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '11':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '12':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '13':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '14':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '15':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '16':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '17':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '18':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '19':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '20':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '21':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '22':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '23':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '00':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'AM'
    print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`. If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '00', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '01', `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `_` is incremented by 1. If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '04' to '11', `h1` is the corresponding hour and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is '01', `h1` is set to '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02' to '11', `h1` is set to the corresponding hour and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (from '01' to '11') and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
