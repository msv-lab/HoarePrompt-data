The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's execution depends on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variables `t` and `s` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
