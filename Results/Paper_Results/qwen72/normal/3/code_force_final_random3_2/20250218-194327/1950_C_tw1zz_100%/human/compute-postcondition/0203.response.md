Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h1` is an empty string, `_` is incremented by 1, `time` remains as determined based on the value of `h`**

Explanation:
- `h1` is assigned an empty string (`''`).
- `m1` is assigned the value of `m`, which is the minute part of the input string `s`.
- The other variables (`t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, `_`, `time`) remain unchanged.
