Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If `b` is not divisible by 3, `c` is less than 3, and the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k` + `a` + (`b` + `c`) // 3, and if the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, `k` is further increased by 1.***
