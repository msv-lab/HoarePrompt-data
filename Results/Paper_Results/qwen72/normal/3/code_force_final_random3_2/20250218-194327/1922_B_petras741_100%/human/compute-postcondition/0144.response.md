Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers input by the user. If `n` is less than 3, no additional changes are made. If `n` is at least 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in the range of `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`. `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `j` is set to `n` and `rho` is the count of how many times `eta[0]` appears in `w`. If `eta_ln` is not 1, `j` is set to `eta_ln - 1` and `rho` is the sum of the counts of how many times each integer in `eta` appears in `w`. `res` is the sum of `q[k] * (q[k] - 1) * (q[k] - 2) // 6` plus `q[k] * (q[k] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `k` in `eta` if `eta_ln` is not 1.***
