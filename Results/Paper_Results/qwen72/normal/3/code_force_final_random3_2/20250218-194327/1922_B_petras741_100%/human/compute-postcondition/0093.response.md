Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `i` is 1.
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. `w` is a list of integers input by the user.
5. `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1.
6. `j` is `n + eta_ln - 1`.
7. `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0.
8. `eta_ln` must be greater than 0.
9. `rho` is equal to the sum of all elements in `q` at indices in `eta`.
10. `res` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for all `j` in `eta` plus the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` in `eta` except the first one.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `q` Construction**:
   - `q` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all zeros.
   - For each `j` in the range `n`, the element at index `w[j]` in `q` is incremented by 1.
   - This means `q` will have non-zero values at the indices specified by `w`.

2. **List `eta` Construction**:
   - `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0.
   - In other words, `eta` contains the indices of `q` that have been incremented by 1 due to the elements in `w`.

3. **Variable `rho` Calculation**:
   - `rho` is the sum of all elements in `q` at indices in `eta`.
   - Since `q[eta[j]]` is non-zero for each `j` in `eta`, `rho` will be the sum of the non-zero elements in `q`.

4. **Variable `res` Calculation**:
   - `res` is calculated in two parts:
     - The first part is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for all `j` in `eta`.
     - The second part is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` in `eta` except the first one.
   - The first part calculates the number of ways to choose 3 elements from `q[eta[j]]` (if `q[eta[j]]` is at least 3).
   - The second part calculates the number of ways to choose 2 elements from `q[eta[j]]` and then multiplies by `rho` (if `q[eta[j]]` is at least 2), for all `j` in `eta` except the first one.

### Final Output:
The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the sum of the two parts described above. Since the exact values of `w` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for all `j` in `eta` plus the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` in `eta` except the first one)**
