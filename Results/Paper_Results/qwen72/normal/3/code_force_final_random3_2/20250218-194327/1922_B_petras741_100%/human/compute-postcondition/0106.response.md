The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `q[w[0]]` which is 1 and `q[w[1]]` which is now 1, `j` is 2**
