Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each a_i represents the exponent of the length of the i-th stick, 2^{a_i}. The input must be provided in the format described, and the sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 3 · 10^5. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers input by the user. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is the value of `q[eta[0]]` and is greater than 0. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the sum of all values in `q` at indices in `eta`, and `res` is the sum of the combinations of 3 and 2 from each value in `q` at indices in `eta`, plus the sum of the combinations of 2 from each value in `q` at indices in `eta` multiplied by the sum of all values in `q` at indices in `eta` up to the current index. If `n` is less than 3, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers input by the user. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1. `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `j` is `n + eta_ln - 1`, `rho` is equal to the sum of all elements in `q` at indices in `eta`, and `res` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for all `j` in `eta` plus the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` in `eta` except the first one. If `n` is less than 3, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers input by the user. If `n` is less than 3, no additional changes are made. If `n` is at least 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in the range of `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`. `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `j` is set to `n` and `rho` is the count of how many times `eta[0]` appears in `w`. If `eta_ln` is not 1, `j` is set to `eta_ln - 1` and `rho` is the sum of the counts of how many times each integer in `eta` appears in `w`. `res` is the sum of `q[k] * (q[k] - 1) * (q[k] - 2) // 6` plus `q[k] * (q[k] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `k` in `eta` if `eta_ln` is not 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
