Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`.**

Explanation:
- `rho` is assigned the value of `q[eta[0]]`, which is the first element in the list `eta` that contains indices where `q[j]` is greater than 0.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `q`, `j`, `eta`, and `eta_ln` remain unchanged.
- `rho` is now equal to the value at the index `eta[0]` in the list `q`.
