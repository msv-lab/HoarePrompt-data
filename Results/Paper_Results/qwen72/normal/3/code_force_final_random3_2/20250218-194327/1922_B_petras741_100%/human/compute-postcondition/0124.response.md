Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 (this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is 2 (this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
   - `w` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in the range of `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`.
   - `j` is `n` (this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) for which `q[k]` is greater than 0.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.
   - `eta_ln` is 1, which means `eta` contains exactly one element.
   - `rho` is the count of how many times `eta[0]` appears in `w`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement calculates the combination formula \( C(n, 3) \) which is the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection.
   - The formula \( C(n, 3) \) is given by \( \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6} \).
   - Since `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, the print statement will compute this value and print it.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value printed will be the result of the combination formula \( C(n, 3) \) for the given `n`.

Output: **\( \frac{n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{6} \) (where \( n \) is the input integer)**
