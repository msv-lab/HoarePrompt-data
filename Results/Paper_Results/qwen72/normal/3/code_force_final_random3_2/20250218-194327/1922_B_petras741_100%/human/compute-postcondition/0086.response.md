The value of `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its current value. Given that `j` is `n + 1`, and `eta` contains indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta[j]` is out of bounds. However, since the initial state does not specify the handling of out-of-bounds errors, we assume the program does not raise an error and the value of `res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` must be greater than `n + 1`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[n]]`, `res` is equal to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`.**
