Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in the range of `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is `n`, and `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) for which `q[k]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 2.
- The variable `n` is still the input integer, which must be at least 0.
- The list `w` remains unchanged.
- The list `q` remains unchanged, with each element `q[k]` representing the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`.
- The variable `j` has been incremented to `n` after the loop completes all iterations.
- The list `eta` now contains all integers `k` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) for which the count `q[k]` is greater than 0. This means that `eta` includes all the unique integers from the list `w` that are within the range of 0 to `n`.
