The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is 2, so `w[j]` refers to `w[2]`. The element at `w[2]` in the list `q` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except for the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, and `w[2]`, which are 1, `j` is 2.**
