Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, and `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `w` remain unchanged. The variable `q` is still a list of `n + 1` zeros, but it has been updated such that `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `j` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The list `eta` contains all the indices `j` from 0 to `n` where the corresponding value in `q` is greater than 0.
