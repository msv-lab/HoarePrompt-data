Functionality: ** The function `func` interacts with an external system or user through a series of queries to determine and output two indices, `mak2` and `mak`, from a permutation sequence `p` of integers from 0 to n-1. The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each test case, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4. The function does not return any value but prints the results of each test case to the standard output. After the function concludes, the output buffer is flushed, and the state of the program includes the processed test cases and the final values of `mak2` and `mak` for each test case. **
