The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `pans`. The loop will execute if `pans` has at least 2 elements, because `range(1, len(pans))` will generate a sequence starting from 1 and ending at `len(pans) - 1`, which requires `len(pans)` to be at least 2 for the loop to run at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is greater than 3 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is `n-1` (this value will be overwritten by the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted)
- `mak` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `mak2` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` for which the input was '=' during the loop execution, and the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' (if any)

To ensure the loop executes, `pans` must have at least 2 elements. The variable `i` will be set to 1 on the first iteration of the loop, so we do not need to adjust `i` explicitly.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements**
