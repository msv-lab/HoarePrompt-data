Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 4 elements.
   - `mak` is `n` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on whether the input was '>' or not.
   - `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<'.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is not relevant to the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `pans` is a list with at least 4 elements.
   - `mak` is determined based on the input:
     - If the input was '>', `mak` is `n`.
     - If the input was not '>', `mak` is 0 or `n-1` (depending on the exact condition, but we don't have enough information to determine which one it is).
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `pans[i]` will be the element at index `i` in the `pans` list.
   - The print statement will output a string with the format `? x x y y`, where `x` is `pans[mak]` and `y` is `pans[i]`.

4. **Determining the Values:**
   - Since `pans` has at least 4 elements, `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` are valid indices.
   - `mak` is either `n` or 0 or `n-1` based on the input condition.
   - `i` is `n + 1`, so `pans[i]` will be the element at index `n + 1` in the `pans` list.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string with the format `? x x y y`, where `x` is `pans[mak]` and `y` is `pans[i]`.
   - Since the exact values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` depend on the input and the contents of the `pans` list, we can only describe them in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i] (where `pans[mak]` is the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list, and `pans[i]` is the element at index `i` in the `pans` list. `mak` is `n` if the input was '>', otherwise it is 0 or `n-1`. `i` is `n + 1`.)**
