To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
```

The loop head involves the following objects:
- `i`: This is the loop variable, which will start from 1.
- `pans`: This is the list whose length determines the upper bound of the loop.

For the loop to execute, the `range` function must generate at least one value for `i`. This means that the upper bound of the range, `len(pans)`, must be greater than the lower bound, which is 1. Therefore, `len(pans)` must be at least 2.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `_` is 2.
- `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<'.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<'.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

The only state that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the length of `pans`. Specifically, `pans` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**
