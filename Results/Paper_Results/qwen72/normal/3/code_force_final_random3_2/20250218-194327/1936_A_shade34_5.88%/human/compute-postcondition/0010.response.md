Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the user input is a string that equals `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is 1. Otherwise, `mak` is 0.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`.
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, then `mak` is 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 2`.

Since the user input is not provided in the initial state, we need to consider both cases:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 1 if the user input is `<`, otherwise [mak] is 0)**
