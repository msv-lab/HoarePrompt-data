Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `s` is the new input string, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`. If `s` is '<', `pans` is a list containing `[1]`, and `mak` is 1. If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` remains an empty list, and `mak` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to the new input string.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `_`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions.
- The output buffer has already been flushed and remains in that state.
- The value of `mak` and the contents of `pans` depend on the new value of `s`, but the initial conditions for these variables are still valid.
