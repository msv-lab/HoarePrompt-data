Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<', `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was '>', or 0 if no '>' was ever input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be the last value it was assigned, which is `len(pans) - 1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`.
- **`_`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`pans`**: This list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`mak`**: `mak` is updated to the index `i` whenever the input is '>'. If no '>' is ever input, `mak` remains 0.
- **`mak2`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **Output Buffer**: The output buffer is flushed after each iteration, so it remains flushed after the loop completes.
