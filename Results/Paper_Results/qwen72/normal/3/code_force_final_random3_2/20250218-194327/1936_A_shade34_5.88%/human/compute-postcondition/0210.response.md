Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 3 elements, `mak` is `n` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on whether the input was '>' or not, `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.***
