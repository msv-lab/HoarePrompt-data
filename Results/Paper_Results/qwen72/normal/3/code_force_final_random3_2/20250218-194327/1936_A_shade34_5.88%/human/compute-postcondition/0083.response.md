Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the user input is '<', `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 0. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and `mak2` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first element in the print statement is a string literal `'?'`.
   - The second and third elements are `mak`. Based on the initial state, `mak` will be 1 if the user input is '<', and 0 otherwise.
   - The fourth and fifth elements are `i`. Based on the initial state, `i` is 2.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - If the user input is '<', the values of `mak` will be 1.
   - If the user input is not '<', the values of `mak` will be 0.
   - In both cases, the values of `i` will be 2.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If the user input is '<':
  Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
- If the user input is not '<':
  Output: **? 0 0 2 2**

Since the user input is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the task requires a single output based on the given information. Given the precondition, the most precise and general answer is:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 1 if the user input is '<', and 0 otherwise)**
