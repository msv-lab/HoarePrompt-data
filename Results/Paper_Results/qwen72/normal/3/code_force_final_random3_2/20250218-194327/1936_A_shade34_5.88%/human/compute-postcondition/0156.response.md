Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the user input is a string that is equal to `<`, then `mak` is set to 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - The value of `mak` is determined by the user input. If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 1. If the user input is anything else, `mak` is not set and will likely be `None` (assuming it is not initialized elsewhere).
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` will be 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`.
   - If the user input is not `<`, then `mak` will be `None`.
     - The print statement will output: `? None None 2 2`.

Since the initial state does not specify the user input, we need to consider both possibilities. However, based on the precondition, if the user input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 1. If it is not `<`, `mak` remains `None`.

Output: **? 1 1 2 2 (if user input is `<`) or ? None None 2 2 (if user input is not `<`)**
