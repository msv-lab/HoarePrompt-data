Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

In the given code snippet, there is a return statement without any value or variable specified to be returned. This means the function will return `None` by default in Python. However, since the task specifies to describe what the program returns and not to mention `None` explicitly, the output state is that the program returns nothing.
