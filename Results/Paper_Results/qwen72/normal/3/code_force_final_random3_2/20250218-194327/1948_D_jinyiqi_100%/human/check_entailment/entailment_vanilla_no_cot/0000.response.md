Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Call Order**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError` in Python. The function should be defined before it is called.

2. **Logic for Tandem Repeats**: The logic used to find the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring is flawed. The program checks if the characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are either equal or one of them is a question mark. However, this does not ensure that the substring from `k` to `k + j - 1` is equal to the substring from `k + j` to `k + 2*j - 1`, which is the requirement for a tandem repeat.

3. **Counting Mechanism**: The `count` variable is used to count the number of matching characters, but it does not correctly track the length of the tandem repeat substring. A tandem repeat substring should have both halves identical, not just individual matching characters.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, you need to:

1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Check for all possible even lengths of tandem repeats, starting from the largest possible length down to 2.
2. **Check Substrings**: For each length, check if there exists a substring of that length that can be a tandem repeat by replacing question marks appropriately.
3. **Return the Maximum Length**: If a valid tandem repeat is found, print its length and return. If no valid tandem repeat is found, print 0.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_tandem_repeat(s, length):
    half = length // 2
    for start in range(len(s) - length + 1):
        first_half = s[start:start + half]
        second_half = s[start + half:start + length]
        if all(a == b or a == '?' or b == '?' for a, b in zip(first_half, second_half)):
            return True
    return False

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    for length in range(n, 0, -1):
        if length % 2 == 0 and is_tandem_repeat(s, length):
            print(length)
            break
    else:
        print(0)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Function `is_tandem_repeat`**: This function checks if a substring of a given length can be a tandem repeat. It does this by comparing the first half of the substring with the second half, allowing for question marks to be replaced by any character.
2. **Main Loop**: For each test case, the program iterates over all possible even lengths of substrings, starting from the largest possible length down to 2. If a valid tandem repeat is found, it prints the length and breaks out of the loop. If no valid tandem repeat is found, it prints 0.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring after replacing question marks.
