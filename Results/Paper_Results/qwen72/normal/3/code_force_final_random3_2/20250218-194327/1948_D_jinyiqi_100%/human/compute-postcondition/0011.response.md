Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a list of characters from an input string, where the input string consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- The length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2.
- `j` is `n // 2`, which means `j` is half the length of `s` (integer division).
- `k` is 0.
- If `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1.
- Otherwise, `count` is 0 and `s[k]` is not a question mark, `s[k + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
- Additionally, `count` is equal to `j`.

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `j` and `k`**:
   - `j` is `n // 2`, so `j` is half the length of the list `s`.
   - `k` is 0.

2. **Check the conditions for `count`**:
   - The conditions for setting `count` are:
     - `s[k]` is a question mark.
     - `s[k + j]` is a question mark.
     - `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.
   - If any of these conditions are true, `count` is 1.
   - If none of these conditions are true, `count` is 0.
   - However, the initial state also states that `count` is equal to `j`.

3. **Reconcile the conditions**:
   - Since `count` is equal to `j`, and `j` is `n // 2`, `count` must be `n // 2`.
   - This means that the conditions for setting `count` to 1 are irrelevant because `count` is explicitly set to `j`.

4. **Calculate `count * 2`**:
   - `count` is `j`, and `j` is `n // 2`.
   - Therefore, `count * 2` is `(n // 2) * 2`, which simplifies to `n`.

### Final Output:
The `print(count * 2)` statement will print the length of the list `s`.

Output: **n (where n is the length of the list s)**
