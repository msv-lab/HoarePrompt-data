Reasoning:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. It then iterates over the range of `t`, calling `func_1()` for each test case. However, the function `func_1()` is called without passing the string `s` as an argument, which is a mistake. The function should be defined to accept `s` as an argument.

2. **Function Definition**: Inside `func_1()`, the string `s` is read from the input and converted to a list of characters. The length of the string `n` is then calculated.

3. **Loop for Tandem Repeat Check**: The program uses a nested loop to check for the longest possible tandem repeat. The outer loop iterates over possible half-lengths `j` of the tandem repeat, starting from the largest possible half-length (`n // 2`) down to 1. The inner loop checks each possible starting position `k` for a tandem repeat of length `2 * j`.

4. **Condition for Tandem Repeat**: The condition inside the inner loop checks if the characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are either the same or one of them is a question mark. If this condition is met, `count` is incremented. If the condition is not met, `count` is reset to 0.

5. **Output and Return**: If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the program prints `count * 2` and returns. If no tandem repeat is found after all iterations, the program prints 0.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where no tandem repeat can be formed (e.g., when the string contains no question marks and no repeated patterns).

However, the main issue is that `func_1()` is called without passing the string `s` as an argument. This will cause a runtime error because the function expects `s` to be defined within its scope, but it is not passed when the function is called.

To fix this, the function call should be modified to pass the string `s` as an argument:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    func_1(s)
```

And the function definition should be updated to accept `s` as an argument:

```python
def func_1(s):
    s = list(s)
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    print(0)
```

Given the current state of the program, it is incorrect due to the missing argument in the function call.

Correctness: **False**
