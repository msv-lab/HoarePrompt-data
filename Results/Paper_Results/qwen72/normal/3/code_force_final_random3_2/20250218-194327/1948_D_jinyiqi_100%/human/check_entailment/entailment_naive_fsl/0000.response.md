Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the string is a tandem repeat but contains no question marks. For example, for the input string "abab", the program will print 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 4, as "abab" is a tandem repeat of length 4. 

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the string can be modified to form a longer tandem repeat. For instance, for the input string "a?b?a?b", the program will print 2, but the correct output should be 6, as the string can be modified to "aabbab" or "ababab", both of which are tandem repeats of length 6.
