Functionality: **The function `func_1` is designed to process a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with the length of `s` between 1 and 5000 inclusive. The function returns a value of `count` which is 1 if any of the following conditions are met for a character at position `k` and its corresponding character at position `k + j` (where `j` is half the length of `s`): `s[k]` is a question mark, `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`. If none of these conditions are met, `count` is 0 and the function returns 0. The function does not return anything in other cases.**
