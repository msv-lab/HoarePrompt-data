Let's analyze the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a list of characters from an input string, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - The length of the input string is between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 4.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `k` is 2.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 3.
   - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - `s[k]` is not a question mark, `s[k + j]` is not a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
   - Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

3. **Determine `count` based on the conditions:**
   - `k` is 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - Therefore, `s[k]` is `s[2]` and `s[k + j]` is `s[3]`.
   - The conditions state that `s[2]` is not a question mark, `s[3]` is not a question mark, and `s[2]` is not equal to `s[3]`.
   - Given these conditions, the first condition (if `s[k]` is a question mark, or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`) is not met.
   - Therefore, `count` is 0.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(count * 2)`.
   - Since `count` is 0, `count * 2` is 0.

Output: **0**
