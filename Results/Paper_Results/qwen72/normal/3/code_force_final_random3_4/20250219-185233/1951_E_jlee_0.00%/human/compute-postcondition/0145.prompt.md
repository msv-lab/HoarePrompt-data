Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `done` remains False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0. If `count` > 0, `done` is True if the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` remains False. Additionally, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if any of the following conditions are met: `count2` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than `count`, `count2` is equal to `count`, or `count2` is greater than `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1, and the character at index `j` in `s` is equal to `x`. If `count` is 0, `count` remains 0 and `done` is False if the character at index `j` in `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` > 0, `done` is set to True. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` but `count2` is 0, `count` and `done` retain their original values. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1, and `count` and `done` retain their original values. If `count` is less than or equal to 0, `count` is set to 1 and `done` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2. If `count` > 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` == `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` == `count` and `count` <= 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 2. If `count2` == `count` and `count` <= 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` <= 0, the variables retain their initial values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
