The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The precondition describes various states and conditions of the program, but none of these conditions directly affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
