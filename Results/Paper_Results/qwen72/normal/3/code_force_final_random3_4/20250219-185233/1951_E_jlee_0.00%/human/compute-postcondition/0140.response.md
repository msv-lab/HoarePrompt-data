Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2. If `count2` == `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` == `count` and `count` <= 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 2. If `count2` == `count` and `count` <= 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` > `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` > `count` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2. Otherwise, the variables retain their initial values.***
