To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 3.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `s[j]` (which is `s[2]`) is not equal to `x` (the first character of `s`), and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 2.
   - If `s[j]` (which is `s[2]`) is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (which is `s[n - 3]`), then `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, the variables retain their initial values.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given the conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will always execute because it is not dependent on any of the conditions provided. The conditions only affect the values of `count` and `done`, but they do not influence the execution of the print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
