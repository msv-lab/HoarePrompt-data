Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is a new input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 3.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2 and `done` is True.
- Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `count` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and variable values, but none of these conditions or values affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, or `done`.

Output: **YES**
