Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, `count` is 1, `done` is True if the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` remains False, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
