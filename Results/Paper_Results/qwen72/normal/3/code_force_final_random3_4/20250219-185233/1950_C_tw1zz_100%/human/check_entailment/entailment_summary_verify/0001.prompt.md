You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" from the user, where `hh` is the hour (from '00' to '23') and `mm` is the minute (from '00' to '59'). The function converts the hour part of the time string to a 12-hour format and determines whether it is 'AM' or 'PM'. It then prints the time in the format "hh:mm AM/PM" for each input time. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1440, and `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm". The variables `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `time` are used internally and are not retained after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the time in 24-hour format using `input().split(':')` and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

2. **Time Conversion:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hour `h` to the 12-hour format hour `h1` and determine whether it is AM or PM.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, the program correctly sets `h1` to the same value and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, the program correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, the program correctly converts `h` to the corresponding 12-hour format hour by subtracting 12 and sets `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, the program correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM`.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.
   - The `sep=''` argument ensures that there are no extra spaces between the components of the time string.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as `00:00`, `12:00`, `23:59`, and all other valid times correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly converts the 24-hour format time to the 12-hour format time and prints it in the required format.
