Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h1` is '10', `time` is 'PM'.**

The code snippet assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1440, `s` is still a string in the format "hh:mm", `h` is still the hour part of `s`, `m` is still the minute part of `s`, `m1` is still equal to `m`, and `h1` is still '10'.
