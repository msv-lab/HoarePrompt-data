Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h1` is '08', `time` is 'AM'.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the string 'AM' to the variable `time`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, `h1`) remain unchanged.
