Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `h` is '11', `m` is the minute part of the input string, `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM'.**

The code assigns the string 'AM' to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values.
