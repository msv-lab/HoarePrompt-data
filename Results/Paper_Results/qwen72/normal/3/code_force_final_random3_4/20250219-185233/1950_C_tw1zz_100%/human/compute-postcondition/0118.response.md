Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, `h` is the hour part of the input string, `m` is the minute part of the input string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is not equal to '04', '02', '01', or '03'. If `h` is '05', `h1` is set to '05' and `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is '06', '07', or '08', `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is '09', '10', or '11', `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is set to the corresponding hour in 12-hour format (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.) and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is not '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.***
