The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" from the user, where `hh` is the hour (from '00' to '23') and `mm` is the minute (from '00' to '59'). The function converts the hour part of the time string to a 12-hour format and determines whether it is 'AM' or 'PM'. It then prints the time in the format "hh:mm AM/PM" for each input time. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1440, and `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm". The variables `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `time` are used internally and are not retained after the function execution.
