The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function accepts four parameters: `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers for each test case where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so it is unclear what the function returns. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function returns a value or a set of values that are computed using these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a value or set of values based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.**
