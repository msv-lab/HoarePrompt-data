Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, and `s` is the second line of the input file. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `x` is equal to `k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 2`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 2` and not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and `z` is the result of the loop body being applied `x - k + 3` times. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the program retains these conditions. If `a` is less than `z`, the program also retains these conditions.***
