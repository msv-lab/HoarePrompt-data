Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the fourth line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the fourth line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the fourth line of the input file, `s` is the fourth line of the input file, `z` is `k - 2`.**

The value of `z` is now `k - 2`, where `k` is the first integer from the fourth line of the input file. All other variables remain unchanged.
