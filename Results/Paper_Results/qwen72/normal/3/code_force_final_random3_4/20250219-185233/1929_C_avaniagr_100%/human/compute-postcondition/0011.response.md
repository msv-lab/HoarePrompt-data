Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30.
   - `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100.
   - `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9.
   - `s` is the second line of the input file.
   - `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the integer values from the second line of the input file.
   - Additionally, `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
   - The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.
   - The conditions provided (such as `x = k - 1` and `a >= x + 2`) are not used in the `print` statement and do not influence the output.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables.

Output: **YES**
