Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is the first integer from the fourth line of the input file.
- `x` is the second integer from the fourth line of the input file.
- `a` is the third integer from the fourth line of the input file.
- `s` is the fourth line of the input file.
- `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` is `x - k + 2`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, where `z` is the result of the expression \(k - 2 + (x - k + 3) \times (1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1))\).

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0**
   - This condition ensures that `x` is at least `k - 3` or greater. This is a necessary condition for the subsequent calculations.

2. **Condition 2: `i` is `x - k + 2`**
   - Given that `x - k + 3` is non-negative, `i` will be at least 1 (since `x - k + 2` is one less than `x - k + 3`).

3. **Condition 3: `a` is greater than or equal to `z`**
   - `z` is calculated as \(k - 2 + (x - k + 3) \times (1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1))\).
   - Let's break down the expression for `z`:
     - \((k - 2) // (k - 1)\) is the integer division of \(k - 2\) by \(k - 1\). For \(k > 2\), this will be 0 because \(k - 2\) is less than \(k - 1\).
     - Therefore, the expression simplifies to \(k - 2 + (x - k + 3) \times 1\), which is \(k - 2 + x - k + 3\).
     - Simplifying further, \(z = x + 1\).

4. **Condition 4: `a` is greater than or equal to `z`**
   - Since `z` is \(x + 1\), this condition means that `a` must be greater than or equal to \(x + 1\).

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print 'YES' if all the conditions are met. Specifically:
- `x - k + 3` is non-negative.
- `i` is `x - k + 2`.
- `a` is greater than or equal to \(x + 1\).

Since the conditions are described as being true in the initial state, the `print('YES')` statement will indeed print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
