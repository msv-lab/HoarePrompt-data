Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is odd, `s` is not defined. If the length of `s` is less than 200, the condition `len(s) < 200` holds. If the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200, the condition `len(s) >= 200` holds.***
