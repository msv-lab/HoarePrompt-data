Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67.
   - The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.
   - If `n` is odd, `s` is not defined.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'YES'.
   - The initial state provides information about `t`, `_`, `n`, and `s`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, or `s`.

Output: **YES**
