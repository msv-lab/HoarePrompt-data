The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `t` will remain the same for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `_`, or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.**
