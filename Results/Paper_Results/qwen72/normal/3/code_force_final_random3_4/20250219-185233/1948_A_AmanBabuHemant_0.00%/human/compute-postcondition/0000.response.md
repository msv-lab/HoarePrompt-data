Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should not exceed 200 characters. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO". `t` is an input integer.**
