You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should not exceed 200 characters. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `_` is `t-1`, `t` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `_`, or `n`, and `s` is not defined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200 characters, the function prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 characters or more, the function prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed, with the appropriate output printed for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to produce a string of uppercase Latin letters. Instead, it generates a string of '1's and '0's, which are not uppercase Latin letters. For example, for `n = 6`, the program outputs `110110110110`, which is not a valid string as per the problem description. The program should generate a string like `AAABAACC` instead.
