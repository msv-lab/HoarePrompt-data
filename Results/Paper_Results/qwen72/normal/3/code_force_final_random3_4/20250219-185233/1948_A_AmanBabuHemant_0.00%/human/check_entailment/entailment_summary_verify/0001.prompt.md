You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If `n` is odd, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200 characters, the function prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 characters or more, the function prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` test cases have been processed, with the appropriate output printed for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each one.

2. **Special Character Condition**: The problem requires that the string contains exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program checks if `n` is odd or even using `if n % 2:`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is part of a pair (since each special character must be matched with a neighbor).

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each '1' in the string is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the other '1' in the pair '11'). The '0' in the pattern is not a special character because it is not equal to either of its neighbors.

4. **String Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'. However, the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, there is a solution of length at most 200. Since the pattern '110' is used and `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is always less than 200. Therefore, the length check is redundant and can be removed.

5. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints the output in the required format for each test case: 'NO' if no solution exists, or 'YES' followed by the constructed string if a solution exists.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in terms of logic and output format, but the length check is unnecessary. However, the presence of the length check does not affect the correctness of the program for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
