Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2.
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The length of `s` is less than 200 if `n // 2` is less than 67.
   - The length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200 if `n // 2` is 67 or more.
   - If `n` is odd, `s` is not defined.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string 'YES'.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `_`, `t`, and `n`, as well as the conditions under which `s` is defined.
   - However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It is a standalone statement that prints a fixed string.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the values of `_`, `t`, `n`, or the definition of `s`, the `print` statement will always print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
