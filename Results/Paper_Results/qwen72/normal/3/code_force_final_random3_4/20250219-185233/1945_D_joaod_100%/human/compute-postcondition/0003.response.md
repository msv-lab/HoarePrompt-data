Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers.**

The initial state remains the same for all variables except `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is now a list of integers obtained from the input.
