Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `b` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.**
