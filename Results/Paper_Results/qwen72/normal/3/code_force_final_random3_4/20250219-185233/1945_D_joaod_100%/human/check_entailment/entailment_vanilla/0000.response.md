### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `na_frente` and the maximum allowable final position `pos_final`.
   - It then reads the costs `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each person in the queue.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from each. This is necessary because the problem description uses 1-based indexing, while Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the total cost Kirill needs to spend.
   - `best` is initialized to `sys.float_info.max`, which is a very large number to ensure that any valid cost will be less than this initial value.

4. **Iterating Backwards:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue (`na_frente` to 0) to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `pos_final` positions.
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the range of `pos_final`, the program checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
     - The program then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total` to account for the cost of moving to the next position.
     - If `v` is not within the range of `pos_final`, the program simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all positions, the program prints the best cost found for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The program correctly identifies the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `pos_final` positions.
- The logic for updating `best` and `total` is sound and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.
- The use of `sys.float_info.max` ensures that the initial value of `best` is large enough to be updated by any valid cost.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `pos_final` is 0, which is not possible according to the problem constraints (1 ≤ m ≤ n). However, since the problem guarantees valid inputs, this is not a concern.
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where `na_frente` is 0, but the loop will not run in this case, and the program will correctly output 0 as the cost.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `pos_final` positions by iterating backwards and keeping track of the best cost.

### Correctness:
**True**
