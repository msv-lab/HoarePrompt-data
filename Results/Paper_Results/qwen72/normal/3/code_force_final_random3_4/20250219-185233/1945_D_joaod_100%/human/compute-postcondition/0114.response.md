Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 2 and must be at least -1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 3, `v` is `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `total` is 0, `best` is the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`), and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
