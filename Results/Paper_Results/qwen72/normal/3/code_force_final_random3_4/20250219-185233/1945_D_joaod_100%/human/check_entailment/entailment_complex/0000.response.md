### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the two lists `a` and `b` which represent the costs to bribe people.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The function adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from each. This is necessary because the problem uses 1-based indexing, but Python lists use 0-based indexing.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total cost of bribes.
   - `best` is initialized to `sys.float_info.max` to ensure it starts with a value that is higher than any possible total cost.

4. **Loop Through People:**
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` (which is `n-1` after adjustment) down to 0. This is correct because Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only move forward by bribing people ahead of him.
   - For each person `v` in the queue, the function checks if `v` is within the desired final position `pos_final`.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `v` is within the desired final position (`v <= pos_final`), the function updates `best` to the minimum of `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. This is to keep track of the minimum cost to reach a position no greater than `m`.
   - The function then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. This is correct because Kirill will choose the cheaper option to bribe the person at position `v` or the people between `j` and `i`.

6. **Outside the Desired Position:**
   - If `v` is outside the desired final position (`v > pos_final`), the function still adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. This is correct because Kirill will still need to bribe people to move forward, even if they are not in the final desired range.

7. **Output:**
   - After processing all people in the queue, the function prints the minimum cost stored in `best`.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case, calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m`, and prints the result. The logic for updating `best` and `total` is sound and follows the rules of the problem.

However, there is a potential issue in the loop where the function updates `best` and `total`:
- The condition `if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` should be checked only when `v` is within the desired final position (`v <= pos_final`). This ensures that `best` is updated only when Kirill is considering a valid final position.
- The loop should correctly accumulate the minimum cost for Kirill to move forward, and the final `best` value should be the minimum cost to reach a position no greater than `m`.

Given these points, the program is logically correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
