Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is at least 2, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` remains the maximum float value.** 

The value of `total` is increased by the value at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
