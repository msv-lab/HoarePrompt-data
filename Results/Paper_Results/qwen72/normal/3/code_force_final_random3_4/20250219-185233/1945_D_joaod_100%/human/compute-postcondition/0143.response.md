The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function will likely accept input through some means (e.g., global variables, input from a file, or user input). The input consists of multiple test cases, each defined by the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` and `m`: integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.
  - `a`: a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the i-th person.
  - `b`: a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the additional cost to bribe each person between positions j and i.

The function processes each test case and returns the minimum total cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue. If it is impossible for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m`, the function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people in the queue (`n`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`m`), the cost to bribe each person (`a`), and the additional cost to bribe each person between positions (`b`). It returns the minimum total cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue. If it is impossible for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m`, it returns -1.**
