Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `b` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0 where `v` ≤ `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers input by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all iterations where `v` ≤ `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 2 and must be at least -1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 3, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0, and `best` is the minimum total cost of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for any `v` that is less than or equal to `pos_final`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
