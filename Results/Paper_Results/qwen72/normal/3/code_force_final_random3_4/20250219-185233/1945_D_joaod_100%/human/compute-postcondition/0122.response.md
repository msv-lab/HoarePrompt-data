Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 2 and must be at least -1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 3, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, and `total` is updated based on the comparison between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `best` remains its original value or `sys.float_info.max` if `v` is greater than `pos_final`.***
