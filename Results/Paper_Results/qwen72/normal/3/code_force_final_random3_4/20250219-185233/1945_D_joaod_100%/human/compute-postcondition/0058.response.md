Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `total` is 0, `best` is the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`), and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, the current value of `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**
