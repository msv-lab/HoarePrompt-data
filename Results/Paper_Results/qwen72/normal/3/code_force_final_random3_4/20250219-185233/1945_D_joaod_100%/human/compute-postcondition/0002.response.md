Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer.** 

The values of `t`, `cases`, and `c` remain unchanged. `na_frente` and `pos_final` are assigned the values from the input, which are split into two integers.
