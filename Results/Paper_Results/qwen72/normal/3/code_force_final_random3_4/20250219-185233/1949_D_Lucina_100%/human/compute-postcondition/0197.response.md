Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 3, and `nx` is updated as follows: If `xx[3][2]` is not '?', `nx` is increased by `xx[3][2]`. If `xx[3][2]` is '?', 'F' is appended to `nx` if 3 is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), otherwise 'S' is appended to `nx`. If `xx[3][2]` is '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, 'S' is appended to `nx`.***
