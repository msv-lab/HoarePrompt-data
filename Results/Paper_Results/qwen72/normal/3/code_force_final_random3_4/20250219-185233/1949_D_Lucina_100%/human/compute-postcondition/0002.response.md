Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of `n` lines, each containing `n` characters, where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j, and the character at the i-th row and i-th column is always '.'. At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, meaning at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'. `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
