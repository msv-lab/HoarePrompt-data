### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and initializes arrays `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings, with an empty string at the beginning to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting Known Transitions:**
   - The program reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row in the transition matrix.
   - For each character in the input string, it updates the counts in `a` and `b` if the character is 'F' or 'S', respectively.
   - The input string is stored in `xx` for later use.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists, `sa` and `sb`, to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - This step is correct and helps in identifying scenarios that are already biased towards one type of transition.

4. **Deciding Transitions for Undecided Pairs:**
   - The program decides the transitions for the undecided pairs ('?') based on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`.
   - If `sa` is longer or equal to `sb`, it tries to balance the number of funny and scary transitions by assigning 'F' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest.
   - If `sb` is longer, it does the opposite, assigning 'S' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sb` and 'F' to the rest.
   - This approach is flawed because it only considers the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` or `sb` for assignment, which may not be sufficient to ensure that no more than `3n/4` consecutive transitions of the same type occur for all permutations of scenarios.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program constructs the output strings by replacing '?' with the decided values and prints them.
   - The output matrix is symmetric by construction, as it is based on the input matrix which is symmetric.

### Analysis:

- **Balancing Transitions:**
  - The program's approach to balancing the transitions is not robust enough to ensure that the requirement of no more than `3n/4` consecutive transitions of the same type is met for all permutations of scenarios.
  - The logic for assigning 'F' and 'S' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` or `sb` is insufficient. It does not consider the overall distribution of transitions across all permutations, which is crucial for ensuring the correctness of the solution.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of known transitions is very low or very high, which could lead to incorrect assignments.
  - For example, if `n` is 5 and there are no known transitions (all '?'), the program will assign 'F' to the first `5 // 4 - 1 = 0` scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest, which is not a valid solution.

- **Symmetry:**
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix is symmetric by reading the input and storing it in `xx`, and the output is constructed based on this symmetric input. However, the correctness of the solution is not guaranteed by symmetry alone.

### Conclusion:

The program's approach to balancing the transitions is not sufficient to guarantee that no more than `3n/4` consecutive transitions of the same type will occur for all permutations of scenarios. The logic for assigning transitions to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios is flawed and does not consider the overall distribution of transitions. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Final: False**
