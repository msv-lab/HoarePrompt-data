Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 3 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 3, `b[1]` is incremented by 1, `b[3]` is incremented by 1, `a[2]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged.**

The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[3]` by 1, as `j` is 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
