Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at position 0 in `xx[1]`. Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
