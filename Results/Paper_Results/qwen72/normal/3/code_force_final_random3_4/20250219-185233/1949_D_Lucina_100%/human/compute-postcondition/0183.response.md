Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 1, `nx` is 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. Additionally, `i` is not in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, and `j` is not in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.**
