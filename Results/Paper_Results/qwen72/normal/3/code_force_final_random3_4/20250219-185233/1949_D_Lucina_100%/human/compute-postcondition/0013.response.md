Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `j` is 1, and `b[1]` is incremented by 1.**

The value of `b[1]` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `i`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged. The character at the first position of `x` is still 'S' (and not 'F').
