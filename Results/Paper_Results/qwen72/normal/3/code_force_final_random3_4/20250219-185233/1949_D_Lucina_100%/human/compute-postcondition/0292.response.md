Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `sa` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the indices of all positions from 1 to `n` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `nx` is a string of length `n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. For each `i` and `j` from 1 to `n`, if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not a question mark (`?`), `nx` contains the character at `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is a question mark (`?`), `nx` contains 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, otherwise it contains 'S'. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, for each position `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` now includes the index `i`, otherwise the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged. `nx` is a string of length `n` constructed for each `i` from 1 to `n` by iterating through `xx[i]` from index 0 to `n - 1`. For each character in `xx[i]`, if it is not `?`, it is appended to `nx`. If it is `?` and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.***
