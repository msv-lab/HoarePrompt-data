Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `x` is a new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x` as its last element, `j` is 3. If the third character of `x` is 'F', then `a[2]` and `a[3]` are each increased by 1, and `b[2]` remains unchanged. If the third character of `x` is 'S', then `b[2]` and `b[3]` are each increased by 1, and `a[2]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, both `a[2]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged.***
