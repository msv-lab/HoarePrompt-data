The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure the loop condition `j < n` is met.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1, and `done` remains False.**
