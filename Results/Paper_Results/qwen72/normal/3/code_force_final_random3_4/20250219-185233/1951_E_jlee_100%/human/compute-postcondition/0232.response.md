Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 1, `j` is 1, `count2` is 1, `done` remains False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop.**
