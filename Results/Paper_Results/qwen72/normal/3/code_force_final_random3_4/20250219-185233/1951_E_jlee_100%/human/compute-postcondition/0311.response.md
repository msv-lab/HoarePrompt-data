The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the loop control is affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x`, `done` is False. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
