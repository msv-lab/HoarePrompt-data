Let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is updated to 2 and `done` remains False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`.
   - Otherwise, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Understanding the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.
   - `string[:j]` will print the first `j` characters of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will print the characters of `string` starting from index `j` to the end.

3. **Evaluating the values:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - `string[:j]` will print the first 2 characters of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will print the characters of `string` starting from index 2 to the end.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will split the `string` into two parts: the first 2 characters and the rest of the string starting from the third character.

Output: **[first 2 characters of string], [rest of the string starting from the third character]**
