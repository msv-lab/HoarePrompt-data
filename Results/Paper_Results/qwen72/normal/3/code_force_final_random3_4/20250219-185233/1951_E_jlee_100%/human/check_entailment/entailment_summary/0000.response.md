### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string` and converts it to a list `s` for easier manipulation.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character String**: If the string has only one character, it is a palindrome, and the function correctly prints 'NO'.
   - **All Characters the Same**: If all characters in the string are the same, the function correctly identifies that no valid partition exists and prints 'NO'.
   - **Almost All Characters the Same**: If all but one character are the same, the function checks if the string can be partitioned into a valid non-palindromic substring. It correctly handles this case by checking the middle character for odd-length strings and ensuring the partition is valid.

3. **General Case**:
   - The function checks if the first and last characters of the string are different. If they are, the entire string is already a non-palindrome, and the function prints 'YES' followed by the string itself as a single part.
   - If the first and last characters are the same, the function attempts to find a valid partition by iterating through the string and looking for the first character that is different from the first character. It then checks if this character can be used to form a valid partition.
   - The function correctly handles the case where it finds a valid partition by printing 'YES', the number of parts (2), and the substrings.

4. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the function. It processes each test case, checks for the conditions mentioned, and prints the appropriate output.
   - The function does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem description that requires printing the results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the edge cases and the general case as described in the problem. It prints the correct output for each test case and follows the specified format. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
