Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is 1, `done` is False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the current iteration of the loop to end and the next iteration to begin. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
