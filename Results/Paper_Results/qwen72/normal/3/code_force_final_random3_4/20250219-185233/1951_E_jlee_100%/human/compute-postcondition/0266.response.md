Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is 2, `done` is False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for `done` are still valid.
