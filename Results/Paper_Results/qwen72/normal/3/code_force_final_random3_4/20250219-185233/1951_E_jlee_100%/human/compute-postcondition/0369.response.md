The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `done`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Output: **YES**
