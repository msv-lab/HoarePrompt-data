To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was originally less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(string[:j], string[j:])
   ```

### Analysis:
- `j` is set to 1.
- The `print` statement will split the `string` into two parts:
  - `string[:j]` will print the substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j`.
  - `string[j:]` will print the substring from the character at index `j` to the end of the string.

### Values:
- `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string` because `j` is 1.
- `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Output:
Output: **[first character of string], [rest of the string starting from the second character]**

For example, if `string` is "hello":
- `string[:j]` will be "h".
- `string[j:]` will be "ello".

So the output will be:
Output: **h, ello**
