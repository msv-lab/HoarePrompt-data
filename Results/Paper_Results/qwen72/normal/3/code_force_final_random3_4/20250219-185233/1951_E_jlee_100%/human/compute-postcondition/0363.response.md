Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, and the current character `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to or greater than `count`, `done` is also set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is less than `count` and `count` is 1, `count2` is set to 0, `done` remains False, and the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop it is in. Otherwise, `done` remains False.***
