Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j` and `done` remains False. Otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `done` remains False.***
