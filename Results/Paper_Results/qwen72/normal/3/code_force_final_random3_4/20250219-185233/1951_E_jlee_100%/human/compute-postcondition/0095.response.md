To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, `done` retains its original value.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was originally less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is not dependent on any of the conditions described. It simply prints the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, or `j`.
   - The conditions provided are used to control the flow of a loop or if statement, but they do not affect the `print('YES')` statement directly.

Therefore, the `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES' when it is executed.

Output: **YES**
