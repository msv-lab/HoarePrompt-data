To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `count` is the position of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the position `count`.
- `done` is False.
- If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins.

Given these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement is executed. However, the context provided does not specify any loop or conditional logic that might affect the execution of this `print` statement. The `print` statement is a simple command that prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
