Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is 2, `done` is False if `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
