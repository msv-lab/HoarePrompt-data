Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem but fails to correctly handle all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Single Character String**: The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO".

2. **Strings with All Characters the Same**: The program correctly identifies that a string where all characters are the same cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO".

3. **Strings with One Different Character**: The program correctly identifies that a string with one different character in the middle (if the length is odd) cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO". However, it incorrectly handles the case where the length is even and there is one different character. For example, for the string "aaabaa", the program should print "YES" with a partition like "aaab" and "aa", but it incorrectly prints "NO".

4. **General Case**: The program's logic for finding a partition is overly complex and does not correctly handle all cases. For example, for the string "abcba", the program should print "YES" with a partition like "ab" and "cba", but it does not.

A simpler and more correct approach would be:

- If the string has a length of 1, print "NO".
- If the string has a length of 2, print "YES" and the string itself.
- If the string has a length greater than 2, check if the string is a palindrome. If it is not, print "YES" and the string itself.
- If the string is a palindrome, try to partition it into two non-palindromic substrings. If possible, print "YES" and the partition. If not, print "NO".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        if not is_palindrome(string):
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            continue
        
        # Try to partition the string into two non-palindromic substrings
        for i in range(1, n):
            if not is_palindrome(string[:i]) and not is_palindrome(string[i:]):
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:i], string[i:])
                break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version handles all the cases correctly and is much simpler to understand and maintain.
