Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Handling of Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program checks if `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3` and `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
   - The condition `if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is too restrictive and can incorrectly output `-1` in cases where it is possible to accommodate all participants.

2. **Calculation of Tents:**
   - The program calculates the number of tents as `k += a + (b + c) // 3` and then adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. This approach does not correctly handle the distribution of extroverts and universals.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the minimum number of tents, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Introverts:**
   - Each introvert requires a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents needed for introverts is `a`.

2. **Extroverts:**
   - Each tent for extroverts must contain exactly 3 people. Therefore, we need `b` extroverts to be placed in `b // 3` tents, and we will have `b % 3` extroverts left over.

3. **Universals:**
   - Universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts. If there are `b % 3` extroverts left over, we need at least `3 - (b % 3)` universals to fill the remaining spots in the tent.
   - If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, it is impossible to accommodate all participants.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The total number of tents is the sum of tents for introverts, tents for extroverts, and any additional tents needed for the remaining universals.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Tents for introverts
        tents = a
        
        # Tents for extroverts
        full_extrovert_tents = b // 3
        remaining_extroverts = b % 3
        
        # Check if we have enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the extrovert tents
        if remaining_extroverts > 0:
            if c < 3 - remaining_extroverts:
                print(-1)
                continue
            else:
                c -= 3 - remaining_extroverts
                tents += full_extrovert_tents + 1
        else:
            tents += full_extrovert_tents
        
        # Tents for remaining universals
        if c > 0:
            tents += (c + 2) // 3
        
        print(tents)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Introverts:** Each introvert requires a separate tent, so we add `a` to the total number of tents.
- **Extroverts:** We calculate the number of full tents needed for extroverts (`b // 3`) and the number of remaining extroverts (`b % 3`).
- **Universals:** If there are remaining extroverts, we check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots. If not, we output `-1`. If there are enough universals, we use them and update the count of remaining universals.
- **Remaining Universals:** We then calculate the number of tents needed for the remaining universals, which is `(c + 2) // 3` because each tent can hold up to 3 people.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
