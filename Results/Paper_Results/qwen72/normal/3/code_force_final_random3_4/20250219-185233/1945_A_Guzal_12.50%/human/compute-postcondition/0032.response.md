The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot describe what the function returns. 

To properly describe the functionality, we need more information about the output or the intended behavior of the function. However, based on the given constraints, we can describe the parameters the function accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The return value is not specified.**
