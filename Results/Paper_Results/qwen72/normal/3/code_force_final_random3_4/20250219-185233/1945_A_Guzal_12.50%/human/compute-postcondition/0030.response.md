Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three input integers, `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3` and `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k + a + (b + c) // 3`. If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` is further incremented by 1.***
