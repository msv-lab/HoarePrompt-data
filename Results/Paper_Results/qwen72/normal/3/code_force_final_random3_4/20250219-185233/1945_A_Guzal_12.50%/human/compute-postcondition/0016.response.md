The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The **initial state** describes the values of several variables: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three input integers, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `k` is 0.
- The conditions for `k` remain unchanged from the previous iteration, but this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

### Output:
The code prints the integer `-1`.
Output: **-1**
