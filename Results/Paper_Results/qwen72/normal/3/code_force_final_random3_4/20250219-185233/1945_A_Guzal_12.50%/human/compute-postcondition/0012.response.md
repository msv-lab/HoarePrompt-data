Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three input integers, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If `b` is not divisible by 3, `c` is less than 3, and the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, either `b` is divisible by 3, `c` is greater than or equal to 3, or the sum of `b` and `c` is divisible by 3, and `k` is updated to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, or `k` is updated to `a + (b + c) // 3` if the sum of `b` and `c` is divisible by 3.***
