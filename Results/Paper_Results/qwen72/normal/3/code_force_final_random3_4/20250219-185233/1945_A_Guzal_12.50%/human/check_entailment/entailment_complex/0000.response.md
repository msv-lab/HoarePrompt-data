Reasoning:

1. **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert requires a separate tent, so the number of tents needed for introverts is `a`.

2. **Extroverts (b)**: Each tent for extroverts must contain exactly 3 people. Therefore, we need to check if the number of extroverts `b` can be completely accommodated in groups of 3. If `b % 3 != 0`, we need to use some universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. 

3. **Universals (c)**: Universals can be used to fill any remaining spots in the tents. If `b % 3 != 0`, we need at least `3 - (b % 3)` universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. If `c` is less than this required number, it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, and we should output `-1`.

4. **Tent Calculation**:
   - For introverts, we need `a` tents.
   - For extroverts, we need `(b + c) // 3` tents to accommodate as many extroverts and universals as possible in groups of 3.
   - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, we need one additional tent to accommodate the remaining participants.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3`, and `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it is impossible to accommodate all participants, and the function correctly outputs `-1`.
   - If `b % 3 == 0` or `c >= 3 - (b % 3)`, the function correctly calculates the number of tents needed.

6. **Overall Logic**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It checks if it is possible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.
   - It calculates the number of tents needed and prints it.

Based on the above reasoning, the program seems to correctly handle the given problem and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
