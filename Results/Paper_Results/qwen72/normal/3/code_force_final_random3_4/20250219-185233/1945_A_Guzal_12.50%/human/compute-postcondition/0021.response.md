Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three input integers, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is updated: if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is set to `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. If `(b + c) % 3 == 0`, `k` is set to `k + a + (b + c) // 3`.***
