Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 1 + k` if the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is exactly 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x + y - 2 + k` where `k` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is 2. `tmp` is a list containing the values `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is an even number but not 2. If the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is not 2 and is an even number, `tmp` now includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. `tmp` is now sorted.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` must have at least one element, and `i` is the first element in `tmp`. If `y` >= `i - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`, and `ans` is updated to `x + y - 1 + k + i` if the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is exactly 2. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `x + y - 2 + k + i` where `k` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is 2. If `y` < `i - 1`, then `ans` is updated to `x + y - 1 + k` if the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is exactly 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x + y - 2 + k` where `k` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` whose difference is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the second element in `tmp`, and `tmp` must have at least 2 elements. If `y` >= `i` - 1, `y` is updated to `y` - (`i` - 1) and `ans` is increased by the value of `i`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the third element in `tmp`, and `tmp` must have at least 3 elements. If `y` >= `i` - 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `i`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
