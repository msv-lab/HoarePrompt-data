Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, `i` is 1, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number.**

Explanation:
- The code `tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)` appends the result of `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` to the list `tmp`.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`.
- The difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is an even number, and dividing an even number by 2 results in an integer.
- The list `tmp` is now a list containing one element, which is the integer result of `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
