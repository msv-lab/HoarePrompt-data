Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, and `i` is 2. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, `ans` is `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, and `tmp` is an empty list if the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is not even, otherwise `tmp` contains the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` plus 1. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is not 2, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, and `tmp` is an empty list if the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is not even, otherwise `tmp` contains the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.**
