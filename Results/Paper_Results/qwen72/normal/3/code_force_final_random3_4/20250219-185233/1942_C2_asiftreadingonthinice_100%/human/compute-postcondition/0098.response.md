Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the second element in `tmp`, `tmp` must contain at least two elements. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by `i`, and `y` is updated to `y - i + 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`. In both cases, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2.**
