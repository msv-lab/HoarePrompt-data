Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, and `i` is 3. If `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` now includes the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` remains as previously defined. `ans` remains as previously defined.***
