Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 2`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 1` and `tmp` remains an empty list. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number but not 2, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 1` and `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number but not 2, otherwise `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not 2 and not an even number, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 2` and `tmp` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `ans` is equal to `x + y` or `x + y - 1` or `x + y - 2` depending on the conditions described. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `tmp` is a list that may contain the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` or `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` depending on the conditions described or remains an empty list. Otherwise, `tmp` is a list that contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, or remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
