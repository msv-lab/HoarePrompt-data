Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 4 elements, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 2, `i` is 3, `ans` remains as previously defined, and `tmp` now includes the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` appended to it.**

The code snippet appends the result of `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. The values of `a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `t`, `ii`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `ans` also remains unchanged. The list `tmp` now has an additional element, which is the integer division of the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of the list `a`.
