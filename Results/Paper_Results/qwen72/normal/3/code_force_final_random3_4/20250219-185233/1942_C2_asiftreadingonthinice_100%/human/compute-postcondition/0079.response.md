Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the last element in `a`, `tmp` is a list that may contain elements, each of which is the result of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range [1, len(a) - 1] where `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) != 2`, `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, and the sum of the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is 2.**
