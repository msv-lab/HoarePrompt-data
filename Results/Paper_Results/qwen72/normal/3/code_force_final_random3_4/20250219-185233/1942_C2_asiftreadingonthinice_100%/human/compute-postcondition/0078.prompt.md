Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is the last element in `tmp`, `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `tmp` is an empty list or a list containing a single element which is the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`, and `ans` is `x + y - 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `tmp` is a list that may be empty or contain a single element which is the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is updated to `y - sum((i - 1) for i in tmp if y >= i - 1)`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tt` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `ii` is 1, the list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range [1, n], `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, and `tmp` is a list that may be empty or contain a single element which is the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, `y` is updated to `y - 1` and `ans` is `x + y - 1`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even but not 2, `y` is updated to `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` and `ans` is `x + y - 2`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is odd, `tmp` remains empty, and `ans` is `x + y - 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
