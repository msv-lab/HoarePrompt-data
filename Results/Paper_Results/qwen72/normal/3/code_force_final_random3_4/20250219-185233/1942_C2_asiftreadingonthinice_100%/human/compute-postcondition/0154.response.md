Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `y - (i - 1)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ii` is 3, `i` is the third element in `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the values of `(a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2` for all `j` in the range 1 to the length of `a` - 1 where `(a[j] - a[j-1]) % 2 == 0` and is not 2, and `tmp` must have at least three elements, `ans` is the value of the third element in `tmp`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated by subtracting `i - 1` from its original value. The value of `i` is the third element in `tmp`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
