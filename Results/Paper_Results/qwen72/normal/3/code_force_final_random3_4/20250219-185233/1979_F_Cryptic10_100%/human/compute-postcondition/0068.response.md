Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, the loop will continue to execute until `vx` has 2 elements left, and `ops` will be a list of tuples representing the operations performed.**

In natural language: The list `p1` now contains the same elements as `vx`, and `p2` is initialized as an empty list. The loop will still continue to execute until `vx` has 2 elements left, and `ops` will still be a list of tuples representing the operations performed.
