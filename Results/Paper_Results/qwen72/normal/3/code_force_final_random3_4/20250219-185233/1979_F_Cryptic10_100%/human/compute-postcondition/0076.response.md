To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation.
2. `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` where the corresponding `v2` matched the last element of `p1` at the time of the operation.
3. `ops` remains unchanged.
4. `vx` has 2 elements left.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`p1[::-1]`**: This reverses the list `p1`.
2. **`p1[::-1] + p2`**: This concatenates the reversed `p1` with `p2`.
3. **`map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)`**: This converts each element in the concatenated list to a string.
4. **`' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**: This joins the string representations of the elements with a space.
5. **`'! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**: This formats the string to start with an exclamation mark followed by the joined string.

### Example to Illustrate:
Let's assume:
- `vx` initially had elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- `ops` is a list of operations, each a tuple `(v1, v2)`, for example: `[(10, 5), (20, 4), (30, 5), (40, 3)]`.

#### Building `p1` and `p2`:
- Initially, `p1` contains the first two elements of `vx`, so `p1 = [1, 2]`.
- For each operation in `ops`:
  - `(10, 5)`: `5` does not match the last element of `p1` (which is `2`), so `10` is added to `p1`. Now `p1 = [1, 2, 10]`.
  - `(20, 4)`: `4` does not match the last element of `p1` (which is `10`), so `20` is added to `p1`. Now `p1 = [1, 2, 10, 20]`.
  - `(30, 5)`: `5` matches the last element of `p1` (which is `20`), so `30` is added to `p2`. Now `p2 = [30]`.
  - `(40, 3)`: `3` does not match the last element of `p1` (which is `20`), so `40` is added to `p1`. Now `p1 = [1, 2, 10, 20, 40]`.

#### Final State:
- `p1 = [1, 2, 10, 20, 40]`
- `p2 = [30]`
- `vx` has 2 elements left, which are `[4, 5]`.

#### Reversing and Concatenating:
- `p1[::-1]` reverses `p1` to `[40, 20, 10, 2, 1]`.
- `p1[::-1] + p2` concatenates to `[40, 20, 10, 2, 1, 30]`.

#### Joining and Formatting:
- `map(str, [40, 20, 10, 2, 1, 30])` converts each element to a string: `['40', '20', '10', '2', '1', '30']`.
- `' '.join(['40', '20', '10', '2', '1', '30'])` joins the strings with a space: `'40 20 10 2 1 30'`.
- `'! %s' % '40 20 10 2 1 30'` formats the string to start with an exclamation mark: `'! 40 20 10 2 1 30'`.

### Output:
Output: **! 40 20 10 2 1 30**
