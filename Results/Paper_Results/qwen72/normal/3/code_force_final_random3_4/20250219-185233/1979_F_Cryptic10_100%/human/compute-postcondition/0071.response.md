The only objects in the loop head are `v1`, `v2`, and the list `ops`. The loop iterates over the reversed `ops` list, so the next iteration will use the next tuple in the reversed list. For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must contain at least two tuples. At the end of the last iteration, `v1` and `v2` were the elements of the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list. For the next iteration, `v1` and `v2` will be the elements of the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list.

State: **`p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`; `p2` is a list containing `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`; `ops` must contain at least two tuples; `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list.**
