Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, the loop will continue to execute until `vx` has 2 elements left, and `ops` will be a list of tuples representing the operations performed.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`; `p2` is a list containing `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`; `ops` must contain at least one tuple; `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`; `p2` is a list containing `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`; `ops` must contain at least two tuples; `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list. If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, then `p1` has `v1` appended to it. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `p2` has `v1` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`; `p2` is a list containing `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`; `ops` must contain at least two tuples; `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the third tuple in the reversed `ops` list. If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, `p1` now contains one additional element `v1`. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, `p2` now contains one additional element `v1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
