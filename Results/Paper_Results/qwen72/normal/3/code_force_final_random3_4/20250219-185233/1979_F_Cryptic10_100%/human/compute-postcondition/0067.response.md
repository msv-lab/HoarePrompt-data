Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until `vx` has 2 elements left. At the end, `vx` will contain exactly 2 integers, `ops` will be a list of tuples representing the operations performed, and `p1` and `p2` will be lists of integers based on the conditions described.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop will keep running as long as `vx` has more than 2 elements.
- During each iteration, the loop removes one or two elements from `vx` depending on the value of `v2` returned by the function `q(len(vx) - 2)`.
- If `v2` is greater than 0, the loop removes `v1` from `vx` and adds the tuple `(v1, v2)` to `ops`.
- If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, the loop removes both `v1` and `v3` from `vx` and adds the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to `ops`.
- The lists `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the values of `v1` and `v2` in `ops`:
  - `p1` contains the initial 2 integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`.
  - `p2` contains all `v1` values from tuples in `ops` where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`.
- Once the loop finishes, `vx` will have exactly 2 integers left, and `ops` will contain all the tuples that were added during the loop's execution. The lists `p1` and `p2` will reflect the conditions described above.
