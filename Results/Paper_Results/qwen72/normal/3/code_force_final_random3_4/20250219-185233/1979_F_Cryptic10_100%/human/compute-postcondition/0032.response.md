Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing `v1`, `v1` and `v2` are the integers from the last tuple in `ops`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `v1` to `p2` if the last element of `p1` (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`.
- If `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `vx`, and `ops` remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` are not provided, but the logic of the code determines the updated state of `p1` and `p2`.
