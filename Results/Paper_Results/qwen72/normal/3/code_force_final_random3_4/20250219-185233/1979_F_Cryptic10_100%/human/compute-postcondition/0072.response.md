Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`; `p2` is a list containing `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`; `ops` must contain at least two tuples; `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list. If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, then `p1` has `v1` appended to it. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `p2` has `v1` appended to it.**
