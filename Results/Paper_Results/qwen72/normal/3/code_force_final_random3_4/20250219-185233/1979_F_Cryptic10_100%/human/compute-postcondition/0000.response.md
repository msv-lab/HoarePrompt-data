Output State: **A lambda function `q` is defined which, when called with an argument `d`, prints the query "? d" to the console and then reads and maps the input response to integers. The initial state of the function operating in an interactive environment with the specified constraints remains unchanged.**

The lambda function `q` is now available for making queries in the form "? d" and processing the response. The function can still make at most `n` queries, and the input constraints and the goal of finding a Hamiltonian path for each test case remain valid.
