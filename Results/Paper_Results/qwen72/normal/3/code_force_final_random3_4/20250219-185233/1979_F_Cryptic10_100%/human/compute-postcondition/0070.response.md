Output State: **`p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx` plus `v1` if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`; `p2` is a list containing `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`; `ops` must contain at least one tuple; `v1` and `v2` are the elements of the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `v1` to `p2` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`.
- If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- The values of `ops`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
- The initial state of `p1` and `p2` is updated based on the condition.
