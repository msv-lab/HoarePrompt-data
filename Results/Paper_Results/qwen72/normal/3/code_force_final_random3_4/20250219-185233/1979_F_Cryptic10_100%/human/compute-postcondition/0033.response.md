The only objects in the loop head are variables `v1` and `v2`, and the list `ops`. The loop iterates over the reversed list `ops`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the list `ops` must contain at least one more tuple, and `v1` and `v2` will be set to the values of the next tuple in the reversed list.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `int(input())` must be greater than 2.
- `_` is a throwaway variable.
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`.
- `ops` must contain at least one tuple.
- `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx`.
- `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing `v1`.
- `v1` and `v2` are the integers from the last tuple in `ops`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `ops` must contain at least two tuples (since the last tuple has already been processed).
- `v1` and `v2` will be set to the values of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 2, `_` is a throwaway variable, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to `int(input())`, `ops` must contain at least two tuples, `p1` is a list containing the 2 integers from `vx`, `p2` is an empty list if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise `p2` is a list containing `v1`, `v1` and `v2` are the integers from the second-to-last tuple in `ops`**
