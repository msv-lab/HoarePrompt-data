Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is a condition that must be met).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer, and `b` is greater than `a`.
   - The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
   - `2 * b` is twice the value of `b`.
   - `2 * b - n + 1` is the result of subtracting `n` from `2 * b` and then adding 1.
   - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n` multiplies the result by `n`.
   - `// 2` performs integer division by 2.
   - `int(...)` ensures the result is an integer (though `//` already performs integer division, `int` is redundant here).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The value printed will be the result of the expression `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Since `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the expression will always yield a valid integer.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2) (where b is the value of b, n is the value of n, and a is the value of a, with b > a and b - a >= n)**
