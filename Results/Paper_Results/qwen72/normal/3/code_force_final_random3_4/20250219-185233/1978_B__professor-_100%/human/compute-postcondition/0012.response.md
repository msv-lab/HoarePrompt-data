The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop increments the internal counter by 1 for each iteration, `t` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration to potentially execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made. If `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made. Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made.** 

However, to be precise about the next iteration, we should specify that `t` is now one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, but still greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 but one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made. If `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made. Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made.**
