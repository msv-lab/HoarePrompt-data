Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem by considering the different cases for the values of \(a\) and \(b\) and calculating the maximum profit accordingly. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case individually by reading the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\).

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If \(b \le a\), it is more profitable to sell all buns at the usual price \(a\). Therefore, the profit is \(n \times a\).
   - **Case 2**: If \(b - a \ge n\), it is more profitable to sell all buns at the modified prices. The profit in this case is the sum of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \(b\) and decreasing by 1 each time. This sum is given by the formula \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\).
   - **Case 3**: If \(b - a < n\), it is optimal to sell the first \(b - a\) buns at the modified prices and the remaining \(n - (b - a)\) buns at the usual price \(a\). The profit from the modified prices is the sum of the first \(b - a\) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \(b\) and decreasing by 1 each time, which is \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\). The profit from the remaining buns is \((n - (b - a)) \times a\).

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

The program correctly handles all the given constraints and edge cases, ensuring that the maximum profit is calculated accurately for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
