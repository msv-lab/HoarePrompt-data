Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 but one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made to `t`. If `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `t`. Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made to `t`.***
