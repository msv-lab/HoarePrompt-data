Let's break down the `print` statement step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `b` is greater than `a`.
   - The difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is: `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the difference `b - a`.
     - Let's denote this difference as `d`. So, `d = b - a`.
   - **Step 2:** Calculate the term `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`.
     - This is the sum of the first `d` natural numbers, which can be derived from the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
     - The formula is \(\frac{d \cdot (d + 1)}{2}\).
   - **Step 3:** Add `a * n` to the result from Step 2.
     - This gives us the final expression: \(\frac{d \cdot (d + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n\).
   - **Step 4:** Convert the result to an integer using the `int` function.
     - Since the result of the division is already an integer (due to the `//` operator), the `int` function will not change the value.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer value of the expression \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n\).

Given the initial state, the values of `b`, `a`, and `n` are not explicitly provided, but we know the relationships between them. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **\(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n\) (where \(b\) is greater than \(a\), and the difference \(b - a\) is less than \(n\))**
