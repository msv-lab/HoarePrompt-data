### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - Each test case reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage.
     - The profit in this case is `n * a`.
     - This is correctly handled by the program.

   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence `b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-n+1`.
     - The sum of the first `n` terms of this sequence is given by the formula \(\frac{n \cdot (2b - n + 1)}{2}\).
     - This is correctly handled by the program.

   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of the sequence `b, b-1, b-2, ..., a+1`.
     - The sum of this sequence is given by the formula \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is \((n - (b - a)) \cdot a\).
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts: \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot (n - (b - a))\).
     - This is correctly handled by the program.

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the profit for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. The logic and the formulas used are accurate and match the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
