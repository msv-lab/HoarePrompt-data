Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - **If `b <= a`:**
     - In this case, selling all buns at the usual price `a` is the best option because the modified price is not higher than the usual price.
     - The profit is `n * a`.
   - **If `b - a >= n`:**
     - Here, the difference between the modified price and the usual price is at least as large as the number of buns `n`.
     - It is optimal to sell all `n` buns at the modified price, starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent bun.
     - The profit is calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\).
   - **Otherwise:**
     - In this case, the optimal strategy is to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2}\).
     - The profit from the remaining buns is \((n - (b - a)) \cdot a\).
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

3. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
     - Since `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the optimal strategy is to sell the first `b - a = 1` bun at the modified price and the remaining `3` buns at the usual price.
     - Profit = \(5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17\).
     - The program calculates: \(\frac{(5 - 4) \cdot (5 - 4 + 1)}{2} + 4 \cdot 4 = 1 + 16 = 17\).
   - **Example 2:**
     - `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `b - a >= n`, the optimal strategy is to sell all `5` buns at the modified price.
     - Profit = \(9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35\).
     - The program calculates: \(\frac{(2 \cdot 9 - 5 + 1) \cdot 5}{2} = \frac{14 \cdot 5}{2} = 35\).
   - **Example 3:**
     - `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
     - Since `b <= a`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price.
     - Profit = \(10 \cdot 10 = 100\).
     - The program calculates: \(10 \cdot 10 = 100\).

4. **General Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the three main conditions: when `b <= a`, when `b - a >= n`, and when `b - a < n`.
   - The arithmetic calculations for the profit are accurate and match the problem's requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all the specified conditions and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
