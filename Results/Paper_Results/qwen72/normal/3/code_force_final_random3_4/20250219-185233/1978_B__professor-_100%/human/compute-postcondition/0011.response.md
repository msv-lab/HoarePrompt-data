Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made. If `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made. Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made.***
