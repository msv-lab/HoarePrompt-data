Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: n, a, and b, where n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if b <= a:
        print(n * a)
    elif b - a >= n:
        print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
    else:
        print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made. If `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made. Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 but one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made to `t`. If `b` is greater than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `t`. Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made to `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 but one less than it was at the start of the previous iteration, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided by the user. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no changes are made to `t`. If `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `t`. Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made to `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
