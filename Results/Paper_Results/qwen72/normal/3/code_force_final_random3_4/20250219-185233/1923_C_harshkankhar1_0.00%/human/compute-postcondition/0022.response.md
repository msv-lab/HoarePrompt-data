Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n`, `a` is the cumulative sum of its original values, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1` if the new `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` if the new `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2`, ..., `b[n]` is `b[n-1] + 1` if the new `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[n]` is `b[n-1] + 2, `q` is `q - 1`, `q` must be greater than 0.**
