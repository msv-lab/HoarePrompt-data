Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
