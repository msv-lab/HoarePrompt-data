Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function Call and Definition Order**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined. This will result in a `NameError` because the function is not recognized at the time of the call.

2. **Output of `a`**: The program prints the accumulated array `a` after computing it. This is unnecessary and not part of the problem's required output. The output should only contain the answers to the queries (YES or NO).

3. **Condition for Checking Good Subarray**: The condition used to determine if a subarray is good is not entirely correct. The program checks if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`. However, the correct condition should be:
   - The sum of the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` should be greater than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.
   - The subarray should have at least two elements (i.e., `x != y`).

   The program's condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` is incorrect because it should be `a[y] - a[x - 1] > b[y] - b[x - 1]` to ensure that the sum of the subarray in `c` is greater than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.

4. **Handling Single Element Subarrays**: The condition `x == y` is used to handle single-element subarrays, but this is not sufficient. A single-element subarray cannot be "good" because there is no way to replace the single element with a different positive integer that satisfies all conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import accumulate

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x == y:
            print('NO')
        elif a[y] - a[x - 1] > b[y] - b[x - 1]:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- The function `func_1` is defined before it is called.
- The unnecessary print statement for the accumulated array `a` is removed.
- The condition for checking if a subarray is good is correctly implemented.
- Single-element subarrays are correctly identified as not good.
