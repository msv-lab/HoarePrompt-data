### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it should take parameters to process the input as described in the problem. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads `n` and `q` from the input, which is correct.
   - It reads the array `a` and initializes `b` correctly.
   - The loop to compute `b` is also correct. It ensures that `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values that can be used to replace `a[i]` while satisfying the conditions.

3. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The cumulative sum of `a` is calculated using `accumulate`, which is correct.
   - However, the `print(*a)` statement is unnecessary and should be removed. It is not part of the required output.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - The function reads the queries and processes them correctly.
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` is used to determine if the subarray is good.
   - If the sum of the subarray `a[x:y]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b` or if the subarray has only one element (`x == y`), the subarray is not good, and the function prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element (`x == y`), which should always be 'NO' because there is no way to replace a single element with a different positive integer.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.

### Correctness:
- The function logic is correct, but the function definition should be updated to accept parameters.
- The `print(*a)` statement is unnecessary and should be removed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from itertools import accumulate

def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in c]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    
    for x, y in queries:
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')

# Main program to handle multiple test cases
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    c = list(map(int, input().split()))
    queries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(q)]
    func_1(1, n, q, c, queries)
```

### Final Correctness:
- **Correctness: **False****
- The program is almost correct, but the function definition and the unnecessary `print(*a)` statement need to be addressed. Once these are fixed, the program will be correct.
