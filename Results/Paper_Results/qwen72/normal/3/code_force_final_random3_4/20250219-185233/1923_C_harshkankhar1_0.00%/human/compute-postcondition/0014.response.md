To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `a` is the cumulative sum of its original values.
   - `x` is 1 if the new `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
   - `b[1]` is `b[0] + 1` if the new `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[1]` is `b[0] + 2`.
   - `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` if the new `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[2]` is `b[1] + 2`.
   - This pattern continues up to `b[n]`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of its original values. This means `a[0]` is the first value, `a[1]` is the sum of the first two values, `a[2]` is the sum of the first three values, and so on.
   - `x` is determined based on the value of `a[n]`. If `a[n]` is greater than 1, `x` is 1; otherwise, `x` is 2.
   - `b` is a list where each element is calculated based on the value of the corresponding element in `a`. Specifically, `b[i]` is `b[i-1] + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i-1] + 2`.

3. **Output of `print(*a)`:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
   - Since `a` is the cumulative sum of its original values, the elements of `a` will be the sums of the first `i` elements of the original list up to `n`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose the original list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - The cumulative sums would be:
     - `a[0] = 1`
     - `a[1] = 1 + 2 = 3`
     - `a[2] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
     - `a[3] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`
   - Therefore, `a` would be `[1, 3, 6, 10]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
   - The exact values of `a` depend on the original values, but they will be the cumulative sums of the original list up to `n`.

Output: **The cumulative sums of the original values in the list `a` up to `n` (where each element is the sum of the first `i` elements of the original list, and `i` ranges from 1 to `n`)**.
