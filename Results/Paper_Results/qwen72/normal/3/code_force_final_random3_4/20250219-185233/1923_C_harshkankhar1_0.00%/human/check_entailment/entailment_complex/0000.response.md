### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**:
   - The function `func_1` should take parameters to process the input, but in the given program, it is defined without any parameters. This is incorrect because the function needs to handle the input for each test case.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads `n` and `q` from the input.
   - It reads the array `c` and initializes an auxiliary array `b`.

3. **Auxiliary Array `b`**:
   - The auxiliary array `b` is used to store the cumulative sum of a modified version of `c`. The modification is such that each element of `c` is replaced by 1 if it is greater than 1, otherwise by 2. This is done to ensure that the sum of the modified array `b` is always less than or equal to the sum of the original array `c`.

4. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the cumulative sum of the original array `c` and stores it in `a`.

5. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(x, y)`, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `c[x:y]` is less than the corresponding sum in the auxiliary array `b` or if `x == y`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The condition `x == y` is correctly handled to ensure that a single-element subarray is not considered good.
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` ensures that the sum of the subarray `c[x:y]` is not less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.

7. **Output**:
   - The output format is correct, as it prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.

### Correctness:
- The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, but it is defined without parameters. This will cause an error because the function needs to process the input for each test case.
- The program should be modified to pass the necessary parameters to `func_1` and handle the input correctly for each test case.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` should take parameters to process the input for each test case. The current definition of `func_1` without parameters will lead to an error when the function is called in the loop.
