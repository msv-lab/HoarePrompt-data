Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`**. 

The value of `b[1]` is updated to be the sum of `b[0]` and `x`. The value of `x` is determined by the condition that if `a[1]` is greater than 1, `x` is 1; otherwise, `x` is 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
