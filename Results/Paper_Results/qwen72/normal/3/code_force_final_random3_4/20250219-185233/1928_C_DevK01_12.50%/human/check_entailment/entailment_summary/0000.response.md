### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific pattern: the first \( k \) positions are numbered \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \), the next \( k - 2 \) positions are numbered \( k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 \), and this pattern repeats.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), \( k \) must be such that \( x \) can appear in the settling pattern at position \( n \).
   - The position \( n \) can be expressed as \( n = m(2k - 2) + r \) where \( 0 \leq r < 2k - 2 \). The value of \( r \) determines the specific position within the repeating pattern.
   - The number \( x \) can appear at positions \( x \) and \( 2k - x \) within the repeating segment of length \( 2k - 2 \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even. If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with arguments \((y - 2) // 2\) and \( x \) to find all divisors of \((y - 2) // 2\) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It then checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and, if true, calls `func_1` again with arguments \((n - x) // 2\) and \( x \) to find additional divisors.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, converted to a set to remove duplicates, and the length of the set is printed as the answer.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` takes two arguments \( q \) and \( x \).
   - It initializes an empty list \( M \).
   - It calculates the square root of \( q \) and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). If so, it adds the square root to \( M \).
   - It iterates through all integers from 1 to \( \lfloor \sqrt{q} \rfloor \) and checks if they are divisors of \( q \). If they are, and if they or their corresponding quotients are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \), they are added to \( M \).
   - Finally, it returns the list \( M \).

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0, as \( y \) being odd implies no valid \( k \) can satisfy the conditions.
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \((y - 2) // 2\) and \((n - x) // 2\) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - The use of a set to remove duplicates ensures that each valid \( k \) is counted only once.
   - The logic for determining the valid \( k \) values is based on the correct mathematical properties of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided problem description and the execution summary. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
