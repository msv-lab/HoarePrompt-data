Postcondition: **`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`). If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the value 1. The current value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
