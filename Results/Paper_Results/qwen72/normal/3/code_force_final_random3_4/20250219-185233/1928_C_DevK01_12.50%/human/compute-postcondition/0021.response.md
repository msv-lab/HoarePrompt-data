The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3. If `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), `M` already includes the value 1, and possibly `q // i` depending on the conditions. If `q` is not divisible by `i`, `M` is a list that includes the values 1 and 2. After appending `i` (which is 3), the list `M` will include the value 3 in addition to its previous contents.

Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `M` is a list that includes the values 1, 2, and 3 if `q` is not divisible by `i`, or a list that includes the values 1, `q // i`, and 3 if `q` is divisible by `i`.**
