Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided is intended to solve the problem of determining how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of a given number \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). However, the logic for checking if a number is a perfect square and adding it to the list \( M \) is incorrect.
   - The condition `if w == w // 1` is not the correct way to check if a number is a perfect square. Instead, it should be `if w == int(w)`.
   - The loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1))` should be `for i in range(1, int(w) + 1)` to include the integer part of the square root.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the loop `for _ in range(t)` is flawed. The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, and then it checks if `y % 2 != 0`. This is not the correct approach to determine the valid \( k \) values.
   - The condition `if n >= 3 * x - 2` is not necessary and does not align with the problem's constraints.
   - The use of `L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the periodic nature of the settling pattern.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to understand the periodic pattern of the settling. The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions. Therefore, for a given position \( n \) and number \( x \), we need to find all \( k \) such that \( n \) falls within the correct segment of the pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        if (n - 1) % period < k - 1 and (n - 1) % period >= x - 1:
            count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_ks(n, x))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Function `count_valid_ks`**:
   - This function iterates over all possible values of \( k \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - For each \( k \), it calculates the period \( 2k - 2 \).
   - It then checks if the position \( n - 1 \) (since positions are 1-indexed) falls within the correct segment of the pattern for the given \( k \) and \( x \).
   - If it does, it increments the count.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling the `count_valid_ks` function with the given \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It prints the result for each test case.

This corrected program should correctly determine the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case.
