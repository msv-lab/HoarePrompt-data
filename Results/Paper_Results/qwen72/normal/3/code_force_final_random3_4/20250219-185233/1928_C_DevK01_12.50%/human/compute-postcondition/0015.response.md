Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), and if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 1, `q // i`, and 2. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is a list that includes the values 1 and 2.**
