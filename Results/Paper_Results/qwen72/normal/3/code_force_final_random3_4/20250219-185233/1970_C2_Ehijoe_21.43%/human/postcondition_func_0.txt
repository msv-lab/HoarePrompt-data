The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `nodes` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree), `start` (an integer representing the starting node, where 1 <= start <= len(nodes)), and `parent` (an integer representing the parent node of the current node, or None if the current node has no parent). The function returns a list of distances from the starting node to its descendant nodes, excluding the parent node. If the starting node is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is its parent), the function returns a list containing the single element 0. Otherwise, it returns a list of distances, where each distance is incremented by 1 to account for the additional step from the starting node to its children.
