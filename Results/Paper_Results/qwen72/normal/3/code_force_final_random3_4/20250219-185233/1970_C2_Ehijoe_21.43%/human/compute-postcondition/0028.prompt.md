Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers that are connected to the key. Each connection is bidirectional. The `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `empty` is True, `leaves` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers that are connected to the key, `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque. If the length of the list associated with `key` (which is 1) in `nodes` is 1, then `leaves` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `leaves` remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers connected to the key, `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `empty` is True, and `leaves` is a deque. If the length of the list associated with `key` (which is `n - 1`) in `nodes` is 1, then `leaves` contains the integer `n - 1`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers connected to the key, `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `empty` is True, `key` is `n`, and `leaves` is a deque. If the length of the list associated with `key` (which is `n`) in `nodes` is 1, then `leaves` contains the integer `n`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
