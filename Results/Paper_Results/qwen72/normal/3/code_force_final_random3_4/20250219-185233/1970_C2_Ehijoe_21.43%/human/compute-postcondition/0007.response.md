Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are input integers, `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as one of its elements, `nodes[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` adds the integer `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. The initial state specifies that `nodes[u]` already includes `v` as one of its elements, and the values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `nodes[v]` with `u` added to it, while all other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
