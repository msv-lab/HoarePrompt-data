Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers where 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and `t` is 1, but now `n` and `t` are updated to the values provided by the input. The edges list is still empty, `start` is an integer where 1 <= `start` <= `n`, `empty` is True, and `nodes` is a defaultdict with lists as default values.**
