Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is a list containing the integers that are connected to the key. Each connection is bidirectional, meaning if `u` is connected to `v`, then `u` will be in `nodes[v]` and `v` will be in `nodes[u]`. The `edges` list remains empty, `start` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `empty` is True.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be `n - 2`.
- The `nodes` dictionary will contain all the nodes from 1 to `n`, and each node will have a list of connected nodes.
- Each connection between nodes is bidirectional, so if node `u` is connected to node `v`, both `nodes[u]` and `nodes[v]` will include each other.
- The `edges` list and the `empty` variable remain unchanged, with `edges` still being an empty list and `empty` still being True.
- The `start` variable remains an integer between 1 and `n`.
