The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `j` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `cnt` is 0 or 1. If `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 or 1.**
