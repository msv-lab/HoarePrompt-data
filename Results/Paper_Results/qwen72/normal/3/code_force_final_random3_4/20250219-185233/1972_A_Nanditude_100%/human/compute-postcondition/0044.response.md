To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where \(1 \leq b_1 \leq b_2 \leq \ldots \leq b_n \leq 10^9\).
   - `_` is incremented by `n`.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b` or `n` if all elements in `a` are less than the corresponding elements in `b`.

2. **Understanding `cnt` and `i`:**
   - `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that satisfies this condition. If no such element exists, `i` is set to `n`.

3. **Example Logic:**
   - Let's say `a` is `[5, 10, 15]` and `b` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
   - We need to find the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
   - For `b[0] = 1`, the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 1 is `a[0] = 5`.
   - For `b[1] = 2`, the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 2 is `a[0] = 5`.
   - For `b[2] = 3`, the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 3 is `a[0] = 5`.
   - For `b[3] = 4`, the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 4 is `a[0] = 5`.
   - For `b[4] = 5`, the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 5 is `a[0] = 5`.
   - For `b[5] = 6`, the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 6 is `a[1] = 10`.
   - For `b[6] = 7`, the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 7 is `a[1] = 10`.
   - For `b[7] = 8`, the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 8 is `a[1] = 10`.
   - For `b[8] = 9`, the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 9 is `a[1] = 10`.
   - For `b[9] = 10`, the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to 10 is `a[1] = 10`.

   - The first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b` is `a[0] = 5` for the first 5 elements of `b` and `a[1] = 10` for the next 5 elements of `b`.
   - Therefore, `cnt` will be 5 (the number of elements in `b` that are less than 5).

4. **General Case:**
   - The value of `cnt` will be the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
   - This means `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the element in `a` at index `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`, which is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`)**
