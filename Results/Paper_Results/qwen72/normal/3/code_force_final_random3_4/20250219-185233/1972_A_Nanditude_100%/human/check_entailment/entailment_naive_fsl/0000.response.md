Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of new problems to be proposed is flawed. The program increments the count (`cnt`) only when `b[j] < a[i]` and then moves the index `i` forward when `b[j] >= a[i]`. However, this approach does not account for the fact that the most difficult problem is removed after each new problem is added and the array is sorted.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

The correct output should be `2`, but the provided program will output `1` because it does not correctly simulate the process of inserting a new problem, sorting the array, and removing the most difficult problem. The program simply counts the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a`, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the process of inserting a new problem, sorting the array, and removing the most difficult problem until all `a_i` are less than or equal to `b_i`.
