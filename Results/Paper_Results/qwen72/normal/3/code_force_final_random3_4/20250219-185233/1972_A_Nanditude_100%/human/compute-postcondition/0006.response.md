Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0.** 

The variable `i` is initialized to 0, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
