Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `cnt` is 0.**

The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged and retain their initial values and properties.
