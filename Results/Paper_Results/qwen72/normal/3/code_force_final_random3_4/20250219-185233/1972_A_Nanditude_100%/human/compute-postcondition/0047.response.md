Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `_` is incremented by `n` and must be less than `t`, `j` is `n-1`, `cnt` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and this code snippet updates `a` to be a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `_`, `j`, `cnt`, `i`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their initial states remain unchanged.
