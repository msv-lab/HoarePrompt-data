Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9. If `b[j] < a[i]`, `i` remains 1, `j` remains 2, and `cnt` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `i` is updated to 2, `j` remains 2, and `cnt` is 0 or 1. If `b[j] < a[i-1]` after the update, `cnt` is 1 or 2; otherwise, `cnt` is 0 or 1.***
