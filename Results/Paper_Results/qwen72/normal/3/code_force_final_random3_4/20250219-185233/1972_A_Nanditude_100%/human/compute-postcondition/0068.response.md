The function `func` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9. `b` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. `t` and `n` are integers within specified ranges, and `a` and `b` are lists of `n` integers each, sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
