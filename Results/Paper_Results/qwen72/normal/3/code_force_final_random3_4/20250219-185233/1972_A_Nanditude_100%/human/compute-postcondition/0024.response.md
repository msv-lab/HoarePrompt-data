Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user and sorted in non-decreasing order where 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9, `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the elements in `b` or the length of `a` if all elements in `a` are less than the elements in `b`, `j` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1.** 

The value of `n` is now updated to the new input integer provided by the user, which must be greater than 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
