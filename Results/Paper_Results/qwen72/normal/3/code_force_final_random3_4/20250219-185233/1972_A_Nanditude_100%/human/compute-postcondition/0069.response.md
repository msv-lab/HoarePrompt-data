Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each, where both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then counts the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding element in `a` for each test case and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
