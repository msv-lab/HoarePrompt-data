The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is the new input integer
- `i` is `n-1`

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start from 1 (as per the loop definition `for i in range(1, n)`).

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>', `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`**
