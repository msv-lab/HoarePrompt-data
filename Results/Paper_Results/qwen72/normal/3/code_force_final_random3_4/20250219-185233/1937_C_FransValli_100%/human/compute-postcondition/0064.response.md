Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`n`**: An input integer greater than 0.
2. **`i`**: Initially set to `n-1`.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
4. **`arr`**: A list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'.
5. **`mini`**: The last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

### Print Statement:
```
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`maxi`**:
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution.
   - If no such `i` exists, `maxi` is 0.
   - This means `maxi` will be the largest value of `i` where `res` was '<', or 0 if `res` was never '<'.

2. **`arr`**:
   - `arr` is a list that contains all integers `i` for which `res` was '='.
   - If `res` was '<' at any point, the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<' will also be included in `arr`.
   - This means `arr` will contain all values of `i` where `res` was '=' and possibly the last value of `i` where `res` was '<'.

3. **`mini`**:
   - `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>'.
   - If no such element exists, `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
   - This means `mini` will be the last value in `arr` where `res` was '>', or the first value in `arr` if `res` was never '>'.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string `'!'`, followed by the value of `maxi` and the value of `mini`.

- **`maxi`**: The largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- **`mini`**: The last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi is the largest integer i for which res was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such i exists, and mini is the last element of arr that was compared and resulted in res being '>', or the first element of arr if no such element exists)**
