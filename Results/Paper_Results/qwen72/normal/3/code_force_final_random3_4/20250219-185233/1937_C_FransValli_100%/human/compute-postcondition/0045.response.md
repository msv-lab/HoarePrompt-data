Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the input integer.
- `i` will be `n-1` after the loop finishes, as the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`.
- `maxi` will be the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0.
- `arr` will contain all integers `i` for which `res` was '='. If `res` was '<' for any `i`, `arr` will be updated to contain only that last `i` where `res` was '<'. If `res` was never '<' and never '=', `arr` will remain [0].
