Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is [1], `res` is '<'.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is [0].
- The code snippet `arr = [i]` updates `arr` to contain the current value of `i`, which is 1.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged.
