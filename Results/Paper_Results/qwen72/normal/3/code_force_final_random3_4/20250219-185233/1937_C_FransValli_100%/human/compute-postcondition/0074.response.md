The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.**
