Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.***
