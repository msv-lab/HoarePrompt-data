The value of `maxi` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 3, so `maxi` is now 3. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string, `maxi` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string, `maxi` is 3.**
