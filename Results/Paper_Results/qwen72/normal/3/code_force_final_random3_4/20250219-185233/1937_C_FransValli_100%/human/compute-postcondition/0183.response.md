The loop head contains the variables `item` and `arr`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. The loop iterates over the elements of `arr` starting from the second element (index 1).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
- `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' and must have at least 2 elements.
- `mini` is 0.
- `item` is 0.
- `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`.
- `res` is the input string. If `res` is '>', `mini` is updated to 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `item` must be the next element in `arr` starting from index 1. Since `arr` must have at least 2 elements, the next element to be processed is `arr[1]`.

State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' and must have at least 2 elements, `mini` is 0, `item` is `arr[1]`, `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`, `res` is the input string. If `res` is '>', `mini` is updated to 0.**
