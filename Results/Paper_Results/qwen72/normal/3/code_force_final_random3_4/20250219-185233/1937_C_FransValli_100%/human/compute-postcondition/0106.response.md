Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[3]`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`. `res` is now the input value.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `i` is 3.
- The code snippet `arr = [i]` creates a new list `arr` with the value of `i`, which is 3.
- Therefore, the new value of `arr` is `[3]`.
- The other variables (`n`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
