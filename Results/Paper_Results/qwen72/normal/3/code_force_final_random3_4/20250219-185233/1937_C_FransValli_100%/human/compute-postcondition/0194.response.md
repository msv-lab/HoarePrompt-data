To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`n`**: This is the input integer.
2. **`i`**: This is `n-1`.
3. **`maxi`**: This is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
4. **`arr`**: This is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
5. **`mini`**: This is the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>'. If `res` is not '>', `mini` remains the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>'.
6. **`item`**: This is the last element in `arr`.
7. **`_`**: This is the number of iterations, which is `n-1`.
8. **`res`**: This is the final input string.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`maxi`**: This is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'. Since `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` will be the last value of `n-1` for which `res` was '<'.
2. **`mini`**: This is the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>'. If `res` is not '>', `mini` remains the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>'. The exact value of `mini` depends on the content of `arr` and the final value of `res`.
3. **`arr`**: This list contains all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'. The exact values in `arr` depend on the sequence of `res` values.

### Example Scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: If `res` was '<' at the last iteration, `maxi` will be `n-1` and `mini` will be the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>', or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' if no '>' was encountered.
- **Scenario 2**: If `res` was '=' or '>' at the last iteration, `maxi` will be the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', and `mini` will be the last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>', or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' if no '>' was encountered.

### General Output:

Given the initial state and the variables involved, the `print` statement will output the following:

- **`!`**: This is a literal string.
- **`maxi`**: The last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
- **`mini`**: The last value in `arr` for which `res` was '>', or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' if no '>' was encountered.

Since the exact values of `maxi` and `mini` depend on the sequence of `res` values, we can describe the output as:

Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi is the last value of i for which res was '<', and mini is the last value in arr for which res was '>', or the last value of i for which res was '<' if no '>' was encountered)**
