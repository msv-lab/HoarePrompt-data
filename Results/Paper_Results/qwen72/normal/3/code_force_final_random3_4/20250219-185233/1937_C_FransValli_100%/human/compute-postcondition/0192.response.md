Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' and must have at least 3 elements, `mini` is 0, `item` is `arr[2]`, `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '>', `mini` is updated to `arr[2]`.***
