The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', `arr` is [2]. If `res` is '=', `arr` is [2]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1].**
