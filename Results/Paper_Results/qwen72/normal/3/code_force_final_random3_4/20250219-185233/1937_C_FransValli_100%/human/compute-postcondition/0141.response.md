Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`, `res` is the input string, if `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1, otherwise `maxi` remains 0, `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>'**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to the input string provided.
- If the input string `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 1. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.
- `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>'.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `item`, and `_` are not affected by the code snippet.
