Precondition: **The function `func` is part of an interactive problem where the input is a sequence of test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). The hidden permutation p is a list of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR results, and must eventually output a pair of indices "! i j" such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
