Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[2]`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. `res` is now the input value.***
