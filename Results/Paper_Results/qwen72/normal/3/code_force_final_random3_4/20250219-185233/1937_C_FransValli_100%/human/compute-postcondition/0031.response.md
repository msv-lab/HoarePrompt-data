The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `maxi` is 0.
- `arr` is [1] if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is [0, 1]. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is updated to [0, 1] and `maxi` is 0. If `res` is not '=' or '<', then `arr` remains [0] and `maxi` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is [1] if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is [0, 1]. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [0, 1] and `maxi` is 0. If `res` is not '=' or '<', then `arr` remains [0] and `maxi` remains 0.**
