Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `res` is an input string.
  - If `res` is '<', `arr` is [2].
  - If `res` is '=', `arr` is [2].
  - Otherwise, `arr` is [1].

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`res` and `arr`**:
   - The value of `arr` depends on the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is '<' or '=', `arr` is [2].
   - Otherwise, `arr` is [1].

2. **`arr[0]`**:
   - If `res` is '<' or '=', `arr[0]` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `arr[0]` is 1.

3. **`maxi`**:
   - The variable `maxi` is not defined in the initial state. Since it is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, it is used in the print statement, so we will represent it as `maxi`.

4. **`i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.

### Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- A question mark (`?`).
- The value of `maxi` (which is unknown).
- The value of `arr[0]` (which is 2 if `res` is '<' or '=', and 1 otherwise).
- The value of `maxi` again (which is unknown).
- The value of `i` which is 3.

Since `maxi` is not defined, we will represent it as `maxi` in the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **? maxi 2 maxi 3 (if res is '<' or '=')**
Output: **? maxi 1 maxi 3 (if res is anything else)**
