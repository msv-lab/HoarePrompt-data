Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `arr` is a list containing a single element, which is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement starts with the string `'?'`.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists. Since the initial state does not provide any information about the loop or the value of `res`, we can only state that `maxi` is either 0 or some positive integer based on the loop execution.
   - `arr[0]` is the first element of the list `arr`, which is 0.
   - `maxi` is printed again, with the same value as described above.
   - `i` is 1, as given in the initial state.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi`, the value of `arr[0]` (which is 0), the value of `maxi` again, and the value of `i` (which is 1).

Output: **? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 1 (where [maxi] is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists)**
