Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `arr` is `[1]`, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = [i]` updates the value of `arr` to be a list containing the current value of `i`, which is 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
