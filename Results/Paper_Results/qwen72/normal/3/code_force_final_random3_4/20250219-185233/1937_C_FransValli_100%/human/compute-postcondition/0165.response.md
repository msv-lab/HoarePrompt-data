Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is an input string, and `arr` is [1, 2] if `res` is '<' or '=', otherwise `arr` is [1].**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `arr`. If `res` is '<' or '=', `arr` was initially [1], so after appending `i`, `arr` becomes [1, 2]. If `res` is not '<' or '=', `arr` remains [1] as it was not modified initially. The values of `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged.
