The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it interacts with an environment that has a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1. The function queries the environment to find two indices `maxi` and `mini` such that the bitwise XOR of `p[maxi]` and `p[mini]` is maximized. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the pair of indices `maxi` and `mini` for each test case, ensuring that the maximum possible XOR value is achieved. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
