Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `arr` is determined based on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`.
     - If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1]` and `maxi` is 0.
     - If `res` is not '=' or '<', then `arr` remains `[0]` and `maxi` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `maxi` is always 0.
   - `i` is always 2.
   - `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[1]`, so `arr[0]` is 1.
     - If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1]`, so `arr[0]` is 0.
     - If `res` is not '=' or '<', then `arr` is `[0]`, so `arr[0]` is 0.

4. **Output Based on `res` Value:**
   - If `res` is '<':
     - `arr` is `[1]`.
     - `arr[0]` is 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 1 0 2`.
   - If `res` is '=':
     - `arr` is `[0, 1]`.
     - `arr[0]` is 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 0 2`.
   - If `res` is not '=' or '<':
     - `arr` is `[0]`.
     - `arr[0]` is 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 0 2`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider all possible cases.
   - However, the output will be the same for both `res` being '=' and `res` not being '=' or '<' because `arr[0]` is 0 in both cases.

Output: **? 0 [arr[0]] 0 2 (where [arr[0]] is 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise [arr[0]] is 0)**
