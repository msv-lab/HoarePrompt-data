Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing at least four elements, `mini` is the third element of `arr`, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, and `res` is the new input string.** 

The value of `res` is updated to the new input string, but the states of the other variables remain unchanged.
