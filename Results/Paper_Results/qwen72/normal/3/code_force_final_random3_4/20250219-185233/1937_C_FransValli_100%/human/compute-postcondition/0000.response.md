The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will be assigned a value from 0 to `int(input()) - 1` during each iteration.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration**
