Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution.
   - `arr` is `[0]`.
   - `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with a question mark (`?`).
   - The next value is `maxi`, which is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution. However, since we don't have the loop execution details, we can only describe `maxi` based on the given information.
   - The next value is `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the list `arr`. Given that `arr` is `[0]`, `arr[0]` is 0.
   - The next value is `maxi` again.
   - The last value is `i`, which is 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The question mark (`?`) will be printed first.
   - `maxi` will be printed next. Since `maxi` is described as the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, and we don't have the loop details, we can only say that `maxi` is an integer that could be 1 or greater, depending on the loop execution.
   - `arr[0]` will be printed as 0.
   - `maxi` will be printed again.
   - `i` will be printed as 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 1 (where [maxi] is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution)**
