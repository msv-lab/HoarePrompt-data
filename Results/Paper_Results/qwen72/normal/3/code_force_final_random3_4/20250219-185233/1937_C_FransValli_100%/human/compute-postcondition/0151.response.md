To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range function will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` must start at 1 as per the loop definition. The other variables (`maxi`, `arr`, `mini`, `item`, `_`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
