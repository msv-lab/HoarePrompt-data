Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The function then calculates and prints a value `k` for each test case. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as `a + (b + c) // 3` and adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After all iterations, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the ones provided in the last test case, and `i` is `n-1`. **
