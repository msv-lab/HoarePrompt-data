Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and the remaining extroverts cannot be accommodated with the available universals. Specifically, the condition `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:` is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the universals in a different way.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 2 1
```
- There is 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 1 universal.
- The introvert will take 1 tent.
- The 2 extroverts need to be in a tent with 2 others, but the universal can only fill one spot in a tent.

The program will output:
```
-1
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
2
```
- 1 tent for the introvert.
- 1 tent for the 2 extroverts and the universal.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
