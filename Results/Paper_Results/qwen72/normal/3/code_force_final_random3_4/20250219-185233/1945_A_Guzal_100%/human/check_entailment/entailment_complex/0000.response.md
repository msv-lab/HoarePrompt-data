### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Introverts:**
   - Each introvert must have a tent to themselves. Therefore, the number of tents required for introverts is `a`.

3. **Extroverts:**
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. Therefore, the number of tents required for extroverts is `b // 3` (full tents) plus any remaining extroverts that need to be accommodated.

4. **Universals:**
   - Universals can be placed in any tent configuration. They can fill the remaining spots in tents with extroverts or form their own tents.

5. **Check for Impossibility:**
   - The function checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `b % 3`) can be accommodated with the available universals. If `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the extrovert tents, and the function prints `-1`.

6. **Tent Calculation:**
   - If the above condition is not met, the function calculates the total number of tents required. It adds the tents for introverts (`a`) and the tents for extroverts and universals (`(b + c) // 3`).
   - If there are any remaining people after forming the full tents, it adds an additional tent (`+1`).

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the case where it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.
- The calculation of the total number of tents is correct, considering both the full and partial tents needed.
- The logic for checking the impossibility condition is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
