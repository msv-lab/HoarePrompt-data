The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, if `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. If `(b + c) % 3 == 0`, then `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3`.**
