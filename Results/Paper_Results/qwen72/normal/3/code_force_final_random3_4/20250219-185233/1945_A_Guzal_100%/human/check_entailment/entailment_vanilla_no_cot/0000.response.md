Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program checks if `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts.
   - The correct approach should be to first allocate tents for introverts (each introvert needs a separate tent), then try to pair extroverts with universals or other extroverts, and finally, check if the remaining universals can be accommodated in the remaining tents.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Tents:**
   - The program calculates the number of tents as `k += a + (b + c) // 3` and then adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. This is not the correct way to determine the minimum number of tents.
   - The correct approach should be to first allocate tents for introverts, then try to pair extroverts with universals or other extroverts, and finally, allocate the remaining universals.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Each introvert needs a separate tent
        tents = a
        
        # Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with 2 others
        if b > c // 2:
            # If there are not enough universals to pair with extroverts, check if the remaining extroverts can be paired
            if b - c // 2 > (c % 2 + a) // 2:
                print(-1)
                continue
            else:
                # Use universals to pair with extroverts
                c -= 2 * (b - c // 2)
                tents += b
        else:
            # Use universals to pair with extroverts
            c -= 2 * b
            tents += b
        
        # Allocate remaining universals
        tents += (c + 2) // 3
        
        print(tents)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Introverts:**
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent, so we add `a` to the total number of tents.

2. **Extroverts:**
   - Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with 2 others. We first try to pair extroverts with universals.
   - If there are not enough universals to pair with all extroverts, we check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with each other or with the remaining introverts.
   - If it is impossible to pair the remaining extroverts, we print `-1` and continue to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, we add the number of tents needed for the extroverts to the total number of tents.

3. **Remaining Universals:**
   - The remaining universals can be accommodated in the minimum number of tents by dividing `c` by 3 and adding 1 if there is a remainder.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly as per the problem description.
