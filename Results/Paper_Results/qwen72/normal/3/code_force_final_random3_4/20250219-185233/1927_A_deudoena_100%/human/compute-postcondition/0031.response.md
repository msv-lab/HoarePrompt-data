Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is `len(s) - 2`, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the position of the first 'B' character in `s` (1-indexed), `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the character before the last character that was processed in the previous iteration. The last character in `s` is 'B' if the condition was met, otherwise it remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
