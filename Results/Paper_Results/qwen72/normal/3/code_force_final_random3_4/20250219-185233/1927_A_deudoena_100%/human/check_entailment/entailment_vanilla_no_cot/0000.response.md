Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in how it calculates the minimum length of the segment to be painted. Specifically, the calculation `ma - mi + 2` does not correctly determine the minimum segment length. The correct approach should be to find the first and last positions of the black cells and then calculate the length of the segment that includes these positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    first_black = s.find('B')
    last_black = s.rfind('B')
    return last_black - first_black + 1
```

Explanation:
- `s.find('B')` finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`.
- `s.rfind('B')` finds the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`.
- The length of the segment to be painted is `last_black - first_black + 1`.

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white for each test case.
