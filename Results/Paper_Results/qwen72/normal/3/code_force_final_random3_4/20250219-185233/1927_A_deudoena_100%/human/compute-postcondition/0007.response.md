Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' in each string, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is 1, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the first character of `s`, which is 'B'.**
