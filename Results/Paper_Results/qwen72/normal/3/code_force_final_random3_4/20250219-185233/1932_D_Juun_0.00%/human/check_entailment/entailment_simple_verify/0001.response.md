### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not take any parameters, which is a deviation from the expected behavior based on the annotated code. The annotated code suggests that `func_1` should take `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` as parameters, but the actual implementation reads these values directly from the input inside the function.

2. **Trump Suit Identification**:
   - The program correctly identifies the trump suit and separates the trump cards from the non-trump cards by appending the ranks of trump cards to the `trumps` list.

3. **Non-Trump Card Matching**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `suits` to keep track of the non-trump cards. It attempts to match each non-trump card with another non-trump card of the same suit, ensuring that the second card has a higher rank.
   - If a match is found, it appends the pair to the `answers` list and removes the suit from the dictionary.
   - This part of the program is logically sound and correctly handles the matching of non-trump cards.

4. **Handling Remaining Non-Trump Cards**:
   - If there are any non-trump cards left in the `suits` dictionary after processing all cards, the program attempts to match them with a trump card.
   - If a trump card is available, it appends the pair to the `answers` list.
   - If no trump card is available, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns, which is the correct behavior.
   - This part of the program is also logically sound and correctly handles the matching of remaining non-trump cards with trump cards.

5. **Handling Remaining Trump Cards**:
   - After processing all non-trump cards, the program sorts the remaining trump cards and prints pairs of them, ensuring that the first card in each pair has a higher rank than the second.
   - This is done using a while loop that pops the highest and lowest rank trump cards and prints them as pairs.
   - The sorting and pairing of trump cards is correct and ensures that the higher rank card always beats the lower rank card.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the pairs of cards in the correct format and handles the "IMPOSSIBLE" case appropriately.
   - The output is consistent with the problem description and the expected format.

### Issues:
- **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1` should take parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` as suggested in the annotated code. However, the actual implementation reads these values directly from the input inside the function. This deviation does not affect the correctness of the program but is a design issue.
- **Rank Comparison**: The program uses the `sorted` function to compare ranks, which is correct because the ranks are single characters and can be compared lexicographically.
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases where there are no non-trump cards left to match with trump cards and where there are no trump cards available to match with non-trump cards.

### Conclusion:
Despite the design issue with the function parameters, the program correctly handles the problem as described, including the edge cases and the required output format. Therefore, the program is correct in its functionality.

### Correctness:
**True**
