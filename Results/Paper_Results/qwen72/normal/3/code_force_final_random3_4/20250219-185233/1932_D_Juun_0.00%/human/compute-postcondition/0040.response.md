Postcondition: **`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value is not `None`. If `rank` is `None`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop, and `suit` remains the key of the first non-`None` value. If `rank` is not `None`, the program continues with `suit` and `rank` as they are. Additionally, `trumps` is an empty list.**
