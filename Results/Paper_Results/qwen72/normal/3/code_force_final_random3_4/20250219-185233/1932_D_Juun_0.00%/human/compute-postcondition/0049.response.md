Postcondition: ***`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value is not `None`. If `trumps` is not an empty list, `answers` is updated with a new string in the format `'rank suit trumpSuit trumpRank'`, where `rank` and `suit` are the next key-value pair in `suits` (if `rank` was `None`, regardless of the value of `rank`, otherwise where `rank` is not `None`), and `trump` is the next value from the `trumps` list. The `trumps` list is now one element shorter, and the `suits` dictionary remains unchanged. If `trumps` is an empty list, the program returns without any value.***
