Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), and all elements in `answers` have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `suits` dictionary remains unchanged from its initial state, the `trumps` list is still empty, and all the strings in the `answers` list have been printed to the console. The `answers` list itself is not modified by the loop, so it still contains all the original strings, but each string has been processed (printed) by the loop.
