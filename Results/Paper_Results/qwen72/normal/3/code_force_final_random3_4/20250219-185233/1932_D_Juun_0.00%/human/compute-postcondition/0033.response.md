Output State: **The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards whose suits match `trump`. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to `None` for all suits that have been processed in the loop.**

Explanation:
- `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
- `trump` is assigned the value of user input and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `trumps` is a list that accumulates the ranks of cards whose suits match `trump`.
- `answers` is a list that accumulates strings for pairs of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit.
- `suits` is a dictionary that keeps track of the ranks of cards for each suit. Once a suit has been processed (i.e., a pair of cards with the same suit has been found and added to `answers`), the value for that suit in `suits` is set to `None`.
