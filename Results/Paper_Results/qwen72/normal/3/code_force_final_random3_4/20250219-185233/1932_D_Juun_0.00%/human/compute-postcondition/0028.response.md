Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, and `card` remain unchanged; `rank` is the rank of the next card in the list, `suit` is the suit of the next card in the list, `answers` has a new element appended which is a string formed by joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` appended to each, separated by a space.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the `answers` list.
- The new element is a string created by joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, with `suit` appended to each element in the list.
- The values of `n`, `trump_suit`, `cards`, `card`, `rank`, and `suit` remain unchanged.
- The `answers` list is updated with the new string element.
