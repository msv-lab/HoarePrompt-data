Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

In this case, the `return` statement does not specify any value or variable to return, so the program simply ends execution without returning any specific value. The state of the variables `suits`, `rank`, `suit`, and `trumps` remains unchanged, but since no values are returned, there is no output state to describe beyond the fact that the program does not return anything.
