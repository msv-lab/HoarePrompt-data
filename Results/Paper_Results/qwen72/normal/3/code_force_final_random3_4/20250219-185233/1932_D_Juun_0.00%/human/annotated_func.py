#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character trump_suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n strings cards, where each string is a two-character card description (first character is the rank '2'-'9', second character is the suit 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and all cards are unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards whose suits match `trump`. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to `None` for all suits that have been processed in the loop.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is an empty list or contains the remaining elements that were not used. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit. If `trumps` became empty before all non-`None` values in `suits` were processed, the program returned 'IMPOSSIBLE' and did not complete all iterations.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed. `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order followed by their suit.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values that were not `None` at the start have been processed, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards with the same suit (but not `trump`), and all elements in `answers` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a set of card descriptions provided by the user, where the cards are represented as a list of 2n unique two-character strings (each string consists of a rank '2'-'9' and a suit 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). The function also takes a trump suit as input. It pairs cards of the same suit (excluding the trump suit) and prints these pairs with the ranks sorted. If there are any remaining trump cards, it pairs them and prints them. If the function runs out of trump cards before all non-trump pairs are processed, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. The function does not return any value.
