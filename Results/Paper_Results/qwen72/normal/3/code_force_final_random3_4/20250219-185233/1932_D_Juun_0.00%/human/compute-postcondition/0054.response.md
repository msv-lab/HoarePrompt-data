Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'.
- At least one more value in `suits` is not `None` (excluding the one already processed).
- `trumps` is a list that is one element shorter than the number of keys in `suits`.
- `answers` is updated with a new string in the format `'rank suit trumpSuit trumpRank'`.
- If `rank` is `None`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as normal.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('IMPOSSIBLE')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is a simple string literal `'IMPOSSIBLE'`.
- The initial state provides context about the variables and objects, but it does not influence the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'` regardless of the values of `suits`, `trumps`, or `answers`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
