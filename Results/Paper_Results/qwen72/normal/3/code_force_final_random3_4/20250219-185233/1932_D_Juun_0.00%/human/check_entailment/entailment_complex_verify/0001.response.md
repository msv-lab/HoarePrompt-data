### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one. The function `func_1` is called for each test case, which is a good approach to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Trump Suit Identification**: The program correctly identifies the trump suit and separates the trump cards from the non-trump cards. This is done by checking if the suit of each card matches the trump suit and appending the rank to the `trumps` list if it does.

3. **Non-Trump Card Matching**: The program uses a dictionary `suits` to keep track of the non-trump cards. It attempts to match each non-trump card with another non-trump card of the same suit, ensuring that the second card has a higher rank. If a match is found, it appends the pair to the `answers` list and removes the suit from the dictionary. This part of the logic is correct.

4. **Handling Remaining Non-Trump Cards**: If there are any non-trump cards left in the `suits` dictionary after processing all cards, the program attempts to match them with a trump card. If a trump card is available, it appends the pair to the `answers` list. If no trump card is available, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns, which is the correct behavior. This part of the logic is also correct.

5. **Handling Remaining Trump Cards**: After processing all non-trump cards, the program sorts the remaining trump cards and prints pairs of them, ensuring that the first card in each pair has a higher rank than the second. This is done using a while loop that pops the highest and lowest rank trump cards and prints them as pairs. This part of the logic is correct.

6. **Output**: The program prints the pairs of cards in the correct format and handles the "IMPOSSIBLE" case appropriately. This part of the logic is correct.

### Issues:
- **Rank Comparison**: The program uses the `sorted` function to compare ranks, which is correct because the ranks are single characters and can be compared lexicographically.
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases where there are no non-trump cards left to match with trump cards and where there are no trump cards available to match with non-trump cards.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, which is a deviation from the annotated code's expectation. However, this is not a critical issue because the function reads the necessary inputs directly from the standard input. This is a minor design choice that does not affect the correctness of the program.
- **Card Pairing Logic**: The program ensures that non-trump cards are paired with higher-ranked cards of the same suit, and trump cards are used to beat any remaining non-trump cards. The logic for handling trump cards is also correct, as it pairs the highest and lowest remaining trump cards.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described, including the edge cases and the required output format. The minor deviation in function parameter handling does not impact the correctness of the solution. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
