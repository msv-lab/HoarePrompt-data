You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and n is an integer for each test case such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print('1 1')
        
        print('1 2')
        
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is `t - 1`. If `n` == 3, there are no changes to `t`, `i`, or `n`. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and `j` is set to `n` for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 50`. It then processes `t` test cases, each involving an integer `n` such that `2 <= n <= 10^3`. For each test case, the function prints the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and either `(2, 3)` if `n == 3` or `(2, 4)` followed by pairs `(j, j)` for `j` ranging from 4 to `n` if `n >= 4`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed and the corresponding pairs have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, specifically for values of `n` greater than 3. For `n = 4`, the program outputs the following points:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
```
However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, the points (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 4) result in the following Manhattan distances:
- |1-1| + |1-2| = 1
- |1-1| + |1-4| = 3
- |1-2| + |1-4| = 4
- |1-4| + |1-4| = 6

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is {1, 3, 4, 6}, which has 4 distinct distances. However, it is possible to achieve more distinct distances with a different arrangement. For example, the points (1, 1), (1, 3), (4, 3), and (4, 4) result in the following distances:
- |1-1| + |1-3| = 2
- |1-1| + |1-4| = 3
- |1-4| + |1-3| = 5
- |1-4| + |1-4| = 6
- |1-3| + |3-4| = 3
- |1-3| + |3-3| = 2
- |4-4| + |3-4| = 1
- |4-4| + |3-3| = 0

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}, which has 6 distinct distances, which is greater than 4. Therefore, the program does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
