You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and n is an integer for each test case such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print('1 1')
        
        print('1 2')
        
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is `t - 1`. If `n` == 3, there are no changes to `t`, `i`, or `n`. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, and `j` is set to `n` for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 50`. It then processes `t` test cases, each involving an integer `n` such that `2 <= n <= 10^3`. For each test case, the function prints the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and either `(2, 3)` if `n == 3` or `(2, 4)` followed by pairs `(j, j)` for `j` ranging from 4 to `n` if `n >= 4`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed and the corresponding pairs have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an integer `n` and need to choose `n` cells in an `n x n` grid to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.
   - The Manhattan distance between cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints a set of `n` points.
   - The points are printed in a specific pattern:
     - The first point is always \((1, 1)\).
     - The second point is always \((1, 2)\).
     - If `n == 3`, the third point is \((2, 3)\).
     - If `n > 3`, the third point is \((2, 4)\), and the remaining points are \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Pattern:**
   - For \(n = 2\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The Manhattan distances are \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\) and \(|1-1| + |2-1| = 1\).
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has size 2. This is correct.
   - For \(n = 3\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |2-3| = 1\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 3\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-3| = 2\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has size 4. This is correct.
   - For \(n > 3\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to `n`.
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |2-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
       - For points \((j, j)\) where \(j\) ranges from 4 to `n`, the distances between these points and the first three points will be:
         - \(|1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1)\)
         - \(|1-j| + |2-j| = 2j-3\)
         - \(|2-j| + |4-j| = 2j-6\)
       - The distances between the points \((j, j)\) themselves will be \(|j-k| + |j-k| = 2|j-k|\) for \(4 \le j, k \le n\).

4. **Checking the Distinctness:**
   - For \(n = 4\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\).
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |2-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
       - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
       - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
       - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has size 7. This is correct.
   - For \(n = 5\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\).
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |2-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
       - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
       - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
       - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-5| + |1-5| = 8\)
       - \(|1-5| + |2-5| = 7\)
       - \(|2-5| + |4-5| = 4\)
       - \(|4-5| + |4-5| = 2\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has size 9. This is correct.
   - For \(n = 6\):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\).
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
       - \(|1-1| + |2-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
       - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
       - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
       - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
       - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
       - \(|1-5| + |1-5| = 8\)
       - \(|1-5| + |2-5| = 7\)
       - \(|2-5| + |4-5| = 4\)
       - \(|4-5| + |4-5| = 2\)
       - \(|1-6| + |1-6| = 10\)
       - \(|1-6| + |2-6| = 9\)
       - \(|2-6| + |4-6| = 6\)
       - \(|4-6| + |4-6| = 4\)
       - \(|5-6| + |5-6| = 2\)
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), which has size 11. This is correct.

5. **General Case:**
   - For \(n > 3\), the pattern ensures that the distances between the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((j, j)\) for \(4 \le j \le n\) are distinct and cover a wide range of values.
   - The distances between \((j, j)\) points are also distinct and contribute to the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly generates points that maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given test cases.
   - The pattern used in the program ensures that the distances are distinct and cover a wide range, which is necessary to maximize the set.
