Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `j` is 6.

The print statement is:
```
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `j` is explicitly given as 6.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string and concatenates it with a space and another string representation of `j`.
3. Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string "6 6".

Output: **6 6**
