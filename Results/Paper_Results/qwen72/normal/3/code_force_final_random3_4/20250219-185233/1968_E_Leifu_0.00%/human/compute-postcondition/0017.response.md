The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 1. If `n` is 3, then `n` remains 3. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then `j` is set to `n`.**
