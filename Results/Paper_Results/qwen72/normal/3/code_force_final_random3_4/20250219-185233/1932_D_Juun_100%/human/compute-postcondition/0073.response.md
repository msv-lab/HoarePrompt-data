The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards`. 

- `n` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, representing the number of rounds.
- `trump_suit` is a character that can be 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S', representing the trump suit.
- `cards` is a list of 2n unique strings, where each string is a two-character card description. The first character of each string is the rank ('2' to '9'), and the second character is the suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S').

The function does not return any value in all cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept these parameters and perform some operations without returning any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a character `trump_suit` ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a list of 2n unique strings `cards` where each string is a two-character card description. The function does not return any value.**
