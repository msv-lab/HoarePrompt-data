Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `answers` contains one additional string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`. `trumps` has one less element. `suits` must have at least one more key-value pair where the value is not `None`. `suit` is the next suit in the `suits` dictionary, and `rank` is the next rank in the `suits` dictionary. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
