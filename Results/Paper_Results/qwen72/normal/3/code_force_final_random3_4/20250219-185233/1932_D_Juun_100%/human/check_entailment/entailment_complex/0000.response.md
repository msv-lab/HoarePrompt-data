Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them. However, it does not pass the necessary parameters to the function `func_1`. This is a critical issue because `func_1` expects to receive `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` as parameters, but they are not provided.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` as parameters to process each test case.

3. **Card Pairing Logic**:
   - The function correctly identifies trump cards and non-trump cards.
   - It attempts to pair non-trump cards of the same suit by sorting the ranks and appending the pairs to the `answers` list.
   - If a non-trump card cannot be paired with another non-trump card of the same suit, it tries to pair it with a trump card.
   - If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all non-trump cards, it correctly prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The function prints the pairs of cards in the correct format.
   - It also handles the case where there are remaining trump cards by pairing them with each other.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no non-trump cards that can be paired with each other.
   - It also correctly handles the case where there are not enough trump cards to pair with all non-trump cards.

However, the main issue is that the function `func_1` is not called with the correct parameters, which means the function will not work as intended when it is called.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not pass the necessary parameters to the function `func_1` and the function is defined without parameters. This will cause the function to fail when it tries to access `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards`, which are not provided.
