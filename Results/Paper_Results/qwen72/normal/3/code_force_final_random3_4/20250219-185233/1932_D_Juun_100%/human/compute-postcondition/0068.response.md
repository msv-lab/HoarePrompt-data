The only objects in the loop head are `answer` and `answers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `answers`. If `answers` has at least two strings, the loop can execute again for the second string. At the end of the last iteration, `answers` must contain at least one string, and `answer` is the first string in `answers`. For the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must have at least two strings, and `answer` will be the second string in `answers`.

State: **`answers` must contain at least two strings, `answer` is the second string in `answers`**
