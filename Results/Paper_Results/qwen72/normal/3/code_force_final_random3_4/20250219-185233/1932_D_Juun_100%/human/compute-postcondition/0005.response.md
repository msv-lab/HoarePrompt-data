The only object in the loop head is the variable `card`, which is derived from the input split by spaces. For the loop to execute, the input must provide at least one card. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input provides at least one card.

State: **The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The list `trumps` is now an empty list. The list `answers` is now an empty list. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None`. The input must provide at least one card, and `card` is the first card from the input.**
