Output State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged, `trump` is assigned the value of user input, `trumps` contains the ranks of all the cards that have the same suit as the `trump`, `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, `suits` must have at least one key-value pair where the value is not `None`, and the current value of `rank` is `None`. The `continue` statement has been executed, causing the loop to skip the rest of its body and move to the next iteration.**
