Postcondition: ***The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The variable `rank` is assigned the rank of the first card from the input, and the variable `suit` is assigned the suit of the first card from the input. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, the list `trumps` contains the rank of the first card, and the list `answers` is empty. Otherwise, the list `trumps` is empty, and the list `answers` is either empty or contains a single string which is the result of joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, and appending the `suit` to each element. The key `suit` in the dictionary `suits` is either `None` or set to `rank`.***
