The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `trumps`. If `trumps` is not an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `trumps` is now a sorted list in descending order and must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `trumps` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is now a sorted list in descending order and must contain at least one element. `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`. The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit.**
