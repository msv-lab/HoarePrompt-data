Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The list `trumps` is now an empty list. The list `answers` is now an empty list. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The variable `rank` is assigned the rank of the first card from the input, and the variable `suit` is assigned the suit of the first card from the input. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, the list `trumps` contains the rank of the first card, and the list `answers` is empty. Otherwise, the list `trumps` is empty, and the list `answers` is either empty or contains a single string which is the result of joining the sorted list of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space, and appending the `suit` to each element. The key `suit` in the dictionary `suits` is either `None` or set to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The variable `rank` is assigned the rank of the next card from the input, and the variable `suit` is assigned the suit of the next card from the input. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, the list `trumps` contains the new `rank` and, if the previous `suit` was also equal to `trump`, the rank of the first card. The list `answers` is empty. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, the list `trumps` remains empty. If `suits[suit]` was not `None`, the list `answers` now contains a single string which is the result of joining the sorted list of `suits[previous_suit]` and `rank` with a space, and appending the `previous_suit` to each element, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. If `suits[suit]` was `None`, the key `suit` in the dictionary `suits` is set to `rank`. If the previous `suit` was equal to `trump`, the list `trumps` contains the rank of the first card, and the list `answers` is empty. Otherwise, the list `trumps` is empty, and the list `answers` is either empty or contains a single string which is the result of joining the sorted list of `suits[previous_suit]` and `previous_rank` with a space, and appending the `previous_suit` to each element. The key `previous_suit` in the dictionary `suits` is either `None` or set to `previous_rank`. The list `input().split()` must have at least one more element, and `card` is the next element in this list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The variable `rank` is assigned the first character of `card`, and the variable `suit` is assigned the second character of `card`. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None`, except for the key `suit` which is set to `rank` if `suits[suit]` was `None`. The list `trumps` contains the rank of the first card if the previous `suit` was equal to `trump`, and if `suit` is equal to `trump`, it also contains the rank of the current card. The list `answers` is empty or contains a single string which is the result of joining the sorted list of `suits[previous_suit]` and `previous_rank` with a space, and appending `previous_suit` to each element. The key `previous_suit` in the dictionary `suits` is either `None` or set to `previous_rank`. The list `input().split()` must have at least one more element, and `card` is the next element in this list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
