Postcondition: ***`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. If `trumps` is not empty, `answers` contains one additional string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, `trumps` has one less element, `suits` must have at least one more key-value pair where the value is not `None`, `suit` is the next suit in the `suits` dictionary, and `rank` is the next rank in the `suits` dictionary. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.***
