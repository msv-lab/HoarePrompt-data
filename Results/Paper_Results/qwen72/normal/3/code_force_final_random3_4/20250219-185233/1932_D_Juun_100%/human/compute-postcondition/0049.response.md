Postcondition: ***`n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. If `trumps` is not an empty list, and if `rank` is `None`, `trump` is assigned the value of user input, `trumps` contains the ranks of all the cards that have the same suit as the `trump` except the last one, `answers` contains one additional string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, `suits` must have at least one more key-value pair where the value is not `None`, `suit` is the next suit in the `suits` dictionary, `rank` is the next rank in the `suits` dictionary, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `rank` is not `None`, the program state remains as described in the precondition. If `trumps` is an empty list, the program returns nothing.***
