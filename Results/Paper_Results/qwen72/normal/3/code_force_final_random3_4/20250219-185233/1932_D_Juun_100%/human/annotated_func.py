#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character trump_suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n strings cards, where each string is a two-character card description (first character is the rank '2' to '9', and the second character is the suit 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). All cards in the list are unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The function parameters `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of user input. The list `trumps` contains the ranks of all the cards that have the same suit as the `trump`. The list `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. The dictionary `suits` is initialized with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None` or to the rank of the last non-trump card of that suit encountered, if any.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is an empty list, meaning all the cards with the same suit as the `trump` have been popped out. `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`. The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit. If `trumps` becomes empty before all non-trump cards are processed, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and return, leaving some non-trump cards unpaired.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `n`, `trump_suit`, and `cards` remain unchanged. `trump` is assigned the value of user input. `trumps` is now an empty list. `answers` contains strings for each pair of non-trump cards of the same suit encountered, where each string is the result of joining the sorted ranks of the pair with a space and appending the suit to each element. Each non-trump card in `suits` that was not `None` has been paired with a trump card and added to `answers`. The `suits` dictionary retains the last non-trump card rank for each suit that was encountered, or remains `None` if no non-trump card was encountered for that suit.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: All strings in `answers` have been printed, and `answers` is now empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes user inputs for the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit `trump_suit`, and a list of 2n unique card descriptions. It processes these inputs to pair cards, printing pairs of non-trump cards of the same suit and pairs of non-trump cards with trump cards. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with all non-trump cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns. The function does not return any value and does not modify the original input parameters.
