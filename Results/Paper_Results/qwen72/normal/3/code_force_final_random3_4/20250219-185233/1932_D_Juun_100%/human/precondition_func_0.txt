The function should take three parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character trump_suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n strings cards, where each string is a two-character card description (first character is the rank '2' to '9', and the second character is the suit 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). All cards in the list are unique.
