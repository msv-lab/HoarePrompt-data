The only objects in the loop head are the list `answers` and the variable `answer`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `answers` must have at least one more element to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `answers` must contain at least two strings, and `answer` is the second string in `answers`.

For the loop to execute again, `answers` must contain at least three strings, and `answer` will be the third string in `answers`.

State: **`answers` must contain at least three strings, `answer` is the third string in `answers`**
