Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `a` is the third element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `x` is set to `a`, `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `y`, then `x` is set to `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is set to `n + 1`. `y` is set to `a`, `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` and less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`, otherwise `ans` is 3. `x == y` is True if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x == y` is False.***
