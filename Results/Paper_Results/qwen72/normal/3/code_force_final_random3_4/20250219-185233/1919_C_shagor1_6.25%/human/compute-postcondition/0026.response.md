Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `a` is the third element in the list `inp`, `x` is set to `a`, `y` is set to `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is set to `a`, `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` or if `a` is greater than `n + 1` and less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 1 if `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y` if `ans` is 1, `ans` is 2 if `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`.**
