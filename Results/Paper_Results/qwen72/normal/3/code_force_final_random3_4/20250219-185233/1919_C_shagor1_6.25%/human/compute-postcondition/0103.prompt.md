Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, and `ans` is 0. The loop will execute one more time if the input value `n` is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `a` is the first element in `inp`, `x` is `n + 1`, and `y` is `n + 1`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is 1. In all cases, `ans` is either 0 or 1, and `x` and `y` are updated accordingly based on the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t + 1` elements, `a` is the second element in `inp`, `x` is `n + 1` or the value of the first element in `inp` (whichever is smaller), `y` is `n + 1` or the value of the first element in `inp` (whichever is larger), and `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `a` ≤ `x`, then `x` is the second element in `inp`. Otherwise, if `a` ≤ `y`, then `y` is the second element in `inp` and `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `a` > `y`, then `y` is the second element in `inp` and `ans` is either 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t + 1` elements, `a` is the third element in `inp`, `x` is `n + 1` or the value of the first element in `inp` (whichever is smaller), and `y` is `n + 1` or the value of the first element in `inp` (whichever is larger). If `a` ≤ `x`, then `x` is the third element in `inp`. If `a` > `x` and `a` ≤ `y`, then `y` is the third element in `inp` and `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `a` > `y`, then `y` is the third element in `inp` and `ans` is either 1 or 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
