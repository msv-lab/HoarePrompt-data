Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` if it exists and is different from `x`, otherwise `y` is the smallest element in `inp`. `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer.
- **`inp`**: The list of integers must have at least `t` elements for the loop to execute `t` times.
- **`x`**: After the loop completes, `x` will be the smallest element in the list `inp`.
- **`y`**: After the loop completes, `y` will be the second smallest element in the list `inp`, provided that it is different from `x`. If all elements in `inp` are the same, `y` will be the same as `x`.
- **`ans`**: This variable counts the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`. If `x` and `y` are the same, `ans` will count the number of elements greater than `x`.
