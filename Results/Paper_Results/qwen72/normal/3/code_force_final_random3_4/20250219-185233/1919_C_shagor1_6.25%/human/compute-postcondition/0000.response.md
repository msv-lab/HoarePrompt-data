The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is derived from the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input provided to `int(input())` must be a positive integer, as this will determine the number of iterations the loop will run. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and should be the input that controls the loop. Therefore, `t` must be a positive integer to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
