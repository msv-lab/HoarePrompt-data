Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t + 1` elements, `x` is `n + 1`, `a` is the second element in `inp`, `y` is set to the second element in `inp`, and `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.***
