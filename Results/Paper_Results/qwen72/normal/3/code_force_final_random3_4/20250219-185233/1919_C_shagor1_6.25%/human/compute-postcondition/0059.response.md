Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t + 1` elements, `x` is `n + 1`, `a` is the second element in `inp`, and `ans` is 0. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `y` remains `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is 1.***
