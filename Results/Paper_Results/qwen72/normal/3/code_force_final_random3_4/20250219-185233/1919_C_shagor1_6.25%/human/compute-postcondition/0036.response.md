Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least `t` elements, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` if it exists and is different from `x`, otherwise `y` is the smallest element in `inp`. `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**
