Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `a` is the second element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `x` is set to `a` and `y` is set to `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is set to `a`. In this case, `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `n + 1` and less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`, `ans` is 1 and `x` is not equal to `y`. If `a` is greater than `n + 1` and greater than `y`, `ans` is 2.***
