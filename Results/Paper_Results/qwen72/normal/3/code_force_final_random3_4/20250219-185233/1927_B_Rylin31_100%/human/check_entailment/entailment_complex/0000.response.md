### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The list `s` is initialized to a list of zeros of length `l`. This list will keep track of the number of times each character has been used so far.

3. **String Construction:**
   - The function iterates over each element `j` in the trace array `array`.
   - It constructs the string `ans` by appending the character corresponding to the current count of `s[j]` plus 97 (the ASCII value of 'a').
   - After appending the character, it increments the count in `s[j]` to reflect that the character has been used.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `l` is 1 by correctly outputting a single character string.
   - It also handles the case where the trace array is all zeros by outputting a string of the same character repeated `l` times.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly maps the trace array to a string by ensuring that the character at each position in the string corresponds to the number of times it has been used before.
   - The use of `chr(s[j] + 97)` ensures that the characters are within the range of lowercase Latin letters 'a' to 'z'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a string from its trace array as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
