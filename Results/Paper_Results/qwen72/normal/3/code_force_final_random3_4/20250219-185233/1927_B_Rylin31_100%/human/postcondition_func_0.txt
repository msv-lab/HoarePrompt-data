The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and a list of integers `array` from the input. It then constructs a string `ans` by mapping each integer in `array` to a character in the alphabet (starting from 'a') based on the current count in a list `s` of length `l`. After processing all integers in `array`, it prints the resulting string `ans`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
