Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the `t` test cases, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of the elements in `s` at the indices specified by `array` plus 97, concatenated in the order the indices appear in `array`. After all iterations, `i` has reached the value of `t`, and all test cases have been processed, with the final `ans` string printed for each test case.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all `t` iterations.
- For each iteration, the integer `l` was read as input, and a list `s` of length `l` was initialized with all elements set to 0.
- A list of integers `array` was read as input for each test case.
- The string `ans` was constructed by converting the elements of `s` at the indices specified by `array` to characters using the ASCII table (starting from 'a' which is ASCII 97), and these characters were concatenated in the order they appear in `array`.
- After processing each test case, the string `ans` was printed.
- The variable `i` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
