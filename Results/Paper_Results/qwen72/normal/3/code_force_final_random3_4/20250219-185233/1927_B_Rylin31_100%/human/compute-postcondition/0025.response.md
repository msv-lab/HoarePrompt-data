The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` updates the string `ans` by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.

Let's break down the impact of the code on the program:

1. **`ans`**: The string `ans` is updated by appending a new character. The new character is determined by `chr(s[j] + 97)`.
2. **`s[j]`**: The value of `s[j]` is 1 (as per the initial state).
3. **`j`**: The value of `j` is the second element of `array`.
4. **`s[j] + 97`**: Since `s[j]` is 1, `s[j] + 97` is `1 + 97`, which equals 98.
5. **`chr(98)`**: The character corresponding to ASCII value 98 is 'b'.
6. **`ans`**: The string `ans` is updated by appending the character 'b'.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- For each test case, a valid string s exists
- `l` is an input integer greater than 0
- `s` is a list of length `l` where all elements are 0 except `s[j]` which is 1
- `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least two elements
- `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`, and now it also contains the character 'b'
- `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`
- `j` is the second element of `array`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where all elements are 0 except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least two elements, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` and now also contains the character 'b', `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`, `j` is the second element of `array`.**
