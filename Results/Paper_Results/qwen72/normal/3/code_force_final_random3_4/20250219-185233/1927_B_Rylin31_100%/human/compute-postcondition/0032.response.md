The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input value from `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the input value. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by the length of `array`. For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where all elements are 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to the elements in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by the length of `array`, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`**

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by the length of `array` from the previous iteration.
- The input value must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is incremented by the length of `array`, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`**
