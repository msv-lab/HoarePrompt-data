To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable is the loop iterator. It starts from 0 and goes up to `n`.
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable defines the range of the loop. The loop will execute `n + 1` times if `n` is a non-negative integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `i` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3 (relevant to the loop head).
- `w` is a list of integers (not relevant to the loop head).
- `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1` (not relevant to the loop head).
- `j` is `n-1` (relevant to the loop head, but needs to be adjusted).
- `eta` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop head).

For the loop to execute, `j` must start from 0, and `n` must be a non-negative integer. Since `n` is already given to be greater than or equal to 3, it is sufficient for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to start from 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list**.
