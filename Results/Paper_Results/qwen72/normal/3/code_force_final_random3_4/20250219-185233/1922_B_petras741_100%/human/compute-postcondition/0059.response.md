Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 2**.

The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[1]]` by 1, because `j` is 2, and `w[1]` is the element at index 1 of the list `w`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `q[w[0]]` is still incremented by 1, and `q[w[1]]` is now incremented by 2.
