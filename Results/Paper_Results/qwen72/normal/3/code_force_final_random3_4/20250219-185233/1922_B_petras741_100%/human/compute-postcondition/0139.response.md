To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `res` step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `j` is `eta_ln - 1`.
2. `eta_ln` must be greater than 0.
3. `n` remains unchanged.
4. `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0.
5. `rho` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]]` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`.
6. `res` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) * (q[eta[i]] - 2) // 6` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` plus the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of q[eta[j]] for all j from 0 to i)` for all `i` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **`eta` List Construction**:
   - `eta` is a list of indices where `q[j]` is greater than 0. This means `eta` contains only the indices of non-zero elements in `q`.

2. **`rho` Calculation**:
   - `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[i]]` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`.
   - This means `rho` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `q`.

3. **`res` Calculation**:
   - `res` has two parts:
     1. The first part is the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) * (q[eta[i]] - 2) // 6` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`.
        - This part calculates the number of ways to choose 3 elements from each non-zero element in `q`.
     2. The second part is the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of q[eta[j]] for all j from 0 to i)` for all `i` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.
        - This part calculates the number of ways to choose 2 elements from each non-zero element in `q` and then multiplies it by the sum of all previous non-zero elements in `q`.

### Explanation:
- The first part of `res` is a combinatorial calculation for choosing 3 elements from each non-zero element in `q`.
- The second part of `res` is a combinatorial calculation for choosing 2 elements from each non-zero element in `q` and then multiplying it by the sum of all previous non-zero elements in `q`.

Since the exact values of `q` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, we can describe the value of `res` based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **res (where res is the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) * (q[eta[i]] - 2) // 6` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` plus the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of q[eta[j]] for all j from 0 to i)` for all `i` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`)**
