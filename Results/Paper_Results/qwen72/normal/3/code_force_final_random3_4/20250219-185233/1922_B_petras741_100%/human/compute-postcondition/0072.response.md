Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n`. `eta` is a list that includes all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` is greater than 0**: This is the initial condition that allows the loop to run.
- **`j` is `n`**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`.
- **`eta` is a list that includes all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0**: The loop appends `j` to the list `eta` if `q[j]` is greater than 0. Therefore, after all iterations, `eta` will contain all the indices `j` for which `q[j]` is greater than 0.
