Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln`, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `j` for which `q[j]` > 0, for `j` in the range 0 to `n`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` in the range 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, `res` is undefined if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of all `q[eta[k]]` for `k` in the range 0 to `j-1`)` for all `j` in the range 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, `n` is less than 3 and no changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`. If `n` is less than 3, `n` is less than 3, and no changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is a list that includes all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `j` remains `n` and `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `j` is set to `eta_ln - 1`, `rho` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]]` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) * (q[eta[i]] - 2) // 6` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` plus the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of `q[eta[k]]` for all `k` from 0 to `i - 1` + `q[eta[i]])` for all `i` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`. If `n` is less than 3, no changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `j` remains `n` and `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `j` is set to `eta_ln - 1`, `rho` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]]` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) * (q[eta[i]] - 2) // 6` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` plus the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of `q[eta[k]]` for all `k` from 0 to `i - 1` + `q[eta[i]])` for all `i` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
