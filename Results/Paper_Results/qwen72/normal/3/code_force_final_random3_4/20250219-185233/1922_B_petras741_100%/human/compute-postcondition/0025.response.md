Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` with each `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, and `eta` is a list containing all the integers `j` for which `q[j]` > 0, for `j` in the range 0 to `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as an input integer between 1 and 10,000.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
- The list `w` remains unchanged as a list of integers.
- The list `q` remains a list of length `n + 1`, where each element `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `j` has reached the value `n`, which is the end of the loop's range.
- The list `eta` now contains all the indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) for which the corresponding element in `q` is greater than 0.
