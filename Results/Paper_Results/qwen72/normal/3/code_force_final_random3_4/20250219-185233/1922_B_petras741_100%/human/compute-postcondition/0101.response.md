To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `j` will start at 0 and iterate up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (this is not relevant to the loop head).
- `i` is 2 (this is not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `w` is a list of integers provided by the user (this is not relevant to the loop head).
- `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1` (this is not relevant to the loop head).

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` will start at 0.

State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
