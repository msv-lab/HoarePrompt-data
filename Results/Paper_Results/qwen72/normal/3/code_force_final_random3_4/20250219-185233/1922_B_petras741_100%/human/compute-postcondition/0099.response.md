The provided Python code snippet updates the list `w` by reading a space-separated sequence of integers from the user input. The initial state includes `t` as an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `i` as 2, `n` as a new input integer, `w` as a list of integers provided by the user, and `q` as a list of zeros of length `n + 1`. The conditions and calculations involving `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` are not affected by this code snippet, as they are not part of the snippet provided.

The code snippet `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` changes the value of `w` to a new list of integers based on the user input. The length of `w` will be the number of integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`. If `n` is less than 3, `n` is less than 3, and no changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is a list that includes all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `j` remains `n` and `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `j` is set to `eta_ln - 1`, `rho` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]]` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) * (q[eta[i]] - 2) // 6` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` plus the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of `q[eta[k]]` for all `k` from 0 to `i - 1` + `q[eta[i]])` for all `i` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.**
