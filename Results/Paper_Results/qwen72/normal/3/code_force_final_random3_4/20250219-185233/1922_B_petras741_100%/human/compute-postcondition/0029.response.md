Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is 0.
3. `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3.
4. `w` is a list of integers.
5. `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.
6. Each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`.
7. `j` is `n`.
8. `eta` is a list containing all the integers `j` for which `q[j]` > 0, for `j` in the range 0 to `n`.
9. `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.
10. `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`.
11. `eta_ln` is 1.

### Analysis:
- `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3.
- `w` is a list of integers, and `q` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.
- For each `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`, `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1. This means that `q` will have non-zero values at indices corresponding to the elements in `w`.
- `eta` is a list containing all the integers `j` for which `q[j]` > 0, for `j` in the range 0 to `n`. Since `eta_ln` is 1, there is exactly one unique element in `w` that appears at least once.
- `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, which means `rho` is the count of the unique element in `w`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

### Explanation:
- The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, which is a common formula for combinations: \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \).
- Since `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, the expression will always yield a non-negative integer.

### Final Output:
The code prints the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, which is calculated as \( \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \).

Output: **\(\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}\) (where \(n\) is the input integer and is greater than or equal to 3)**
