Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list that includes all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is equal to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is calculated using the expression `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.
- The value of `q[eta[0]]` is assigned to `rho`, so `rho` remains unchanged.
- The other variables (`n`, `j`, `eta`, `eta_ln`) are not affected by the code snippet.
- The initial conditions (`n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list of indices, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and `eta_ln` is not equal to 1) remain valid.
