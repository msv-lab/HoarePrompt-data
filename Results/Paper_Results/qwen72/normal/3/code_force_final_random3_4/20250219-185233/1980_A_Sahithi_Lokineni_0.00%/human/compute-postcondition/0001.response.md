The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each tuple, `1 <= n <= 50` and `1 <= m <= 5`. The function always returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts `t` (an integer) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'). It always returns 0.**
