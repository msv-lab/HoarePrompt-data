Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the string `s` does not contain all the required difficulty levels ('A' to 'G'). Specifically, the `default_value` function is not defined, which will cause a runtime error when the program tries to use it. Additionally, the program does not correctly account for the fact that each round requires one problem of each difficulty level. For example, if `s = "ABCDEF"` and `m = 1`, the program will incorrectly output `1` instead of `1` (since it is missing one 'G' problem).

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

This version correctly initializes the `defaultdict` with `int` and iterates over all required difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') to ensure that each round has one problem of each difficulty level.
