Reasoning:  
The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Default Value for `defaultdict`**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with `default_value`, which is not defined anywhere in the code. This will result in a `NameError` when the program runs. The correct initialization should be `defaultdict(int)` to set the default value to 0.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Minimum Number of Problems**: The logic in the program is incorrect. The program iterates over the keys in the dictionary `d` and checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`. This logic is flawed because it should be checking if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and adding `m - d[val]` to `ans` for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', not just the ones that are present in the input string.

3. **Handling All Difficulty Levels**: The program should account for all difficulty levels from 'A' to 'G', even if they are not present in the input string. The current logic only checks the difficulty levels that are present in the input string, which can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is not used in the program and is incorrectly defined. The problem does not require a function, and the function definition provided does not match the problem description.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
