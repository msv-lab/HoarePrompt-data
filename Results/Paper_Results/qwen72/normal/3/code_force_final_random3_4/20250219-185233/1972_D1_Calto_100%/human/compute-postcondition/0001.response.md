The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1, and `i` should start from 1. The variable `cnt` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, the initial state of `cnt` is -1, which is provided for context but does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
