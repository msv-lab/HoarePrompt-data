The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function calculates a value `cnt` by summing up a specific expression for each integer `j` from 1 to `m` (inclusive). The expression is `math.ceil((n - (j * j - j)) / (j * j)) + ((n - (j * j - j)) % (j * j) == 0)`. After summing these values, 1 is subtracted from the total sum, and the result is returned.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (j * j - j)) / (j * j)) + ((n - (j * j - j)) % (j * j) == 0)` for each `j` from 1 to `m`, minus 1.**
