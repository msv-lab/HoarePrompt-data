Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). 

### Issue:
- **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**: The function `func_2` attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs, but the logic used is incorrect. Specifically, the expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly represent the condition \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

### Counterexample:
- **Test Case**: \( n = 2 \), \( m = 3 \)
  - Expected Output: 3
  - Actual Output: 2

  **Explanation**:
  - The valid pairs are: (1, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3).
  - The program only counts (1, 1) and (2, 2), missing (2, 3).

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and therefore, it is incorrect.
