Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the functions and the logic:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. It is correct and can be used to find the GCD.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**
   - The function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the logic inside the function is flawed. Specifically, the expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not correctly represent the conditions of the problem.
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) should be checked for each pair \((a, b)\) within the given ranges, but the current logic does not do this.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition for each pair. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Reading input
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# Printing results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected program iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). It then counts and prints the number of valid pairs for each test case.
