### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the logic used in `func_2` is flawed.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **State Before `func_1` Call**: \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - **State After `func_1` Call**: The function returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\), which is correct.
   - **State Before `func_2` Call**: \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
   - **State After `func_2` Call**: The function returns `cnt`, which is calculated using the formula `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` for each \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(m\).

4. **Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` is used to calculate the number of valid pairs. However, this does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - For each \(i\) (which represents \(b\)), the program calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. The term `x / y` is then used to count the number of valid \(a\) values, but this does not align with the required condition.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - **Test Case**: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
     - **Expected Output**: 3
     - **Actual Output**: 2
     - **Explanation**:
       - The valid pairs are: (1, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3).
       - The program only counts (1, 1) and (2, 2), missing (2, 3).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The counterexample provided in the original assessment clearly shows that the program is not counting all valid pairs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
