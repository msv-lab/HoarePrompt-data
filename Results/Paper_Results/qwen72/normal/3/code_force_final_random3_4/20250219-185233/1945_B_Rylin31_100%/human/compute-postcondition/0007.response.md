The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.**
