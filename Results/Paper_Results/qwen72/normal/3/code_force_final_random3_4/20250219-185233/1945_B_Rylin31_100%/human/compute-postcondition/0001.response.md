The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 0, and `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0**
