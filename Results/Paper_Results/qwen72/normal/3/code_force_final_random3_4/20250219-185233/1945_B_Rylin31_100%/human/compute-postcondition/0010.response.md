Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains the same as it was initially, an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The variable `i` will be `t-1`, which means it has completed all iterations from 0 to `t-1`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` will still be input integers, but their specific values will be those provided in the last iteration of the loop.
