Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user.
- The condition (a < b < c) is false.
- The current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy the condition (a < b > c).

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'PEAK'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly used in the `print` statement, but the condition (a < b > c) being true is the context in which the `print` statement is executed.

Output: **PEAK**
