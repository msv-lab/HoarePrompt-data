Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers provided by the user. If `a` < `b` < `c`, the condition `a` < `b` < `c` is true. If `a` < `b` > `c`, the condition `a` < `b` > `c` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a` < `b` < `c` is true.***
