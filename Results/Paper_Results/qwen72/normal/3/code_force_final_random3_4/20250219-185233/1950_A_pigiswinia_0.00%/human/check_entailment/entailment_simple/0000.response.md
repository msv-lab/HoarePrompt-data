Reasoning:  
The program is almost correct, but there is a minor issue with the output strings. According to the problem description, the output should be "STAIR" (not "STAIRS") when the digits form a stair. The rest of the logic is correct: it correctly checks for the conditions of a stair and a peak, and outputs "NONE" for any other case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')  # Corrected from 'STAIRS' to 'STAIR'
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

Given the minor issue with the string output, the original program is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
