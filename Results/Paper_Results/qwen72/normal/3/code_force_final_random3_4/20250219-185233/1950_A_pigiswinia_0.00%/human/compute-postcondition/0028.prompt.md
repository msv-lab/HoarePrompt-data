You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called in a loop where the loop runs t times, with t being a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each iteration, the function should receive three digits a, b, c as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, and for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user. For each set of `a`, `b`, and `c` provided, if `a` < `b` < `c`, the output is 'STAIRS'. If `a` < `b` > `c`, the output is 'PEAK'. Otherwise, the output is 'NONE'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is called within a loop running `t` times (1 <= t <= 1000). For each iteration, it accepts three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9) as input and performs an operation with these digits, but does not return any value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
