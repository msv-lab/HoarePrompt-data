Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a non-negative integer provided by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user.
- The condition `(a < b < c)` is false.
- The condition `(a < b > c)` is also false.

Given these conditions, the only possible values for `a`, `b`, and `c` that satisfy both conditions are:
- `a == b` and `b == c` (i.e., `a == b == c`).
- `a == b` and `b < c` (i.e., `a == b < c`).
- `a == b` and `b > c` (i.e., `a == b > c`).
- `a < b` and `b == c` (i.e., `a < b == c`).
- `a > b` and `b == c` (i.e., `a > b == c`).

In all these cases, the conditions `(a < b < c)` and `(a < b > c)` are false. Therefore, the code snippet:

```python
print('NONE')
```

will simply print the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
