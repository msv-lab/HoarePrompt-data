The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'STAIRS'`. The initial state describes the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Output: **STAIRS**
