Correctness: **False**

The given program is almost correct, but there is a minor issue with the output for the "STAIR" condition. The program outputs "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR". This will cause the output to be incorrect according to the problem description, which specifies that the output should be "STAIR" (not "STAIRS").

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')  # Corrected from 'STAIRS' to 'STAIR'
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this correction, the program will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
