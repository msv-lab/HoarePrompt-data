The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of `t` tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element represents the number of operations required to ensure all elements in the corresponding heap (constructed from the sorted array starting from the median) are greater than the current median. The function modifies the input arrays by sorting them but does not alter the original `test_cases` list. After the function concludes, `t` remains a positive integer, `test_cases` is unchanged, and `results` contains the operation counts for each test case.
