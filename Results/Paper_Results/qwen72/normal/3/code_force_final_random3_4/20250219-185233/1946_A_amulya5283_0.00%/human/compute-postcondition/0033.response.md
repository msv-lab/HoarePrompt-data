Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` + 1 to the end, where all elements are greater than or equal to the next smallest element after `current_median`, `operations` is 0, `smallest` is the value of `current_median`.**
