You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of `t` tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` where each element represents the number of operations required to ensure all elements in the corresponding heap (constructed from the sorted array starting from the median) are greater than the current median. The function modifies the input arrays by sorting them but does not alter the original `test_cases` list. After the function concludes, `t` remains a positive integer, `test_cases` is unchanged, and `results` contains the operation counts for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach to handle multiple test cases.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the length `n` and the array `arr` for each test case and appending them to a list `test_cases`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted. This is necessary to find the median, as the median is defined as the middle element in the sorted array.

3. **Finding the Median Index**:
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct for arrays of odd length. For even-length arrays, the median is the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array, which is also correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is done to efficiently manage the elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.

5. **Incrementing Elements**:
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. This ensures that the median is increased by the minimum number of operations.
   - Each increment operation is counted, and the total number of operations is stored in the `results` list.

6. **Output**:
   - The results are printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of Median Calculation**:
  - The median index is correctly calculated as `n // 2` for both even and odd lengths of the array.
  - The program correctly identifies the current median and the elements that need to be incremented to increase the median.

- **Efficiency**:
  - Using a heap to manage the elements greater than or equal to the current median is efficient, especially for large arrays. The heap operations (push and pop) are O(log k), where k is the number of elements in the heap.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a single batch and processing each test case individually.

### Potential Issues:

- **Heap Initialization**:
  - The heap is initialized with elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is correct, but it might be more intuitive to initialize the heap with the entire array and then manage the median element directly.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program should handle edge cases such as arrays with a single element or arrays where all elements are the same. However, the provided test cases and the problem constraints suggest that these edge cases are covered.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. It handles the input and output as specified, and the use of a heap ensures efficient increment operations.

### Correctness:
**True**
