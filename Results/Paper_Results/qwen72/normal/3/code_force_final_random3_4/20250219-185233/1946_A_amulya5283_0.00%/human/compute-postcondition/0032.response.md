To determine if the loop can execute for the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of t tuples
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`
- `arr` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is now sorted in ascending order
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`
- `heap` is now a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are greater than or equal to `current_median`
- `operations` is 0

Let's break down the condition:
- `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the min-heap.
- `current_median` is the median value of the sorted `arr`.

Since `heap` is a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, and all elements in `heap` are greater than or equal to `current_median`, the smallest element in `heap` (i.e., `heap[0]`) must be at least `current_median`.

Given this, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` will always be true because `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap and is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `current_median`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are greater than or equal to `current_median`, `operations` is 0**
