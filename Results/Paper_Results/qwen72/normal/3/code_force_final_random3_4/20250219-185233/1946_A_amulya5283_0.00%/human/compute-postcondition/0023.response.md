The code snippet `results.append(operations)` adds the value of `operations` to the list `results`. The value of `operations` is the number of times the loop has executed, but since the initial state does not specify the value of `operations`, we assume it is a known value. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**
