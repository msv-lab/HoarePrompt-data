The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` into the heap `heap`. 

- `smallest` is the value at the index `median_index + 1` in `arr`.
- `heap` is a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index + 1` to the end.
- The value `smallest + 1` is added to the heap, which means the heap now contains one additional element.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in `arr`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index + 1` to the end, plus the value `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the value at the index `median_index + 1` in `arr`.**
