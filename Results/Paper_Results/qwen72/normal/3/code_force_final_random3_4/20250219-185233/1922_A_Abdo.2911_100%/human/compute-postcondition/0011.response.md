Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`, the character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `a`, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
