The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is typically used when the loop variable is not needed inside the loop body. Before the loop starts, `t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0**
