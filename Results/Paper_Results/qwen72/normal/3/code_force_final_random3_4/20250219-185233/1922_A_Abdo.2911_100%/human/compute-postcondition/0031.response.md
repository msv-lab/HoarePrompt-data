Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, `possible` is True.** 

The variable `possible` is set to `True`, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i` still holds.
