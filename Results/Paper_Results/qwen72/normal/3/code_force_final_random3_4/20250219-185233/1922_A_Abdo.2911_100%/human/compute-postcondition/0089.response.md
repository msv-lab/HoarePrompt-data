The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be an integer between 1 and 1000 for the loop to continue.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, and `possible` retains its initial value.**
