Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an input integer greater than 0, a, b, and c are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, i is n-1. If `possible` is True, it means that at least one of the following conditions has been met during the loop execution: (1) a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or (2) a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]. If `possible` is False, none of these conditions have been met during the loop execution.**
