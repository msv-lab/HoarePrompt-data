Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` is the last index of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- `possible` is True, indicating that at least one of the following conditions has been met during the loop execution:
  - (1) `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`
  - (2) `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i] != b[i]`

Given that `possible` is True, the print statement will execute and print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
