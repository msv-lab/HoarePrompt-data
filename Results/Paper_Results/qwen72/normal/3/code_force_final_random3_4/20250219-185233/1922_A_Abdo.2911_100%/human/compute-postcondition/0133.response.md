Output State: **_ is t-1, t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an input integer greater than 0, a, b, and c are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, i is n-1. If `possible` is True, it means that at least one of the following conditions has been met during the loop execution for any of the test cases: (1) a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or (2) a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]. If `possible` is False, none of these conditions have been met during the loop execution for any of the test cases.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has run `t` times, and the loop variable `_` is now `t-1`.
- The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- The index `i` is `n-1` for the last test case.
- The variable `possible` is either True or False depending on the conditions checked within the loop for each test case. If `possible` is True, it indicates that for at least one test case, one of the following conditions was met:
  - There exists at least one index `i` where `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`.
  - There exists at least one index `i` where `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i] != b[i]`.
- If `possible` is False, it means that for all test cases, none of these conditions were met.
