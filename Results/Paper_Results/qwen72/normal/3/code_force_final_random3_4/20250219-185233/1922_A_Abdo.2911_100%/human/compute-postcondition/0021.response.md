The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings and are not modified in the loop head. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `i` and the condition that `i` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (unchanged in the loop head).
- `_` is 0 (unchanged in the loop head).
- `n` is greater than 0 (unchanged in the loop head).
- `a` is an input string (unchanged in the loop head).
- `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed (unchanged in the loop head).
- `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed (unchanged in the loop head).
- `i` is the current index (this is the only variable that changes in the loop head).

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`**.
