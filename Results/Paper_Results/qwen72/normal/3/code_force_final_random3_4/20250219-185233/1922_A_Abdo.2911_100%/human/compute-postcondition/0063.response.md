Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 0, and the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains False, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
