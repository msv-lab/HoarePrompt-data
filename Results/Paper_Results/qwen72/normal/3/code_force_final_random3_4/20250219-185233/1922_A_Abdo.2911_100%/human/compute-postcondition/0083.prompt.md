Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, and `possible` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` is True. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b` and the first character of `c` is equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` remains False. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains False. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]`, `possible` retains its initial value, and the program continues. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains True, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
