Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, and the first character of `c` is not equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` is True. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b` and the first character of `c` is equal to the first character of `a`, `possible` remains False. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains False. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True.***
