Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, and `possible` is either True or False depending on the conditions within the loop.**

Explanation:
- The code `c = input().strip()` updates the variable `c` to a new input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- The other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `possible`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state information for these variables is still valid after the code execution.
