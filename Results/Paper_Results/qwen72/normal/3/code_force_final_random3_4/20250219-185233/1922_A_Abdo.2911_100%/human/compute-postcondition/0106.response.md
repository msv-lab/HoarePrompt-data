Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is `True`, and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
