You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None, as the function `func_1` does not take any parameters and reads input directly from the user.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        x, y = S[-1]
        
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        
        S.append([x, y])
        
    #State: `n` is an integer value input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent sublist `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of '0's and non-'0's (respectively) in the string `a` up to that point.
    ans = -1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        
        lsum = i
        
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        
        rsum = n - i
        
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
            ans = i
        
    #State: `n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, and `ans` is the index `i` (0 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`) that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`. If no such index exists, `ans` remains -1.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the index i (0 ≤ i ≤ n) that minimizes the absolute difference between n / 2 and i while satisfying the conditions left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum, or -1 if no such index exists)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input directly from the user and returns a value based on that input.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
