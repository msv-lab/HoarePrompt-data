Output State: **`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the sublist `S[2]`, `lsum` is 2, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the sublist `S[2]`, `rsum` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is either -1, 0, or 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `right` is updated to be the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the sublist `S[2]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `S`, `left`, `lsum`, `rsum`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
