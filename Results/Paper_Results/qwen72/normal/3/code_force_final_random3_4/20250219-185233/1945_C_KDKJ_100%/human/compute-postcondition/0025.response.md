The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be such that `n + 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 0. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the `range(n + 1)`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is at least 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is -1**
