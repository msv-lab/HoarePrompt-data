Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` that many times. After the function concludes, the loop has completed all iterations, and `func_1` has been called the number of times equal to the integer input by the user. **
