Initial State: `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0
```
func_1()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The function `func_1()` is called, but since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the program state. The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. If `func_1()` does not modify these variables or any other variables, the state remains unchanged. However, if `func_1()` returns a value or modifies any variables, we would need to know the function's implementation to accurately describe the output state.

Since we do not have the function's implementation, we can only assume that the function does not modify the initial state.

Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
