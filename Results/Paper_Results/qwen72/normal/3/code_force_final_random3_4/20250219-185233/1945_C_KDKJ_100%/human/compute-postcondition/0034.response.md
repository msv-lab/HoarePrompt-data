Output State: **`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is 0, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the first sublist in `S`, `rsum` is `n`, and `left * 2` is greater than or equal to `lsum` and `right * 2` is greater than or equal to `rsum`. Additionally, the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
