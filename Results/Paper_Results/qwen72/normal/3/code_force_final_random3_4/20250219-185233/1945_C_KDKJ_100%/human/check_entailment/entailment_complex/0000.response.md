Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Preprocessing**:
   - `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the user.
   - It then constructs a list `S` where each element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to that point in the string `a`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The function iterates over all possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n`) to place the road.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: the number of '0's on the left side of the road.
     - `lsum`: the total number of houses on the left side of the road.
     - `right`: the number of '1's on the right side of the road.
     - `rsum`: the total number of houses on the right side of the road.
   - It checks if the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are satisfied. If not, it skips to the next position.
   - If the conditions are satisfied, it updates `ans` to the current position `i` if the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` is smaller than the current minimum difference `abs(n / 2 - ans)`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)` while satisfying the conditions. If no such position exists, it prints -1.

4. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the user.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the function is run for each input as described in the problem.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house (i = 0) or after the last house (i = n).
   - It also ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle of the village as possible, which is a requirement of the problem.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly processes the input and checks the conditions for each possible road position.
   - It updates the answer to the optimal position that minimizes the absolute difference while satisfying the conditions.
   - The function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
