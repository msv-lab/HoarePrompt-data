Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is the last index of the loop (which is `int(input()) - 1`), and `func_1()` has been called the number of times equal to `int(input())`.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has run the specified number of times, the input value must be at least as large as the number of iterations, the loop variable `_` has reached its final value, which is one less than the input value, and the function `func_1()` has been called as many times as the input value.
