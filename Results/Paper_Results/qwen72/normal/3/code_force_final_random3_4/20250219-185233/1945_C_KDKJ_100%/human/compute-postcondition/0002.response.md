The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop depends on the value returned by `int(input())` to determine how many times it will iterate. At the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 0. However, since `int(input())` is a function call that can return a different value each time it is called, we cannot assume its value remains the same. Instead, we need to consider the state at the start of the next iteration based on the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1**
