Output State: **`n` is an integer value input by the user that must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is the first element of the sublist `S[2]`, `lsum` is 2, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the sublist `S[2]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is either -1, 0, or 1. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only affects the flow of the loop by skipping the rest of the current iteration and moving to the next iteration. Therefore, all the initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
