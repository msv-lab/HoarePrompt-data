Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the user.
   - **Processing**:
     - It initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]` to keep track of the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
     - It iterates over the string `a` and updates the cumulative counts in `S`.
     - It then iterates over all possible positions `i` (0 to `n`) to find the optimal position for the road.
     - For each position `i`, it checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the left segment and the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the right segment.
     - If the condition is met, it updates the answer `ans` if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position.
   - **Output**: The function prints the optimal position `i` for the road. If no valid position is found, it prints -1.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Input**: The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases.
   - **Processing**:
     - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Output**: The function does not return any value, but `func_1` prints the output for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each one.
   - **Condition Checking**: `func_1` correctly checks the conditions for each possible road position `i` to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - **Optimal Position**: `func_1` correctly finds the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle of the village while satisfying the conditions.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as laying the road before the first house or after the last house.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road in each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
