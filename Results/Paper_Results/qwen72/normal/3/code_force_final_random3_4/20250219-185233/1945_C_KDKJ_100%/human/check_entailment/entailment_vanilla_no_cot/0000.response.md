Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - It initializes a list `S` with a starting point `[0, 0]` to keep track of the cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s up to each house.
   - It iterates through the string `a` and updates the cumulative counts in `S`.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - It initializes `ans` to `-1` to keep track of the best position found so far.
   - It iterates through all possible positions `i` (from `0` to `n` inclusive) where the road can be laid.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of `0`s and `1`s on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It checks if the number of `0`s on the left side is at least half of the left side houses and if the number of `1`s on the right side is at least half of the right side houses.
   - If the current position `i` satisfies the conditions and is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position, it updates `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After checking all positions, it prints the best position `ans`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the road is laid in the optimal position as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
