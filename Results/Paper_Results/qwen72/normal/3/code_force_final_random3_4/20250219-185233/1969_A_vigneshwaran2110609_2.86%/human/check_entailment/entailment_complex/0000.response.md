### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `x` which represents the number of friends, and a list `l` of integers representing the best friends of each friend.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The function then iterates over the list `l` and checks if there exists any index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`.
   - This condition is checking if there is a pair of friends where each is the best friend of the other. If such a pair exists, the function prints `2` because inviting both friends in the pair will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - If no such pair is found, the function prints `3` because it assumes that the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.

3. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is incorrect. It should be `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` to correctly check if the i-th friend and their best friend are each other's best friends.
   - The current condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is checking if the best friend of the best friend of the i-th friend is the best friend of the i-th friend, which is not the correct logic.

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - To ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party, we need to find a pair of friends where each is the best friend of the other. If such a pair exists, the minimum number of invitations required is 2.
   - If no such pair exists, the minimum number of invitations required is 3, as inviting any 3 friends will ensure that at least 2 of them will come to the party.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`, the correct pairs are (1, 3) and (2, 3), (4, 5). The function should print `2` because inviting friends 4 and 5 will ensure both come to the party.
   - For the input `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the correct pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1). The function should print `3` because no single pair exists where each is the best friend of the other, but inviting any 3 friends will ensure at least 2 come.
   - For the input `p = [2, 1]`, the correct pair is (1, 2) and (2, 1). The function should print `2` because inviting both friends will ensure both come to the party.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is not the correct way to check if a pair of friends are each other's best friends. The correct condition should be `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.

### Correctness:
**False**
