The function `func` should accept two parameters: an integer `n` and a list of integers `p`. `n` represents the number of friends, with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. `p` is a list of length `n`, where each element `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) represents the best friend of the friend `i`, and `p_i` is not equal to `i`. All elements in `p` are distinct.

The function returns a list of integers where each element at index `i` represents the best friend of friend `i`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `p`, and returns a list of integers where each element at index `i` represents the best friend of friend `i`.**
