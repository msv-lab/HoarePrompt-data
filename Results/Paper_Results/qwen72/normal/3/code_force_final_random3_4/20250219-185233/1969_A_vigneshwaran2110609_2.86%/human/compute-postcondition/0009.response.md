Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, `i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If the element at the index `l[0] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to `l[0] - 1`, then `flag` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as before without modifying `flag`.***
