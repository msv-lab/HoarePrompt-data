Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of determining whether, after `n` moves, a tower can have exactly `m` cubes. The key insight is that each move can either add or remove one cube, so the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves must be of the same parity (odd or even) as `n`. Additionally, the number of cubes `m` must be less than or equal to `n` because you cannot have more cubes than the number of moves.

The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

However, there is a minor issue in the program: the function `func_1` should be called with the appropriate number of arguments. The function definition and the function call should match. The function `func_1` should be defined to take no arguments, and the logic inside the function should handle the input and processing for each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

In the original program, the function `func_1` is defined correctly and the logic inside the function is correct. The function correctly checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative, which is the correct condition to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Given that the logic and the structure of the program are correct, the only issue is the function call, which is a minor mistake. However, the core logic and the problem-solving approach are correct.

Correctness: **True**  
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described, and the only minor issue (function call without arguments) does not affect the correctness of the solution.
