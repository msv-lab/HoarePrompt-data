Based on the initial state provided:

- The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters `n` and `m`.
- The input structure indicates that the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.
- Each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).
- The values of `n` and `m` are assigned based on the input.
- The condition given is that either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.

Given this precondition, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

Since the condition `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0` is always true based on the initial state, the `print` statement will always execute and print the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
