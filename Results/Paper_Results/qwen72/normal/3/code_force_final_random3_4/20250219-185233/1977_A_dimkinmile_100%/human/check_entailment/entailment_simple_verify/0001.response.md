### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the final number of cubes.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the final number of cubes, which is necessary because Nikita cannot have more cubes than the number of moves he has made.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - The function `func_1` is called `kreker` times, which is correct for handling multiple test cases.
  - The function `func_1` should be defined with parameters `n` and `m`, but in this case, it reads `n` and `m` directly from the input inside the function. This is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness of the program.

- **State inside `func_1`**:
  - The variables `n` and `m` are correctly read as integers from the input.
  - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
  - The condition `n - m >= 0` checks if the number of moves is at least as large as the final number of cubes.
  - If both conditions are true, the program prints "Yes".
  - If either condition is false, the program prints "No".

### Conclusion:
- The program's logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.
- The conditions used to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves are accurate.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the appropriate output for each case.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
