Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[1]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[1]`, `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[0] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[0]` if `l == h`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[1]`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `f` is `F[1]`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[1]` and must be greater than `l`.**
