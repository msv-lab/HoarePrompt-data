Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[l] + F[1]`, `mid_next_sum` is undefined because `mid + 1` is not within the bounds of `D`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[1]` or -1 if no such element exists, `mid` is equal to `l`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, and `f` is `F[2]`.**

Explanation:
- `l` is updated to the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]` using the `bisect_right` function.
- The values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `h`, `mid`, `ans`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial state.
