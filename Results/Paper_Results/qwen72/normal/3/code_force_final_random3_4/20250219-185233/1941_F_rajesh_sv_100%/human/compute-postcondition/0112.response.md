Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[2]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[2]` if `mid + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, otherwise `mid_next_sum` is undefined, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]` or -1 if no such element exists, `mid` is `l` (since `l` and `h` converge), `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, `f` is `F[2]`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the following conditions hold:
- `mid_sum` is the sum of the element at the index `mid` in `D` and `F[2]`.
- `mid_next_sum` is the sum of the element at the index `mid + 1` in `D` and `F[2]`, but only if `mid + 1` is within the bounds of `D`; otherwise, it is undefined.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`.
- `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]`, or -1 if no such element exists.
- `mid` is equal to `l` because the loop continues to narrow the range between `l` and `h` until they converge.
- `ans` is the minimum value between the initial `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]` after all iterations.
- `f` remains `F[2]` as it is not modified within the loop.
