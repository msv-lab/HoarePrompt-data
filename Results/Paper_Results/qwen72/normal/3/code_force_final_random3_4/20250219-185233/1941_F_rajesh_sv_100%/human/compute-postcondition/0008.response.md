The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. Since there are no parameters and no specific output conditions provided, the function's return value is not explicitly defined and could be anything, including `None` if no return statement is present. However, without more context, we cannot determine the exact return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to execute some code and return a value, which is not specified in the given information.
