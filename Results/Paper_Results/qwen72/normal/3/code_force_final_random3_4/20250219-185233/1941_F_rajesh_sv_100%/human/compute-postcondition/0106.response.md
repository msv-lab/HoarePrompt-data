To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `l` and `h`. The loop condition is `l < h`. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than `h`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[2]`
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[2]`
- `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`
- `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]`
- `h` must be greater than `l`
- `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`
- `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`
- `f` is `F[2]`

The loop body updates `l` or `h` based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`:
- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than `h` after the update. Since `h` must be greater than `l` at the end of the previous iteration, and `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, the following must hold true:
- If `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, `h` must still be greater than `mid + 1`.
- If `h` is updated to `mid`, `l` must still be less than `mid`.

Given that `mid` is the midpoint between `l` and `h`, and `h` is greater than `l`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `h` is greater than `l` after the update.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state, as the loop condition `l < h` is already satisfied and will remain satisfied based on the given updates.

State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[2]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[2]`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]`, `h` must be greater than `l`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, `f` is `F[2]`**
