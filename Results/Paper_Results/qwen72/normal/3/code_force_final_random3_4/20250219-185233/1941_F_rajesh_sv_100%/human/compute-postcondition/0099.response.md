Postcondition: ***`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[2]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[2]`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]`, `h` must be greater than `l`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, `f` is `F[2]`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.***
