To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `l` and `h`. The loop condition is `l < h`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `l` is the index in `D` where the value `left - F[0]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`.
- `h` is the index in `D` where the value `right - F[0]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D` minus 1.

For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `h`. Since `D` is a sorted list of unique integers and `left` and `right` are elements from `A` with `left < right`, it is reasonable to assume that `left - F[0]` will be less than `right - F[0]`. Therefore, `l` should be less than `h`.

However, the initial state does not guarantee that `l` is less than `h`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state so that `l` is less than `h`.

Since `D` is a sorted list and `left < right`, the only way to ensure `l < h` is to ensure that `left - F[0]` is less than `right - F[0]` and that these values are within the bounds of `D`.

Given that `D` is a sorted list of unique integers, and assuming `F[0]` is a valid integer, the condition `left < right` should naturally lead to `left - F[0] < right - F[0]`, which should result in `l < h`.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed beyond ensuring that `left < right` and `D` is a valid sorted list. The state can be repeated as is, with the understanding that `l` and `h` are derived from valid operations on `D` and the values `left - F[0]` and `right - F[0]`.

State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where the value `left - F[0]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`, `h` is the index in `D` where the value `right - F[0]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D` minus 1.**
