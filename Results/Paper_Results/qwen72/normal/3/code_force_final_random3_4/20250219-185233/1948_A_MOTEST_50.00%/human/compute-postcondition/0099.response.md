Output State: **`s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is the initial input integer, `i` is `t - 1`, and `n` is the last input integer. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is greater than 1 and even, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is greater than 1 and odd, `x` is `n // 2`, `ans` is 'AAABBCC...CC' (where 'C' is the last character added, and the total number of characters in `ans` is `3 + 2 * (n // 2 - 1)`), and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The string `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- The variable `t` retains its initial value, which is the number of test cases.
- The loop counter `i` is `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed `t` iterations.
- The variable `n` is the last input integer provided for the final iteration.
- If `n` is 1, the loop prints 'NO' and no changes are made to `ans`, `x`, or `j`.
- If `n` is greater than 1 and even, the loop prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` where each of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` is repeated twice, and the loop variables `x` and `j` are updated accordingly.
- If `n` is greater than 1 and odd, the loop prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` starting with 'AAA' and then each of the next `n // 2 - 1` characters of `s` is repeated twice, and the loop variables `x` and `j` are updated accordingly.
