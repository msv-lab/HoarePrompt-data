Output State: **`s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 0, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` (which is 'A') repeated twice to the string `ans`. Since `x` is 0, the character 'A' is appended twice, making `ans` equal to 'AA'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
