Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Dictionary `d`**:
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka`, and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`.

2. **List `pl`**:
   - `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.

3. **Variable `shapes`**:
   - `shapes` is the sum of the integer division of each value in `d` by 3 for all keys in `pl` that have a value of 3 or more.

4. **Variable `_`**:
   - `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `pl` and must be less than `w`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged and are not directly relevant to the `print(shapes)` statement.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Construct `d`**:
   - Suppose `palka` is a list of integers. For example, if `palka = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]`, then:
     - `d` will be `{1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 1, 5: 3}`.

2. **Construct `pl`**:
   - `pl` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` because it contains all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.

3. **Calculate `shapes`**:
   - We need to sum the integer division of each value in `d` by 3 for all keys in `pl` that have a value of 3 or more.
   - From `d`, the keys with values of 3 or more are `1` and `3` and `5`.
   - The values for these keys are `3`, `4`, and `3`.
   - The integer division of these values by 3 is:
     - `3 // 3 = 1`
     - `4 // 3 = 1`
     - `3 // 3 = 1`
   - Therefore, `shapes` is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

### Final Output:

The `print(shapes)` statement will print the value of `shapes`, which is the sum of the integer division of each value in `d` by 3 for all keys in `pl` that have a value of 3 or more.

Output: **3 (where 3 is the sum of the integer division of each value in `d` by 3 for all keys in `pl` that have a value of 3 or more)**
