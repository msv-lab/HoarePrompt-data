You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `w` iterations, and for each iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the number of elements in each test case), and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (the elements for each test case). It processes these parameters and returns a result based on the test cases and their elements.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
