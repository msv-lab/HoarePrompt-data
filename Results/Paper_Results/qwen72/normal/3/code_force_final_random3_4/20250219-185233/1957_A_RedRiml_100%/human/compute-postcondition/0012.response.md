Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in `palka`, `pl` is an empty list, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i) == None`, then `d` has the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `i` is not in `pl`.**
