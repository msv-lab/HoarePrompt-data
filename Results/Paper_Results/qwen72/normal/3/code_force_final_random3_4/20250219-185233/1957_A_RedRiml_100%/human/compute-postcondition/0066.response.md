Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `d.get(i) == None`, `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. In both cases, `pl` now includes the third element in `palka` as an additional element if it was not already in `pl`, and `shapes` remains unchanged.***
