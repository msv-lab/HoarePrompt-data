The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `pl`. For the loop to execute, `pl` must contain at least one element. The variable `j` will take on the value of the first element in `pl` at the start of the first iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100
- `w` is greater than 0
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`
- `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared
- `shapes` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, `pl` must have at least one element. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `pl` has at least one element, and `j` is the first element in `pl`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `pl`, `shapes` is 0**
