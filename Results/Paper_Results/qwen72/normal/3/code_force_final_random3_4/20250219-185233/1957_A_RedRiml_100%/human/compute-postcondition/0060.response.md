Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `i` is not in `pl`, `d[i]` is set to 1 and `i` is added to `pl`. If `d[i]` was already in `d`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1 and `shapes` remains unchanged. `pl` now includes `i` as an additional element if `i` was not already in `pl`.***
