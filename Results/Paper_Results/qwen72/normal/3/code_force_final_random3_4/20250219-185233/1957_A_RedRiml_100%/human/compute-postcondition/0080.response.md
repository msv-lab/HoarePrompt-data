To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This represents the number of test cases.
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) for each test case. This represents the number of elements in the list `a`.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\). These are the elements of the list `a`.
   - `w` is greater than 0. This is some integer value, but its exact use is not specified in the given context.
   - `ln` is an input integer. This represents the length of the list `palka`.
   - `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements. Each element in `palka` is an integer.
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`.
   - `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`.
   - `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3.

2. **Computation:**
   - The dictionary `d` is created by counting the occurrences of each unique integer in the list `palka`.
   - The list `pl` contains all unique integers from `palka`.
   - The variable `shapes` is calculated by summing the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `palka` is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.
   - The dictionary `d` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}`.
   - The list `pl` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - The counts of integers that appear 3 or more times are 3 (for the integer 3) and 4 (for the integer 4).
   - The integer divisions of these counts by 3 are \(3 // 3 = 1\) and \(4 // 3 = 1\).
   - Therefore, `shapes` would be \(1 + 1 = 2\).

4. **General Case:**
   - For any given `palka`, the value of `shapes` will be the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(shapes)` statement will print the value of `shapes`, which is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3)**
