Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the integer `i` if `i` was not in `pl` initially, and `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` and the value 1 if `d.get(i) == None` initially, or the value associated with the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None` initially. `pl` now contains the integer `i` appended to it, and `d` is not modified if `i` was already in `pl`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pl.append(i)` appends the integer `i` to the list `pl`.
- If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged, and `d` is not modified.
- If `i` was not in `pl` initially, `i` is appended to `pl`, and `d` is updated to reflect the count of `i` in `pl`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `i`) remain unchanged.
