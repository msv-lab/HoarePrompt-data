Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

# Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads an integer `w` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of elements, followed by a list of `ln` integers. It then calculates and prints the number of groups of three identical integers that can be formed from the list for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not modified by the function.
