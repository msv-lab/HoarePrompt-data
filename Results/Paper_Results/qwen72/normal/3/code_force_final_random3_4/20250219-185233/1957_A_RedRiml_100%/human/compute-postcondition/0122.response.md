The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the number of elements in each test case), and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (the elements for each test case). 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100.
- Each element `a_i` is an integer where 1 <= a_i <= 100.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but it is expected to process these parameters and return a result based on the test cases and their elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the number of elements in each test case), and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (the elements for each test case). It processes these parameters and returns a result based on the test cases and their elements.**
