Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `func_1()` has been called.**

The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0. The code snippet calls the function `func_1()`, but since the function's implementation is not provided, we cannot determine any specific changes to the variables or the state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that `func_1()` has been called.
