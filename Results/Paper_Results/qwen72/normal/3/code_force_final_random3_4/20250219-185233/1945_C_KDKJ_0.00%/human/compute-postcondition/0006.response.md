Output State: **`int(input())` iterations have completed, `_` is `int(input()) - 1`, and `func_1()` has been called `int(input())` times.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has run the number of times specified by the user input, the loop variable `_` has reached the value `int(input()) - 1` (which is the last index of the range), and the function `func_1()` has been called exactly `int(input())` times.
