Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left` is equal to `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
