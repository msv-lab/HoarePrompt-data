Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is equal to `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is set to 0.***
