Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string, `S` is a list containing `[0, 0]` followed by `len(a)` sublists, each representing the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to that point in the string `a`. The last sublist in `S` contains the total count of '0's and '1's in the entire string `a`. `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - lsum
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `left` is equal to `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `left` is equal to `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is set to 1. If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is greater than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is equal to `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, and `ans` remains unchanged if `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`. If neither condition is true, `ans` is set to 2 if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the original value of `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
