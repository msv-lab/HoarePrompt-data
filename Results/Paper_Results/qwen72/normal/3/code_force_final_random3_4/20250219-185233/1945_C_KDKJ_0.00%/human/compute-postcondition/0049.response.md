Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `left` is equal to `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is equal to `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is equal to `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is equal to `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lsum` is updated to `S[2][0] + S[2][1]` because `i` is 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `left`, `right`, `rsum`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
