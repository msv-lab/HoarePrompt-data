Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string, `S` is a list containing `[0, 0]` followed by `len(a)` sublists, each representing the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to that point in the string `a`. The last sublist in `S` contains the total count of '0's and '1's in the entire string `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as the input integer.
- The variable `a` remains unchanged as the input string.
- The list `S` starts with the initial sublist `[0, 0]` and is followed by `len(a)` sublists. Each of these sublists contains two elements: the first element is the cumulative count of '0's encountered so far in the string `a`, and the second element is the cumulative count of '1's encountered so far. The last sublist in `S` will have the total count of '0's and '1's in the entire string `a`.
