Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least `len(rev_val)` elements, `x` is `len(rev_val) - 1`. `rev_res` is a string that contains the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has the same length as the original string, plus the string representation of all elements in `rev_val` at even indices, and the reversed string of all elements in `rev_val` at odd indices. If `10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is 1, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list` + (len(rev_val) - 1), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string, and `rev_res` is a string that concatenates the string representations of the integer values of the elements at even indices in `rev_val` and the reversed strings of the elements at odd indices in `rev_val`. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `max_power`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 2, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings with at least one element, `x` is the last element of `rev_val`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the last element of `operational_list`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different string length compared to their original string length, and `rev_res` is a string that contains the concatenated results of the loop, where for each even index in `rev_val`, the integer value of the element is appended to `rev_res`, and for each odd index, the reversed string of the element is appended to `rev_res`. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than \(10\) raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`, then the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than \(10\) raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`. Otherwise, the integer value of `rev_res` is less than or equal to \(10\) raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
