Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the third element of `operational_list`, `rev_res` remains an empty string, `rev_val` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- `x_rev` is assigned the integer value of the reversed string of the third element of `operational_list`.
- The values of `y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- Since the code snippet only updates `x_rev` and does not execute the conditional logic, `rev_res` and `rev_val` remain as they were initially (empty string and empty list, respectively).
