Postcondition: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings with at least one element, `x` is the last element of `rev_val`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the last element of `operational_list`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different string length compared to their original string length, and `rev_res` is a string that contains the concatenated results of the loop, where for each even index in `rev_val`, the integer value of the element is appended to `rev_res`, and for each odd index, the reversed string of the element is appended to `rev_res`. Additionally, `10 ** int(max_power)` is greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)`.**
