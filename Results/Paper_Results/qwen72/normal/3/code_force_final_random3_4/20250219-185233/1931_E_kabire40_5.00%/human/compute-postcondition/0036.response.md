Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 1, `val_in` is the second element of `rev_val`, `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` plus the reversed string of `val_in`.** 

The value of `rev_res` is updated by appending the reversed string of `val_in` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
