Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` is a positive integer greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings where each element is a part of the input string split by spaces, `x` is the last element of `operational_list` + 1, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of at least one element of `operational_list` whose reversed integer values do not have the same length as the original string and has at least one more element, `rev_res` is updated to include the reversed string of the element at index `x` in the list `rev_val`.** 

In natural language: The variable `rev_res` is updated to include the reversed string of the element at index `x` in the list `rev_val`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `rev_res` is now the concatenation of its previous value and the reversed string of `val_in`.
