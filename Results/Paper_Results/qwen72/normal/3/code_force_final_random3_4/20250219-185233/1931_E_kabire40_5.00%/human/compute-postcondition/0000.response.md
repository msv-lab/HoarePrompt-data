To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `y` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
2. **Initial state of `y`**: Before the loop starts, `y` should be 0 because it is the starting point of the `range` function.
3. **Input state**: The input provided to `int(input())` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

The only relevant state for the loop to execute is the input provided to `int(input())`.

State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer**
