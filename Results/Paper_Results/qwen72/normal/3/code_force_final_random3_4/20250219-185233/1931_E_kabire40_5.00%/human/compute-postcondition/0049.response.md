Postcondition: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least `len(rev_val)` elements, `x` is `len(rev_val) - 1`. `rev_res` is a string that contains the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer representation has the same length as the original string, plus the string representation of all elements in `rev_val` at even indices, and the reversed string of all elements in `rev_val` at odd indices. If `10 ** int(max_power)` is less than `int(rev_res)`, the value of `rev_res` is greater than `10 ** int(max_power)`. Otherwise, the value of `rev_res` is less than or equal to `10 ** int(max_power)`.**
