Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer greater than 0, `ps` is an integer greater than 0.** 

The initial state specified that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and the code snippet converts the input strings `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` to integers. Therefore, these variables are now integers, and they retain the condition of being greater than 0. The placeholder `_` remains unchanged.
