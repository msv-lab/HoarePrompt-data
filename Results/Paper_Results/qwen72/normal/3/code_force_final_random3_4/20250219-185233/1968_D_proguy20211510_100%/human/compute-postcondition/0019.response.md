Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` (where `pb` is the new value) and the previously appended element `a[pb - 1]` (where `pb` is the old value), `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except the element at index `pb - 1` (where `pb` is the new value), which is set to 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**

In natural language: The value of `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. The list `pathb` now contains the element `a[pb - 1]` where `pb` is the new value, along with the previously appended element `a[pb - 1]` where `pb` was the old value. The list `vis` is updated to have a 1 at the index `pb - 1` (using the new value of `pb`), and all other elements remain 0. If the element at `vis[pb - 1]` (using the new value of `pb`) is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `paths`) remain unchanged.
