The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `pathb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `pathb` and the value of `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `pathb`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `pathb` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`resb` is the maximum of `0` and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `curr` is `pathb[1] * (k - 1)`**
