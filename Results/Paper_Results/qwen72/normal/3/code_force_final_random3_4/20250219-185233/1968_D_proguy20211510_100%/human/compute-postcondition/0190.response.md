Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop has completed all iterations.
- `i` is `len(paths) - 1`.
- `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements.
- `curr` is calculated as `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`.
- `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`.
- `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations.
- `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('Draw')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
