Output State: **`i` is 0, `paths` must have at least one element, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, if `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pres` is incremented by `paths[0]`.
- The values of `i`, `paths`, `curr`, and the condition for `k` remain unchanged.
