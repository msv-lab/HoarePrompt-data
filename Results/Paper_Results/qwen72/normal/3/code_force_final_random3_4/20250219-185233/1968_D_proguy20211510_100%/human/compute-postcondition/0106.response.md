For the `while True:` loop, the condition is always true, meaning the loop will always execute at least once, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros of length `n` with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1**
