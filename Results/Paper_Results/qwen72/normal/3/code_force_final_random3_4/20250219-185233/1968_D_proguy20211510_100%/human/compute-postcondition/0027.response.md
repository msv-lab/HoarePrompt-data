Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with elements set to 1 at the indices visited by `pb` during the loop iterations.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop continues to append elements from the list `a` to `pathb` based on the sequence of indices specified by the list `p`, starting from the initial value of `pb - 1`.
- The value of `pb` is updated to the next index in the sequence defined by `p` after each iteration.
- The loop terminates when `pb` points to an index that has already been visited, as indicated by the list `vis`.
- The final state of `pathb` contains all the elements from `a` that were appended during the loop's execution.
- The list `vis` will have 1s at the indices that were visited by `pb` during the loop's execution.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `paths`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
