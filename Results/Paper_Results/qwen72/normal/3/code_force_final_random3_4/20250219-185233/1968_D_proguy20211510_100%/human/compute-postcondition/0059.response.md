Output State: **`preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is the final index in the sequence of `p` that leads back to a previously visited index, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `ps - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except those indices that have been visited, which are set to 1, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 1, `pathb` must have at least 2 elements. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `curr` is updated to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`.
- The value of `preb` remains `preb + pathb[i]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
