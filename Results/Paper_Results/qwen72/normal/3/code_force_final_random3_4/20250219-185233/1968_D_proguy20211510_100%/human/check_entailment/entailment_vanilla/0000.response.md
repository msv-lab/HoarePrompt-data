### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - It starts from `pb` and `ps` and follows the permutation until it detects a cycle (i.e., a position that has already been visited).

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by iterating through their respective paths.
   - For each position in the path, it calculates the potential score if the player stays at that position for the remaining turns.
   - It uses a `preb` and `pres` variable to keep track of the cumulative score up to the current position.
   - The `curr` variable is used to calculate the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.

4. **Output**:
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program correctly detects cycles, but it does not handle the case where the cycle length is greater than `k`. This is not a problem because the game only lasts `k` turns, and the cycle detection ensures that the path is followed only up to the cycle.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score calculation logic is correct, but it assumes that the player will always stay at the current position for the remaining turns. This might not always be the optimal strategy, but given the problem constraints, it is a valid approach.
   - The program uses `max` to ensure that the highest possible score is considered, which is appropriate for the given problem.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `k` being 1 or the starting positions being the same.
   - It also handles large values of `k` and `n` within the constraints provided.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and constraints. It correctly parses the input, detects cycles, calculates scores, and outputs the result.
