### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Path Traversal:**
   - The function initializes two empty lists `pathb` and `paths` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions in the permutation.
   - For Bodya, it starts at position `P_B` and follows the permutation `p` until it encounters a visited position, appending the corresponding scores from `a` to `pathb`.
   - Similarly, for Sasha, it starts at position `P_S` and follows the permutation `p` until it encounters a visited position, appending the corresponding scores from `a` to `paths`.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function initializes `resb` and `ress` to 0, which will store the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes `preb` and `pres` to 0, which will store the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - For Bodya, it iterates through the `pathb` list, calculating the score for each position and updating `resb` to the maximum score found.
   - Similarly, for Sasha, it iterates through the `paths` list, calculating the score for each position and updating `ress` to the maximum score found.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum possible scores for both players, the function compares `resb` and `ress` and prints the winner or "Draw" accordingly.

### Issues:
- **Variable Naming:** The function uses `YES` and `NO` variables, which are not used in the logic. These can be removed to clean up the code.
- **Modulo Operation:** The `MOD` variable is defined but not used. This can also be removed.
- **Alpha Variable:** The `alpha` variable is defined but not used. This can be removed.
- **Path Traversal Logic:** The path traversal logic correctly identifies the cycle in the permutation and stops when a cycle is detected. This ensures that the function does not get stuck in an infinite loop.
- **Score Calculation Logic:** The score calculation logic correctly computes the maximum possible score for each player by considering the cumulative scores and the number of turns remaining.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. It correctly reads the input, follows the permutation to identify cycles, calculates the scores, and determines the winner or a draw.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
