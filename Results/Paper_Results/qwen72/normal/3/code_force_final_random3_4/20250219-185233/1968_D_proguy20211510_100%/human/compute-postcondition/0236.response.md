Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the following changes have occurred:**

- `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the elements at the indices that were visited during the loop, which are now 1.
- `i` is `len(paths) - 1`.
- `paths` contains all the elements from the list `a` that were accessed during the loop, starting from `a[ps - 1]` and following the sequence defined by the list `p`.
- `curr` is the final value of `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`.
- `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`.
- `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations.
- `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`.
- `ps` is the index that caused the loop to break, i.e., the index where `vis[ps - 1]` was already 1, or the last element in `pathb` if no repetition was found.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, and all subsequent elements until a repeated index is found in `vis`.
