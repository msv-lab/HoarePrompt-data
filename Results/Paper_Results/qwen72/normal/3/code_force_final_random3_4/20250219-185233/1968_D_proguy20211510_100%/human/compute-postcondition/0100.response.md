Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are updated to their integer values, `pres` is updated to `pres + sum(paths[:min(k, len(paths))])`, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(pathb)) - 1`, `i` is `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[min(k, len(paths)) - 1] * (k - (min(k, len(paths)) - 1))`, `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`, `paths` must have at least `min(k, len(paths))` elements, the values of `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `vis` remain unchanged. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, `resb` is greater than `ress`. Otherwise, `ress` is greater than or equal to `resb`. The loop will execute again if the next `int(input())` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are converted to integers.
- The values of `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, and `ress` are updated based on the integer values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
- The conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
- The loop will execute again if the next `int(input())` is greater than 0.
