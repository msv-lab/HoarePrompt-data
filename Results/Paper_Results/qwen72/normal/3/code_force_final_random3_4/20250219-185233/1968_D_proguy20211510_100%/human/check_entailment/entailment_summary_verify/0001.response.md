### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.
   - This part of the program is accurate and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - It starts from `P_B` and `P_S` and follows the permutation until it detects a cycle (i.e., a position that has already been visited).
   - This approach is correct and ensures that the paths are followed only up to the cycle, which is essential for the game's rules.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by iterating through their respective paths.
   - For each position in the path, it calculates the potential score if the player stays at that position for the remaining turns.
   - It uses `preb` and `pres` variables to keep track of the cumulative score up to the current position.
   - The `curr` variable is used to calculate the score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
   - The use of `max` ensures that the highest possible score is considered, which is appropriate for the given problem.

4. **Output**:
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.
   - This part of the program is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

5. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program assumes that the optimal strategy is to stay at the current position for the remaining turns. This assumption is valid because the problem does not specify any other strategy, and staying at the current position maximizes the score for the remaining turns.
   - The logic for calculating the score is consistent with the rules of the game, where the player can either stay or move to `p_x` on each turn.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `k` being 1 or the starting positions being the same.
   - It also handles large values of `k` and `n` within the constraints provided.
   - The program correctly manages the cycle detection and ensures that the paths are followed only up to the cycle, which is crucial for the game's rules.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly parses the input, detects cycles, calculates scores, and outputs the result based on the given problem description and constraints.

Final: **True**
