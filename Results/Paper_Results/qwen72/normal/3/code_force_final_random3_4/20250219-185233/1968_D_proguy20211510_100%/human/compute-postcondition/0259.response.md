The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `paths`. To ensure the loop executes, `paths` must have at least one element, and `i` must be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `resb` is the maximum value of the cumulative sums `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= i + 1`.
- `ress` is 0.
- `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`.
- `pres` is 0.
- `pathb` is a list with at least `len(pathb)` elements.
- `i` is `len(pathb) - 1`.
- `curr` is the last computed value of `preb + pathb[len(pathb) - 1] * (k - (len(pathb) - 1))`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
- `i` must be 0.
- `paths` must have at least one element.

The adjusted state should be:
State: **`resb` is the maximum value of the cumulative sums `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= i + 1`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least `len(pathb)` elements, `i` is 0, `paths` must have at least one element, `curr` is the last computed value of `preb + pathb[len(pathb) - 1] * (k - (len(pathb) - 1))`**
