Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `paths` must have at least three elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[2] * (k - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[2]`, and `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `pres + paths[1] * k`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
