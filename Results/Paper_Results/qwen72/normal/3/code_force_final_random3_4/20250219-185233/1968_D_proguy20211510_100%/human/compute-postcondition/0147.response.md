Postcondition: ***`vis` is a list where the element at index `ps - 1` is now 1, and all other elements remain 0. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `n`, `k`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `curr`, and `ress` are unchanged. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. `pathb` must have at least one element. `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `ps - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again. `ps` is now the index where the loop first encountered a previously visited index. `resb` is 0. `ress` is 0. `preb` is 0. `pres` is 0. `i` is 0. If `k` is less than `i + 1` (which is 1), the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
