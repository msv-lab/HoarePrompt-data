Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime_to_i * prime * prime * prime`, `factor` is the next element from `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be a non-negative integer, a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, `_` is incremented by 1, `factors[prime] + 1` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**

Explanation:
- `prime_to_i` is updated by multiplying it with `prime` again, so it becomes `prime_to_i * prime * prime * prime`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
