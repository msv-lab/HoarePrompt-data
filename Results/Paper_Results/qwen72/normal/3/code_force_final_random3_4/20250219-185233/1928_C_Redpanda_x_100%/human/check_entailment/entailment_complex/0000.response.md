### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Vasya is given a position `n` in the line and a number `x` he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - We need to find all natural numbers `k` such that the given `n` and `x` fit the settling pattern.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to return a generator that yields all divisors of `n`.
   - It performs prime factorization of `n` and stores the prime factors and their powers in a dictionary `factors`.
   - It then uses the `generate` function to yield all divisors of `n`.

3. **Function `generate`**:
   - This function is a recursive generator that yields all possible products of the prime factors of `n` raised to their respective powers.
   - It works by recursively generating the divisors of the remaining part of `n` and then multiplying these by the current prime factor raised to all possible powers.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the main logic calculates two sets of possible `k` values:
     - One set is derived from `n - x`.
     - Another set is derived from `n + x - 2` if `x` is not 1.
   - It then filters these sets to ensure that `k` is even and `k / 2 + 1 >= x`.
   - Finally, it prints the size of the union of these two sets.

5. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Prime Factorization**: The prime factorization in `func_1` is correct. It correctly identifies all prime factors and their powers.
   - **Divisor Generation**: The `generate` function correctly generates all divisors of `n` by recursively multiplying the prime factors.
   - **Filtering and Union**: The main logic correctly filters the divisors to ensure they meet the conditions `k % 2 == 0` and `k / 2 + 1 >= x`.
   - **Edge Cases**: The logic handles the edge case where `x` is 1 by only considering `n - x` and not `n + x - 2`.

However, there is a minor issue in the state description of `func_1`:
   - The comment states that if `nn > 1`, `factors[1]` is increased by 1, which is incorrect. It should be `factors[nn]` instead of `factors[1]`.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor comment issue, the logic and implementation of the program are correct and meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
