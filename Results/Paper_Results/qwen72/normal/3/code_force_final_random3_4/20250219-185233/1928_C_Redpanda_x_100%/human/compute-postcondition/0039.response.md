Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k] * primes[k] * primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is `factors[prime] + 1`, a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation:
- The value of `prime_to_i` is updated by multiplying it with `prime`.
- Since `prime_to_i` was initially `primes[k] * primes[k]`, after the multiplication, it becomes `primes[k] * primes[k] * primes[k]`.
- The values of `k`, `rest`, `prime`, `factor`, `factors[prime]`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, but the specific value of `factor` is not provided, so it remains as a symbolic expression.
