Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements of `l`, and `m` is the length of `l`. If 1 is in `l`, the set `e` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in `e`.**

The code `e = set(l)` converts the list `l` into a set `e` containing only the unique elements of `l`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The set `e` now contains the unique elements from the list `l`. If 1 is present in `l`, it will be included in `e`. If 1 is not in `l`, it will not be in `e`.
