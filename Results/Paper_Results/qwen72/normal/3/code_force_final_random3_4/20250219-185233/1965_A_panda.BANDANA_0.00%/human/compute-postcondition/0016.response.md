The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'Bob' to the console. The initial state provides information about variables `i`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
