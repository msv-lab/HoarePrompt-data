#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n representing the number of piles, and a list of n integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function should be able to process an input t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        e = set(l)
        
        m = len(l)
        
        if 1 in l:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `i` is `t-1`, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `e` is a set containing the unique elements of `l`, and `m` is the length of `l`. If 1 is in `l`, the set `e` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in `e`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, the function checks if the list contains the integer 1. If 1 is present, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program includes the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` as described in the annotations, but these variables are not returned or further used. The function's primary purpose is to determine and print the winner ("Bob" or "Alice") for each test case based on the presence of the integer 1 in the list of stones.
