Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `cases` is greater than 0 (this is not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it.
- `k` is 1.
- `range` is 3 (this is not directly relevant to the print statement).
- `lex` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it:**
   - This means `arr` is a list that is initially sorted, and then `lex` is added to it. The list `arr` will be sorted again after appending `lex`.

2. **`k` is 1:**
   - The index `k` is 1, so we are accessing the second element of the list `arr`.

3. **`lex` is an input integer:**
   - `lex` is an integer provided as input. We don't know its exact value, but it will be appended to the sorted list `arr`.

4. **`print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`:**
   - The `print` statement will print the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`.
   - The `end=''` parameter ensures that the print statement does not add a newline at the end.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `arr` is a sorted list and `lex` is appended to it, the list `arr` will be sorted again.
- The value of `arr[k]` (where `k` is 1) will be the second smallest element in the sorted list `arr`.
- The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding character in the ASCII table.
- Adding 96 to the integer value of `arr[k]` will shift the ASCII value to the corresponding lowercase letter (since ASCII values for lowercase letters start at 97 for 'a').

### Example:
- If `arr` is initially `[1, 2, 3]` and `lex` is 4, then `arr` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]` after appending and sorting.
- The second element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[1]`) is 2.
- `chr(2 + 96)` is `chr(98)`, which corresponds to the character 'b'.

### General Case:
- The second element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[1]`) will be the second smallest element in the sorted list.
- The character printed will be the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `arr[1] + 96`.

### Final Output:
Output: **[chr(arr[1] + 96)] (where `arr[1]` is the second smallest element in the sorted list `arr`)**
