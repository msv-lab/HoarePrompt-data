Precondition: **The function should take an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases and the encoded word for each test case. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def func(t, cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `cases` is a list of integers, each representing an encoded word for a test case. 

Given the original function definition, the precondition would be:

**The function should be called with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and a list of integers cases, where each integer n in cases satisfies 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.**
