The value `26` is appended to the list `arr`. The previous value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`:

- If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` was `[1, 1]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` was `[26, 1]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` was `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 77, `arr` was also `[26, 26]`.

After appending `26`, the new value of `arr` will be:

- `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` is less than or equal to 25.
- `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51.
- `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77.
- `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex` is greater than 77.

The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `range` remain unchanged, and the value of `lex` is not affected.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `arr` is `[1, 1, 26]` if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]` if `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex` is greater than 51, `lex` is unchanged.**
