The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `range`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `range`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `range` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `range` must still be 3.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains an additional element 1, and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 1, with the new value of `lex` being less than or equal to 25. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the element 26, and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 26.**
