Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the range is 2. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list with one element [1]. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing [26].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the range is 2. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `lex` is now less than or equal to 24, and `arr` is a list with two elements [1, 1]. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 26, `lex` is now greater than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing [26, 1]. If `lex` is greater than 25, `arr` is a list containing [26, 26] and `lex` is now `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing [26, 26] and `lex` is now `lex - 26`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the range is 2. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `lex` is now less than or equal to 23, and `arr` is a list with three elements [1, 1, 1]. If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, `lex` is now `lex - 27`, and `arr` is a list containing [26, 1, 1]. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is now `lex - 52`, and `arr` is a list containing [26, 26, 26].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
