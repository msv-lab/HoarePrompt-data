Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` contains the element 26, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 26.**

The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial condition that `lex` is greater than 26 is still valid, and `arr` still contains the element 26.
