Let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `arr` is defined based on the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`.
     - If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr` is `[1, lex - 27, 26]`.
     - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.
   - `k` is 2.
   - `range` is 3.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement is `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.

3. **Determine the Value of `arr[k]`:**
   - `k` is 2, so we need to find the value of `arr[2]` based on the different conditions for `lex`.

4. **Evaluate `arr[2]` Based on `lex`:**
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`. Therefore, `arr[2]` is `lex - 2`.
   - If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr` is `[1, lex - 27, 26]`. Therefore, `arr[2]` is 26.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`. Therefore, `arr[2]` is `lex - 52`.

5. **Convert `arr[2]` to a Character:**
   - The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The ASCII value for 'a' is 97, so `chr(96 + n)` will give the character `n` places after 'a' in the alphabet.

6. **Calculate the Output:**
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr[2]` is `lex - 2`, so `chr(arr[2] + 96)` is `chr(lex - 2 + 96)`, which is `chr(lex + 94)`.
   - If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr[2]` is 26, so `chr(arr[2] + 96)` is `chr(26 + 96)`, which is `chr(122)`, which is 'z'.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr[2]` is `lex - 52`, so `chr(arr[2] + 96)` is `chr(lex - 52 + 96)`, which is `chr(lex + 44)`.

7. **Final Output:**
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, the output will be the character corresponding to `chr(lex + 94)`.
   - If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, the output will be 'z'.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, the output will be the character corresponding to `chr(lex + 44)`.

Since the exact value of `lex` is not provided, we need to describe the output based on the possible values of `lex`.

Output: **[chr(lex + 94) if lex <= 25, 'z' if 25 < lex < 52, chr(lex + 44) if lex >= 52]**
