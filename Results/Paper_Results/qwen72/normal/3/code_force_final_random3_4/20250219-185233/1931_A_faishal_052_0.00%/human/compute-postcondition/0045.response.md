The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `cases` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is [1, 1, `lex - 2`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, [1, `lex - 27`, 26] if `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, or [26, 26, `lex - 52`] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `k` is 3, range is 3**
