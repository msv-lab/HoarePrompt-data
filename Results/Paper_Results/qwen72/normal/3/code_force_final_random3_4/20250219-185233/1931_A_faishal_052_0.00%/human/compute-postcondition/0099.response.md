Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the element 26, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive).**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since the initial value of `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, subtracting 26 from `lex` results in a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged.
