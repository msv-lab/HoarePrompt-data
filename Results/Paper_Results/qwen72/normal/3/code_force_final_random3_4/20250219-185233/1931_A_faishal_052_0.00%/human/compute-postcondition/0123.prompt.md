Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `arr` is an empty list, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, and `range` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[26]` and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `range` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 27`. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 77, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 24, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 24 and less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 50, `arr` is `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 27`. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` is greater than 77, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
