Output State: **`cases` is 0, `i` is `cases - 1`, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is a sorted list with elements appended based on the value of `lex` for each iteration.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `cases` is now 0, as the loop has completed all the iterations it was supposed to run.
- The variable `i` is equal to `cases - 1`, meaning it has reached the last index of the loop (since the loop starts at 0 and ends at `cases - 1`).
- The variable `j` is 2, as it is the last value it reaches in the inner loop.
- The variable `k` is 3, as it is the last value it reaches in the final loop that prints the characters.
- The variable `range` is still 3, as it is a constant in the loop.
- The variable `lex` is an input integer, which is the value provided for the current test case.
- The variable `arr` is a sorted list that contains the elements appended during the loop based on the value of `lex` for each iteration. The list is sorted in ascending order and contains three elements, which are then printed as characters.
