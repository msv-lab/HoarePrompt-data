The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. The initial state specifies different conditions for the value of `lex` and the corresponding values of `arr`. However, the specific value of `lex` is not provided, so we will consider each possible condition and update the state accordingly.

1. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25:
   - `arr` is `[1, 1]`
   - `lex` is `lex - 1`
   - After `arr.append(1)`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1, 1]`

2. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51:
   - `arr` is `[26, 1]`
   - `lex` is `lex - 27`
   - After `arr.append(1)`, `arr` becomes `[26, 1, 1]`

3. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 77:
   - `arr` is `[26, 26]`
   - `lex` is `lex - 26`
   - After `arr.append(1)`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26, 1]`

4. If `lex` is greater than 77:
   - `arr` is `[26, 26]`
   - `lex` is `lex - 26`
   - After `arr.append(1)`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26, 1]`

The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `range` are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` is `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex` is greater than 51.**
