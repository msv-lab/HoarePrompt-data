Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value of a word.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then iterates twice (for the first two letters) and checks if `lex` is less than or equal to 26. If so, it appends 1 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 1. This is incorrect because it should append the smallest possible value that fits the remaining `lex` and not always 1.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26. This is also incorrect because it should handle the case where `lex` is between 27 and 51 more carefully.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26. This is incorrect for the same reason as above.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining `lex` value to `arr`.

3. **Sorting and Printing**:
   - The program sorts `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - It then prints the corresponding letters by converting the positions in `arr` to their respective ASCII values and adding 96 (since 'a' is at position 1 and its ASCII value is 97).

4. **Issues**:
   - The logic for appending values to `arr` is flawed. It should handle the cases where `lex` is less than or equal to 26, between 27 and 51, and greater than 51 more carefully to ensure the correct values are appended.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `lex` is exactly 26 or 52. For example, for `lex = 26`, it should append 26, 1, 1 (which is "azz") but it appends 1, 1, 24 (which is "aav").
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `lex` is between 27 and 51. For example, for `lex = 51`, it should append 25, 26, 1 (which is "yzz") but it appends 26, 26, 1 (which is "zzb").

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should try to use the smallest possible values for the first two letters and the remaining value for the third letter.
   - We can achieve this by:
     - Subtracting the largest possible value (26) from `lex` and appending 26 to `arr` until `lex` is less than or equal to 26.
     - Then, append the remaining value to `arr`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
