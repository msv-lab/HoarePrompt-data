Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 26.**

Explanation: The code snippet `lex = lex - 26` is executed, which updates the value of `lex` by subtracting 26 from its current value. Since the initial state specifies that if `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26, and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 26, this condition is met, and the value of `lex` is updated accordingly. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
