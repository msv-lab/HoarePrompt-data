Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `arr` is defined based on the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`.
     - If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr` is `[1, lex - 27, 26]`.
     - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `range` is 3.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `arr[k]`:**
   - Since `k` is 0, we need to determine the value of `arr[0]` based on the value of `lex`.

4. **Evaluate `arr[0]` Based on `lex`:**
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`, so `arr[0]` is 1.
   - If `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52, `arr` is `[1, lex - 27, 26]`, so `arr[0]` is 1.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`, so `arr[0]` is 26.

5. **Calculate the Character to be Printed:**
   - The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
   - The ASCII value of 'a' is 97, so `chr(96 + 1)` is 'a'.
   - The ASCII value of 'z' is 122, so `chr(96 + 26)` is 'z'.
   - Therefore, the character printed will be:
     - 'a' if `lex` is less than or equal to 25.
     - 'a' if `lex` is greater than 25 but less than 52.
     - 'z' if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline is added after the character is printed.

Output: **'a' (if lex is less than or equal to 51) or 'z' (if lex is greater than or equal to 52)**
