The `arr.sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `arr` is a list with `lex` appended to it, and `lex` is an input integer. The sorting operation will change the order of the elements in `arr`, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list with `lex` appended to it, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, and `lex` is an input integer.**
