Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains an additional element 1, and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 1, with the new value of `lex` being less than or equal to 25. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the element 26, and `lex` is updated to `lex` minus 26.***
