Output State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `range` is 3, `lex` is the same as before, and `arr` is sorted in ascending order.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variables `cases`, `i`, `j`, `range`, and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `k` has been incremented to 3, which is the end value of the loop's range. The array `arr` is still sorted in ascending order, and no other changes have been made to the variables outside the loop.
