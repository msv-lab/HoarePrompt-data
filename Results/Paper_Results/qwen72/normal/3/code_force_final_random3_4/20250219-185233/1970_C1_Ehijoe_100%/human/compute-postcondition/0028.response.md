Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True. `ends` is a list containing all the keys from `nodes` that have exactly one element in their associated list.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` remains unchanged, `i` remains `n-2`, `nodes` still contains the same number of keys (at least `n-1`), `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, and `ends` now contains all the keys from `nodes` that represent leaf nodes (i.e., nodes with exactly one neighbor).
