Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends` (`s`), the first element in the list `nodes[s]` (`curr`), and the first element in the list `nodes[prev]` (`curr`), `prev` is now the first element in the list `nodes[s]` (`curr`), `curr` is now the first element in the list `nodes[prev]` and must not be equal to `e`.**
