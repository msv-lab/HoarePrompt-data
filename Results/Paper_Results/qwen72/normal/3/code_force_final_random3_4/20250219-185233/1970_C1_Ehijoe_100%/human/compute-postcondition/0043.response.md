Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least `n-1` keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of `ends` (`s`), the first element in the list `nodes[s]` (`curr`), and the first element in the list `nodes[prev]` (`curr`), `prev` is now equal to the first element in the list `nodes[s]` (`curr`), `curr` is now the first element in the list `nodes[prev]` and must not be equal to `e`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tree.append(curr)` adds the value of `curr` to the list `tree`.
- `curr` is the first element in the list `nodes[prev]` and must not be equal to `e`.
- `prev` is the first element in the list `nodes[s]`.
- `tree` initially contains `s` and `curr` (the first element in `nodes[s]`).
- After the code execution, `tree` now contains `s`, `curr` (the first element in `nodes[s]`), and the new `curr` (the first element in `nodes[prev]`).

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
