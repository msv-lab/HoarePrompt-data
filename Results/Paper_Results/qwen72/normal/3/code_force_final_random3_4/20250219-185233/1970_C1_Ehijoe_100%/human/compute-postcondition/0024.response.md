Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least two keys, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True. If the list associated with `key` in `nodes` has exactly one element, `ends` is a list containing the `key`. Otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list.***
