Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n, the tree is represented by a list of n-1 edges, where each edge is a tuple (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The starting node is `t`. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is True. `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

The code initializes `nodes` as a `defaultdict` with `list` as the default factory. This means that `nodes` will automatically create a new list for any key that is accessed but not yet present in the dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.
