Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key in `nodes` corresponds to a node in the tree, and the value for each key is a list containing the node's neighbors. Each node's list will contain the correct number of neighbors as per the tree structure, and the tree will have exactly two leaves. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is True. `ends` is an empty list.** 

The variable `ends` is now an empty list, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
