The function `func_1` accepts parameters that define a tree and a starting node. The tree is represented by a list of `n-1` edges, where each edge is a tuple `(u, v)` with `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n`, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The starting node is an integer `u_1` such that `1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n`. The function returns the other leaf node of the tree, starting from the node `u_1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tree represented by a list of n-1 edges and a starting node u_1. It returns the other leaf node of the tree, starting from u_1.**
