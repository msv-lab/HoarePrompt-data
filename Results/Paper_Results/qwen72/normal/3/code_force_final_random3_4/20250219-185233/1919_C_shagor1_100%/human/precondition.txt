The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array a, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
