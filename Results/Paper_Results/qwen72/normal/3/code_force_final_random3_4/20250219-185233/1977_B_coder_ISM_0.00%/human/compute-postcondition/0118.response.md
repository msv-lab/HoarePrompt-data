Postcondition: ***`nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing a bit of `x` from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i + 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is set to '-1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and `s[0]` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0. In all other cases, `flag` remains 1 and the state of `s` is unchanged.***
