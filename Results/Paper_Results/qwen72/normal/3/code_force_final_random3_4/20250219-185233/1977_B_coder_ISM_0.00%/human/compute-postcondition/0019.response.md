Output State: **`i` is 29, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all 30 iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have reached its final value of 29 (since the loop runs from 0 to 29, inclusive). The variable `length` remains unchanged at 30. The list `s` will contain 30 elements, where each element is either '1' or '0'. These elements represent the binary digits of the integer `x`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost bit) to the most significant bit (leftmost bit). If a particular bit in `x` is set (i.e., it is 1), the corresponding position in `s` will be '1'. If the bit is not set (i.e., it is 0), the corresponding position in `s` will be '0'.
