The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `29`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 29
- `length` is 30

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be reset to a value that is less than `29`. However, since the loop is defined to iterate from `0` to `28` (inclusive), the next iteration would start with `i` being `0` again if the loop were to restart. But in a typical for loop, once `i` reaches the end condition, the loop terminates and does not restart.

Given the loop definition, the loop will not execute again because `i` is already 29, which is equal to the upper bound of the loop (29 is not less than 29).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which does not occur) remains:
State: **`i` is 29, `length` is 30**
