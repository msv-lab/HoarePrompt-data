The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `length`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `length` is 30. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `length` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `x` is an input integer. If the least significant bit (bit at position 0) of `x` is 1, `s` is a list containing the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing the string '0'.**
