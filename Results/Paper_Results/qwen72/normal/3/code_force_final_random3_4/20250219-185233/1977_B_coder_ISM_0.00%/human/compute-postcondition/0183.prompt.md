Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an empty list, the loop has processed all elements from index 1 to 29. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'. The final value of `flag` will be determined as described in the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list with 30 elements. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is 1, the last element of `s` is '1', and the loop has processed all elements from index 1 to 29. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'. The final value of `flag` will be determined as described in the initial state. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is 0, the last element of `s` is '0', and the loop has processed all elements from index 1 to 30. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'. The final value of `flag` will be determined as described in the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list with 31 elements. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is 1, the last element of `s` is '1', and the second last element of `s` is '1' if the bit at position 0 in `x` is 1. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is 0, the last element of `s` is '0', and the second last element of `s` is '0'. The loop has processed all elements from index 1 to 30.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list with 32 elements. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is 1, the last element of `s` is '1', and the second last element of `s` is '1'. If the bit at position 0 in `x` is 0, the last element of `s` is '0', and the second last element of `s` is '0'. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
