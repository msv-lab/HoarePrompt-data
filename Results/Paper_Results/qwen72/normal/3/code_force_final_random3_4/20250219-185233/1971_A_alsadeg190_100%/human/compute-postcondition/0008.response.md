The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` is an input integer such that 1 <= x <= 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 1, and `x` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`x` is an input integer such that 1 <= x <= 9, `i` is 1, and `y` is an input integer. If `x` < `y`, the condition `x` < `y` holds. Otherwise, `x` >= `y` holds.**
