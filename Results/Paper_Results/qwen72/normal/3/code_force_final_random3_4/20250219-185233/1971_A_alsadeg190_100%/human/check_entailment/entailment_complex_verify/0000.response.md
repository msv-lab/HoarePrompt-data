Reasoning: The original assessment states that the program does not explicitly handle the case where `x` and `y` are equal, and this could be a potential bug in more complex scenarios. However, the program's logic is actually correct for the given problem description. The problem requires printing the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`. When `x` equals `y`, both the minimum and maximum are the same value, and the program correctly prints `x` and `y` in this case. The `if x < y` condition handles the case where `x` is less than `y`, and the `else` condition handles the case where `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, which includes the equality case. Therefore, the program is logically correct and meets the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
