You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

    4 8
    1 4

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `x` from the input, and for each value of `x`, it reads `x` pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (each pair on a new line). For each pair, it prints the two integers in ascending order. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values have been processed and printed, but no changes are made to any external variables or state.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `x` times, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - Inside the loop, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` from the input.
   - This is done using `input().split()` to split the input string into two parts and `map(int, ...)` to convert them to integers.

3. **Comparing and Outputting**:
   - The program checks if `x` is less than `y`.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - If `x` is not less than `y` (i.e., `x` is greater than or equal to `y`), it prints `y` followed by `x`.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct as it prints two integers per test case, which matches the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where `x` and `y` are equal, as it will print the same number twice.
   - The constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) are respected, and the program will work for any valid input within these constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
