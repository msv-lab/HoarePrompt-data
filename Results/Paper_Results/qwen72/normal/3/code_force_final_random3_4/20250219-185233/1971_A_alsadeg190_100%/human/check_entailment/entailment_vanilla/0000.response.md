### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func()` is defined to handle the problem.

2. **Reading the Number of Test Cases**:
   - The first line of the input is read using `int(input())` and stored in the variable `x`. This correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.

3. **Looping Through Test Cases**:
   - A for loop is used to iterate `t` times, which is correct as it matches the problem description.

4. **Reading Each Test Case**:
   - Inside the loop, the input for each test case is read using `input().split()`, which splits the input into two space-separated integers. These integers are then converted to `int` using `map(int, ...)` and stored in the variables `x` and `y`. This is correct and matches the problem description.

5. **Finding Minimum and Maximum**:
   - The program checks if `x` is less than `y` using an if-else statement.
   - If `x < y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - If `x >= y`, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
   - This logic correctly outputs the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case on a new line, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find and print the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
