Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, the function processes two non-negative integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 9. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
