### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `x` times, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - Inside the loop, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` from the input.
   - This is done using `input().split()` to split the input string into two parts and `map(int, ...)` to convert them to integers.

3. **Comparing and Outputting**:
   - The program checks if `x` is less than `y`.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - If `x` is not less than `y` (i.e., `x` is greater than or equal to `y`), it prints `y` followed by `x`.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct as it prints two integers per test case, which matches the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where `x` and `y` are equal, as it will print the same number twice.
   - The constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) are respected, and the program will work for any valid input within these constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
