Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that has `n` elements, `count` is 1, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(num % x, num % y)` and the value 1, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values `(num % x, num % y)`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_key = num % x, num % y` updates the value of `current_key` to a tuple containing the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.
- The values of `num % x` and `num % y` are already stored in `r_x` and `r_y` respectively, so `current_key` is now `(r_x, r_y)`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
