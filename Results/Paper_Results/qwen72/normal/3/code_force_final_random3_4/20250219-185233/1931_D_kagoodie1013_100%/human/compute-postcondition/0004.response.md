The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, and `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` is a list of `n` integers. For the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least one element, and `num` should be the first element in `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases` where `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least one element, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `arr`**
