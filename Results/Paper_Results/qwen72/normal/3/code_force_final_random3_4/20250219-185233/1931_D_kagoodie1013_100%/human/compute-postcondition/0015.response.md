Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least two elements, `count` is 1, `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the key `current_key` with a value of 2, `num` is the second element in `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple (`-num % x`, `num % y`).**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of the key `current_key` in the dictionary `residue_map` by incrementing it by 1.
- Initially, `residue_map` contains the key `current_key` with a value of 1.
- After the code execution, the value of `current_key` in `residue_map` is now 2.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
