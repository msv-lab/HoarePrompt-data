Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least 2 elements, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` and the value `1`, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `r_y = num % y` updates the value of `r_y` to be the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `num` is the second element of `arr`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
