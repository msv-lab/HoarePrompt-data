Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array for each test case. A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

To determine if the program is correct, let's analyze the logic and the states provided:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to create a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(a\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a `count` variable to 0.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the number of elements that have the same remainders when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates:
     - `r_x` which is \(-num \mod x\).
     - `r_y` which is `num \mod y`.
   - It increments the `count` by the number of elements already in `residue_map` that have the same remainders \((r_x, r_y)\).
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current remainders \((num \mod x, num \mod y)\).

3. **Output:**
   - The function appends the `count` to the `results` list for each test case.
   - Finally, it prints the `results` list, which contains the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Condition 1: \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\):**
  - For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), the remainders of \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) when divided by \(x\) must sum to 0 or \(x\). This is equivalent to checking if \((a_i \mod x) + (a_j \mod x) \equiv 0 \mod x\), which simplifies to \((a_i \mod x) \equiv -a_j \mod x\).

- **Condition 2: \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\):**
  - For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), the remainders of \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) when divided by \(y\) must be the same. This is equivalent to checking if \((a_i \mod y) \equiv (a_j \mod y)\).

### Correctness of the Program:

- The program correctly calculates the remainders for each element in the array.
- It uses a dictionary to count the number of elements that have the same remainders \((r_x, r_y)\).
- However, the key used in the dictionary is \((num \mod x, num \mod y)\), which is not the same as \((r_x, r_y)\). The correct key should be \((-num \mod x, num \mod y)\) to match the conditions for a beautiful pair.

### Conclusion:

The program is almost correct but has a small mistake in the key used for the dictionary. The key should be \((-num \mod x, num \mod y)\) instead of \((num \mod x, num \mod y)\). This mistake will cause the program to count pairs incorrectly.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
