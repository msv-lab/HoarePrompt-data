The value of `count` is incremented by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the `residue_map` dictionary, or by 0 if the key does not exist. Since the `residue_map` dictionary contains the key `(num % x, num % y)` with the value 2, and `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y`, the key `(r_x, r_y)` will match `(num % x, num % y)` in the dictionary, and `count` will be incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that has `n` elements, `count` is 3, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(num % x, num % y)` and the value 2, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values `(num % x, num % y)`.**
