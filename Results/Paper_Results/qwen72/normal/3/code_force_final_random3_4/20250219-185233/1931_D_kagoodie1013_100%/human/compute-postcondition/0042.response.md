Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` is an integer (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), `arr` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that must have at least 3 elements, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1` plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` and the value `2`, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- Given that `residue_map` has the key `current_key` with a value of `2`, and `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)`, which is the same as `(r_x, r_y)`, the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` is `2`.
- Therefore, `count` is incremented by `2`, making it `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1 + 2`.
- All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
