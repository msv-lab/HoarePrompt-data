Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input in a batch and processes it for multiple test cases, which is in line with the problem description.

2. **Residue Calculation**: For each number in the array, the program calculates two residues:
   - `r_x = -num % x` for the condition `a_i + a_j is divisible by x`.
   - `r_y = num % y` for the condition `a_i - a_j is divisible by y`.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs that satisfy the conditions. For each number `num` in the array:
   - It checks if there is a previously seen number with residues `(r_x, r_y)` and adds the count to the total `count`.
   - It then updates the dictionary with the current number's residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The logic ensures that for each pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (where \(i < j\)), the conditions \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\) are checked efficiently using the residue map. The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
