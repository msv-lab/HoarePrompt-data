Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `k + Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Max`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int((n - Min * Max) / k), k)`, `number` is `Min`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - Max`.
- All other variables (`rep`, `n`, `t`, `tab`, `i`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `k + Min * Max` is still valid, but `k` has been updated, so the new condition is `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to `(k - Max) + Min * Max`.
- `t` is still greater than 0 and decremented by 1.
- `tab` still contains two string representations of `number`.
- `i` remains `None`.
- `Min` and `Max` are still defined by their respective expressions, which depend on the updated value of `k`.
- `number` remains `Min`.
