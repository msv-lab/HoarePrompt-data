Output State: **`n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` from its previous value, `k` is a positive integer, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder variable, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list with one element, which is the string representation of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is updated based on the condition: if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `number` is equal to `Min` and `k` is updated to `k - Max`; otherwise, `number` is equal to `Max`, `k` is updated to `k - Min`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**
