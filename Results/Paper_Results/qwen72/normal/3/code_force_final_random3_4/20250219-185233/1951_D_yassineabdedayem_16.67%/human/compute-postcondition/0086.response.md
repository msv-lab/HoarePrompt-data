Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is updated to either `k - Max` or `k - Min` and must be greater than zero, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list with three elements, where the first element is the string representation of the initial `number`, the second element is the string representation of the current `number`, and the third element is the string representation of the current `number` after the update, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, `number` is now `Min`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max`.**
