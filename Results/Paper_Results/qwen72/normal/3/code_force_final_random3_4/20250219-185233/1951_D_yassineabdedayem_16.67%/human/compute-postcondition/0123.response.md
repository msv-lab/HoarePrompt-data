Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `k` is `k - max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - Max`, where `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
