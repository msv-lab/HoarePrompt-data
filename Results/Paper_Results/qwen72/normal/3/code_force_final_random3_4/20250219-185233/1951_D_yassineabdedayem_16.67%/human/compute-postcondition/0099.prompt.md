Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rep` is 60 or the loop condition (`n != 0 and k > 0 and n >= k`) is no longer satisfied, `n` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by the number of loop iterations, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the numbers appended during each iteration, `i` is `None`, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a number, `i` is the first element of `tab`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of numbers, `i` is the second element of `tab`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tab` is a list containing at least three string representations of numbers, `i` is the third element of `tab`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
