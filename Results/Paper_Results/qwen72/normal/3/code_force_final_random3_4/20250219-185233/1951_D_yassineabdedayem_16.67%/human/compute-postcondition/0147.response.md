Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `rep` is 60 or less.
- `n` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`.
- `k` is 0.
- `t` is 0 or a positive integer.
- `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is the second element in `tab`.
- `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
- `n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed.

### Analysis:
1. **`tab` List**: The list `tab` contains string representations of `number` for each iteration and must have at least 2 elements. This means `tab` has at least 2 string elements.
2. **`i` Variable**: `i` is the second element in `tab`. Since `tab` has at least 2 elements, `i` will be the string representation of the second element in `tab`.
3. **`print(i, end=' ')`**: This statement prints the value of `i` followed by a space.

### Determining the Value of `i`:
- Since `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` and it has at least 2 elements, `i` will be the string representation of the second element in `tab`.

### Final Output:
The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of the list `tab` followed by a space.

Output: **[second element of tab] **

Where `[second element of tab]` is the string representation of the second element in the list `tab`.
