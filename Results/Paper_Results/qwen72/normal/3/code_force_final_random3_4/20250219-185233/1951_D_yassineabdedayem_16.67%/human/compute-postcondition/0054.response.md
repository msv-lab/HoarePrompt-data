Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the integer values read from the input, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder variable, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration, `i` is the last element in `tab` if `k` is 0, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.**
