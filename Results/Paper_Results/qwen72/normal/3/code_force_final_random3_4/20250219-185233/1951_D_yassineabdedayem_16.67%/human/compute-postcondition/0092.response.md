To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(tab))` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`rep` is 60 or the loop condition (`n != 0 and k > 0 and n >= k`) is no longer satisfied**:
   - This indicates that the loop ran for 60 iterations or until the condition `n != 0 and k > 0 and n >= k` was no longer true.

2. **`n` is the final value after all iterations of the loop**:
   - The value of `n` after the loop is not explicitly given, but it is the result of the loop's operations.

3. **`k` is 0**:
   - The value of `k` is explicitly stated to be 0 after the loop.

4. **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by the number of loop iterations**:
   - `t` starts greater than 0 and is decremented by the number of iterations. If the loop ran for 60 iterations, `t` would be `t - 60`.

5. **`tab` is a list containing the string representations of the numbers appended during each iteration**:
   - This means that during each iteration of the loop, a string representation of some number was appended to the list `tab`.

6. **`i` is `None`**:
   - The value of `i` is not relevant to the `print(len(tab))` statement.

7. **`Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively**:
   - Since `k` is 0, `n // k` would result in a division by zero error, which suggests that these values might not be computed or are not relevant to the `print(len(tab))` statement.

8. **`number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop**:
   - The value of `number` is not explicitly given, but it is the last value assigned during the loop.

Given the above conditions, the key point is to determine the length of the list `tab`. Since `tab` is a list that contains the string representations of numbers appended during each iteration of the loop, and the loop ran for 60 iterations (or until the condition was no longer satisfied), the length of `tab` will be the number of iterations the loop completed.

Since the loop ran for 60 iterations (as `rep` is 60), the length of `tab` will be 60.

Output: **60**
