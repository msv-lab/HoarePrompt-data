To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `tab`. The loop will execute if `tab` is not empty. The other variables mentioned in the state do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

Given the state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is a placeholder variable
- `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met)
- `k` is a positive integer
- `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration
- `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively
- `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration
- `k` is 0

The critical state to ensure the loop executes is that `tab` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `tab` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met), `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met, `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of `number`, `i` is the first element in `tab`, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.**
