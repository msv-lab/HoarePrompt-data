The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `tab`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If `tab` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` contains at least two string representations of `number`, and `i` is the second element in `tab`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element in `tab`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met), `k` is 0, `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met, `tab` is a list containing at least three string representations of `number`, `i` is the third element in `tab`, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.**
