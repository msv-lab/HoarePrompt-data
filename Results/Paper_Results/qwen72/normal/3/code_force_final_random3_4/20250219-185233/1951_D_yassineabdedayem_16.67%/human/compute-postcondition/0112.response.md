Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is an empty list, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`, `number` is `Min`, `k` is `k - max(n // k, k)`, and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `Max` from it. Since `Max` is defined as `max(n // k, k)`, and given that `Max` equals `k`, the new value of `k` becomes `k - k`, which is 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
