Output State: **`tab` is a list containing the string representations of the numbers appended during each iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab` (or `None` if `tab` is empty), `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by the number of loop iterations, `Min` and `Max` remain unchanged, `number` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `tab` will contain all the string representations of the numbers that were appended during the loop. The variable `i` will hold the last element of `tab` (or `None` if `tab` is empty). The variables `n` and `k` will remain unchanged from their values at the start of the loop. The variable `t` will be greater than 0 but will have been decremented by the number of times the loop executed. The variables `Min` and `Max` will also remain unchanged, as will the variable `number`.
