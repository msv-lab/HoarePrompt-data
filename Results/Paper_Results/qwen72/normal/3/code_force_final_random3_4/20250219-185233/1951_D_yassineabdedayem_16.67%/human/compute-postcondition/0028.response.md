To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to verify the conditions in the loop head:
- `n != 0`
- `k > 0`
- `rep < 60`
- `n >= k`

From the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `_` is a placeholder variable (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`
- `k` is a positive integer
- `rep` is 2, which is less than 60
- `tab` is a list (not relevant to the loop head)
- `Min` and `Max` are updated based on the conditions, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`

Given that `rep` is 2 and less than 60, and `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time is `n` and `k` to maintain the condition `n >= k`.

Since `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` in the loop body, and `Min` and `Max` are derived from `n` and `k`, we need to ensure that after this update, `n` is still greater than or equal to `k`. However, without specific values for `n`, `k`, `Min`, and `Max`, we cannot definitively adjust `n` and `k`. Therefore, we must assume that the update to `n` and `k` in the loop body will still satisfy the condition `n >= k`.

Thus, the state can remain the same, as the conditions are already met for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`**
