Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`.
- The initial state specifies that `tab` already contains the string representation of `number`.
- After executing the code, `tab` now contains two elements: the string representation of `number` and the same string representation of `number` appended again.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged.
