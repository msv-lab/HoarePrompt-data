Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rep` is 0, `n` and `k` are the new values read from the input, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is an empty list, `i` is `None` (since `k` is 0 or the loop condition is no longer satisfied), `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, `number` is 0. If `k` is 0, `i` is the last element of `tab` (or `None` if `tab` is empty), and `Min` and `Max` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is not 0, and `n` and `k` are the new values read from the input.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rep` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `rep` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `rep` is 3, `n` is a positive integer and is now equal to `n - Min * Max`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing three string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
