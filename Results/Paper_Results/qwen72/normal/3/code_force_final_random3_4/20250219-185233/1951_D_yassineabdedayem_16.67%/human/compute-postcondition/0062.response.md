Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are updated to integer values read from the input, `n` must be a non-zero integer and `k` must be a positive integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder variable, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration, and `number` is 0. Additionally, either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**
