Output State: **`rep` is 3, `n` is a positive integer and is now equal to `n - Min * Max`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing three string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min((n - Min * Max) // k, k)`, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is set to `Max`.**

The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
