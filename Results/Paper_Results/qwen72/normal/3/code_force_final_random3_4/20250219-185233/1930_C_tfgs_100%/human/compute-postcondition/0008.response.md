Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is increased by `i + 1` for all `0 ≤ i < n`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the integer `t` remains within its initial range, the integer `n` remains within its initial range, and the list `a` still contains `n` integers. The index `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration. Each element in the list `a` has been incremented by its index plus one (`i + 1`), where `i` is the position of the element in the list starting from 0.
