Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is increased by `i + 1` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(set(a))` converts the list `a` into a set to remove any duplicate elements and then converts it back into a list.
- The length of the new list `a` is now the number of unique elements from the original list, but the value of `n` remains the same as the initial state, which is the length of the original list.
- The variable `i` is still `n-1`, and `n` must still be greater than 0.
- The elements in the list `a` are now unique, but the precondition that each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is increased by `i + 1` for all `0 ≤ i < n` still holds, although the list `a` now contains fewer elements.
- The `counter` is still a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, but since `a` now contains only unique elements, each element in `a` will have a count of 1 in the `counter`.
- The value of `cur` remains 0.
