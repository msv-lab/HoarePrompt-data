### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program correctly modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]` for all `0 â‰¤ i < n`. This step simulates the insertion of `a[i] + i` into the set `S` and the subsequent deletion of `a[i]` from `a`.

3. **Counting and Sorting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element in `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the set in descending order. This step ensures that the elements are in the correct order for constructing the lexicographically largest array `b`.

4. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the final array `b`.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - For each element, it also checks if there are gaps between the current element and the previous element (if any) and fills these gaps with the largest possible values that are not already in `ans`.
   - The variable `cnt` keeps track of the number of elements that need to be added to fill the gaps, and `cur` keeps track of the number of elements that can be added to the current position.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After the main loop, if there are still elements to be added (`cnt > 0`), it appends the remaining elements in a decreasing sequence to `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces, which represents the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly follows the problem description and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case. The logic for handling duplicates and filling gaps is sound, and the final output is correct for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
