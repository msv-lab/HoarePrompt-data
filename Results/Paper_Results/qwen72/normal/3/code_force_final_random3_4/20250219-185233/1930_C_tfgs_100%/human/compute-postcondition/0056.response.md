Output State: **`adv` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `adv - 1`, `ans` has `adv` new elements appended: the elements are `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `cur` is `cur - adv`.**

The value of `cur` is updated to `cur - adv`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions for `adv`, `j`, `ans`, and `cnt` are still valid.
