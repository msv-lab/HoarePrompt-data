Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[0]` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
