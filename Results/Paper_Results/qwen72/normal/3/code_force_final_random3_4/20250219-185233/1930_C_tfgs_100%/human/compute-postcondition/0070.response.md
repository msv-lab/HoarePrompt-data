The function `func_1` does not explicitly define parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function processes a series of test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases where each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Given these constraints, the function likely processes each test case and returns a result based on the input array `a` for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the input array `a`.**
