### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program modifies each element of the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]`. This step is correct because it aligns with the problem's requirement to insert `a[i] + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Removing Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the set in descending order. This step is correct because the set `S` should only contain unique elements, and the final array `b` should be sorted in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes a list `ans` to store the elements of the array `b`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and constructs `ans` by adding elements and ensuring that the array is lexicographically largest.
   - The `cur` variable keeps track of the number of elements that can be added to `ans` without violating the uniqueness constraint.
   - The `cnt` variable keeps track of the remaining number of elements to be added to `ans` to reach the length `n`.

5. **Handling Duplicates and Gaps:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are duplicates in the modified array `a` by using the `Counter` and ensuring that the elements are added in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order.
   - It fills in the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted array to ensure that the final array `b` is as large as possible.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which is the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
  - **Modification of Array `a`:** The modification step `a[i] += i + 1` is correct and aligns with the problem statement.
  - **Counting and Removing Duplicates:** Using `Counter` and converting `a` to a set to remove duplicates is a valid approach. Sorting the set in descending order ensures that the elements are in the correct order for the lexicographically largest array.
  - **Constructing `ans`:** The logic for constructing `ans` is intricate but correct. It ensures that the array `ans` is lexicographically largest by:
    - Filling gaps between consecutive elements to maximize the values.
    - Handling duplicates by decrementing the count in the `Counter` and adjusting the `cur` variable accordingly.
  - **Final Output:** The program correctly prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where all elements in `a` are the same by correctly filling in the gaps.
  - It also handles cases where the elements in `a` are already in a form that results in a large number of unique elements.

- **Performance:**
  - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints given (up to `3 * 10^5` elements in total across all test cases).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and produces the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case. The only minor issue mentioned in the original assessment (calling `func_1` before it is defined) has been corrected.

### Final:
Final: **True**
