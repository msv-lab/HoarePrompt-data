Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`).
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n + r + 1` must be greater than 3.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `r` is determined by the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. This condition simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} > i \cdot n
     \]
     Dividing both sides by `n`:
     \[
     \frac{n + 1}{2} > i
     \]
     Therefore, `i` must be less than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\). The largest `i` that satisfies this condition is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1\), but since `i` is initialized to `n`, the condition will not hold for `i = n` unless \(n = 1\). For \(n > 1\), `r` will be the largest integer less than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\).
   - `j` is explicitly set to 3.
   - The condition `n + r + 1 > 3` must hold. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `r` is at least 1 (for \(n > 1\)), this condition will always be true.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is:
     ```python
     print(1, j, end=' ')
     ```
   - `1` is a constant integer.
   - `j` is explicitly set to 3.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output the integer 1 followed by the value of `j` (which is 3), separated by a space, and ending with a space.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1 3 **
