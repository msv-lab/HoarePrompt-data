Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`).
   - `j` is initialized to 1.
   - `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is printing three values: `1`, `j`, and an empty string with a space at the end (`end=' '`).
   - The value `1` is a constant integer.
   - The value `j` is initialized to 1 in the initial state.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `j` is explicitly given as 1, the print statement will output `1` followed by `1` and a space.

Output: **1 1**
