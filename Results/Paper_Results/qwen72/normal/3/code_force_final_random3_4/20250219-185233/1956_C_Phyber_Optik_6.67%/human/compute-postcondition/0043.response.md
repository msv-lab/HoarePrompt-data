Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`), `j` is `n + r + 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `n`.
- The value of `r` is determined based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. If this condition holds for all `i`, then `r` is `n`. Otherwise, `r` is the largest `i` where the condition holds.
- The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`. For each iteration:
  - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop prints `1` followed by `j` and then the range of numbers from 1 to `n`.
  - If `j` is greater than `n`, the loop prints `2` followed by `j % n` and then the range of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be `n + r + 1`, which is the value that causes the loop to terminate.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
