Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + i * n` and `r` is 1. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` is `n + i * n` and `r` is 0.***
