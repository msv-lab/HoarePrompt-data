Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters but reads input from the user to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. The function computes a sum and a value `r` based on the input `n`, and prints the sum and `n + r`. It then prints a series of lines, each containing a type (1 or 2), a value, and a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` set to 0, `n` set to the last positive integer input, `i` set to `n + 1`, `j` set to `n + r`, `r` set to the last computed value, and `sum` set to the total computed sum for the last test case. **
