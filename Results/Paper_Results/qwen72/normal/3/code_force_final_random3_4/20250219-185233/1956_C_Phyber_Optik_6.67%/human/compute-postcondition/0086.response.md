Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer between 0 and 499, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains greater than 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`i`**: Remains `n + 1`, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`j`**: After all iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `n + r`. This is because the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`, and the final value of `j` will be `n + r` after the loop completes.
- **`r`**: Remains the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`sum`**: The value of `sum` is calculated based on the loop's logic. It is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false. This value is not directly modified by the loop, but it is computed based on the conditions within the loop.

The loop iterates `n + r` times, and the final value of `j` is `n + r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `r`) remain unchanged, and `sum` is computed based on the conditions within the loop.
