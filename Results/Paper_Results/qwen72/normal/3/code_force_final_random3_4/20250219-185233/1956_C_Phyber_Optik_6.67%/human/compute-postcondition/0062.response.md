The value of `sum` is incremented by `i * n`. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, so `i * n` is `(n + 1) * n`. The previous value of `sum` is either `n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` or `n * n + (n + 1) * n` depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` is:

- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` was `n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` and becomes `n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) * n`.
- Otherwise, `sum` was `n * n + (n + 1) * n` and becomes `n * n + (n + 1) * n + (n + 1) * n`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `r` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n + 1` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` otherwise `r` is 0, `sum` is `n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` otherwise `sum` is `n * n + (n + 1) * n + (n + 1) * n`.**
