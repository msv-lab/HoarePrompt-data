Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`).
   - `j` is 1.
   - `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Condition for `r`:**
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} > i \cdot n
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by `n`:
     \[
     \frac{n + 1}{2} > i
     \]
   - This means `i` must be less than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\).
   - `r` is the largest `i` that satisfies this condition, which is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1\). However, if `n` is 1, then `r` is 1 because the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

3. **Analyzing the Condition for `j`:**
   - The initial state says `j` is 1, but then it also states `j` is greater than `n`.
   - This is a contradiction because `n` is greater than 0, and `j` cannot be both 1 and greater than `n` at the same time.
   - Therefore, the initial state is inconsistent, and we need to clarify which condition to use. For the purpose of this task, let's assume the correct condition is `j` is 1 (since it is explicitly stated first).

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is:
     \[
     \text{print(2, j \% n, end=' ')}
     \]
   - `2` is a constant integer.
   - `j % n` is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.
   - Since `j` is 1, `j % n` will be 1 for any `n` greater than 1.
   - The `end=' '` argument ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **2 1**
