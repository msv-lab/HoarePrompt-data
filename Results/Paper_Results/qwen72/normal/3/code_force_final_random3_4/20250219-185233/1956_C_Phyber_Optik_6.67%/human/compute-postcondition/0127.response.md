To determine what will be printed by the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
2. `n` is a positive integer.
3. `i` is `n + 1`.
4. `j` is 3.
5. `r` is `n`.
6. `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
7. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

### Analysis:
- The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.
- The value of `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Output:
The code prints all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer)**
