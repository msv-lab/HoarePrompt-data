Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `r` is `n`.
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `j % n`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determine `j % n`:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - The value of `j % n` depends on the value of `n`:
     - If `n` is 1, then `j % n` is `2 % 1`, which is 0.
     - If `n` is 2, then `j % n` is `2 % 2`, which is 0.
     - If `n` is greater than 2, then `j % n` is `2 % n`, which is 2 (since 2 is less than `n`).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `0` if `n` is 1 or 2, and `2` if `n` is greater than 2.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `n`, we need to consider both cases:

- If `n` is 1 or 2, the output will be `2 0`.
- If `n` is greater than 2, the output will be `2 2`.

However, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **2 [j % n] (where [j % n] is 0 if n is 1 or 2, and 2 if n is greater than 2)**
