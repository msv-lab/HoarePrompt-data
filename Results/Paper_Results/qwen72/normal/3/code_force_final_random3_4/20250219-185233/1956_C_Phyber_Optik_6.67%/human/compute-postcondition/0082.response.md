To determine what will be printed by the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 499.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the condition `j <= n + r` is true.
   - If `j` is greater than `n`, the condition `j <= n + r` is false.

2. **Relevant Variables for the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(*range(1, n + 1))` will print all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so the `print` function will print each integer in the sequence separated by spaces.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, the sequence will contain at least one integer.
   - The exact integers printed will depend on the value of `n`, but they will always be the integers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the sequence includes all integers from 1 to n)**
