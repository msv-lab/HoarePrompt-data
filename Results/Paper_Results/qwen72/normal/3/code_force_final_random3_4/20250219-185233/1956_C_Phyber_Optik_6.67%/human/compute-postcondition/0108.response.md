Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is `n + r`.
- `r` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `r` is equal to `n`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n + r`, which simplifies to `n + n` or `2 * n`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum is calculated based on two conditions:
     - For all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, the sum includes `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
     - For all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, the sum includes `i * n`.

3. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The expression `i * n` is `n * (n + 1)` since `i = n + 1`.

4. **Sum Calculation Breakdown:**
   - We need to determine the range of `i` values and which condition each `i` satisfies.
   - For `i = n + 1`, `i * n = n * (n + 1)`.
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * (n + 1)` is never true because `n * (n + 1) // 2` is always less than or equal to `n * (n + 1)`.
   - Therefore, the sum will only include the terms where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

5. **Sum Calculation Simplified:**
   - Since the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` is always true for `i = n + 1`, the sum will be `i * n` for `i = n + 1`.
   - The sum is thus `n * (n + 1)`.

6. **Final Values:**
   - `sum` is `n * (n + 1)`.
   - `n + r` is `n + n` or `2 * n`.

### Output:
The `print(sum, n + r)` statement will print the value of `sum` which is `n * (n + 1)` and the value of `n + r` which is `2 * n`.

Output: **n * (n + 1), 2 * n (where n is the input integer)**
