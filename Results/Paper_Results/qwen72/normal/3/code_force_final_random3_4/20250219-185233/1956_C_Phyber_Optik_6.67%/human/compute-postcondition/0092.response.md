Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `r` is 1, `sum` is 0, and the current value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to 1 (the value of `i`). The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `sum` remain unchanged. The condition that `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` still holds true.
