Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `r` is `n`.
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.
   - Additionally, `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the integer 2, followed by the result of `j % n`, and will end the output with a space.
   - `j` is initially set to 1, but the additional condition states that `j` is greater than `n`.
   - Since `j` is greater than `n`, the value of `j % n` will be the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

4. **Determine the Value of `j % n`:**
   - Given that `j` is greater than `n`, the value of `j % n` will be a positive integer less than `n`.
   - However, the exact value of `j` is not provided, so we can only describe it in terms of `n`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer 2, followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and will end with a space.

Output: **2, j % n (where j % n is the remainder when j is divided by n, and j is greater than n)**
