Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + 3`, `r` is 3, `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `sum` is `n + 2 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains an integer between 0 and 498.
- The value of `n` remains at least 2.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `j` remains `n + 3`.
- The value of `r` remains 3.
- The value of `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Depending on the initial condition, the new value of `sum` is:
  - If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` becomes `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`.
  - If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` becomes `n + 2 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`.
