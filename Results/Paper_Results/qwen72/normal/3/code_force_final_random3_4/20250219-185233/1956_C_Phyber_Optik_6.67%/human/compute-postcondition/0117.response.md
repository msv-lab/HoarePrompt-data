The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n + r + 1`. If `j` is less than `n + r + 1`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is 1.
- `r` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than `n + r + 1`.

Given that `r` is `n`, the condition `j < n + r + 1` simplifies to `j < n + n + 1` or `j < 2n + 1`.

Since `j` is now 2, the loop will execute again if `2 < 2n + 1`, which is always true for any positive integer `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 2, `r` is `n`, and `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.**
