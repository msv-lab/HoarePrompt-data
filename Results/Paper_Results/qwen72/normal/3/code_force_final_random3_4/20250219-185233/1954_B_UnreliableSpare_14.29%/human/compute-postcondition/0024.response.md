Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of Decimal('Infinity') and `cnt`.***
