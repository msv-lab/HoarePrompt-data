Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to the first element, and prints this minimum length. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result to the console. **
