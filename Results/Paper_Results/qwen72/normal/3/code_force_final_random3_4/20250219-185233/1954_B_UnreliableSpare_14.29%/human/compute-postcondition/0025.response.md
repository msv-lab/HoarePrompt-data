To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop head:

1. **Loop Head**: `for i in range(n):`
   - The loop iterates over the range of `n`, which is the length of `arr`.
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

2. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - The sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0.
   - `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False.
   - `val` is the first element of `arr`.
   - If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of Decimal('Infinity') and `cnt`.

3. **Adjustments for the next iteration**:
   - The loop variable `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented to 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 1, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of Decimal('Infinity') and `cnt`.**
