### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Check for Identical Elements**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are identical by iterating through the array and setting a flag `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are identical (`flag` remains `True`), it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. This part of the logic is correct.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity (`Decimal('Infinity')`) and a tuple `(val, cnt)` to track the current value and its count.
   - It iterates through the array, counting the occurrences of the current value `val`.
   - When a different value is encountered, it updates `ans` to the minimum of the current `ans` and the count `cnt`.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the count of the last value.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic for checking if all elements are identical is correct.
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. The program only considers the minimum count of consecutive identical elements, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - To correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove, the program should consider the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the pattern of the array being beautiful. This involves more than just counting consecutive identical elements.

### Example Analysis:
- For the array `[2, 2, 2]`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to make it non-beautiful.
- For the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program prints `1`, which is correct because removing the last `1` makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.
- For the array `[1]`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to make it non-beautiful.
- For the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program prints `3`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `2` because removing the first two `3`s or the last two `3`s makes the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful in all cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the correct approach for breaking the pattern of the array being beautiful.

Final: **False**
