Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array is not entirely composed of the same elements but still meets the criteria of being beautiful. The logic in the program only checks if all elements are the same and then tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program will output `1`, which is correct. However, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 2 1
```
The program will output `1`, but the correct output should be `2`. The array `[1, 2, 2, 1]` is beautiful, and to make it non-beautiful, you need to remove at least two elements (e.g., removing the first and last elements results in `[2, 2]`, which is still beautiful, so you need to remove one more element to make it non-beautiful).

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
