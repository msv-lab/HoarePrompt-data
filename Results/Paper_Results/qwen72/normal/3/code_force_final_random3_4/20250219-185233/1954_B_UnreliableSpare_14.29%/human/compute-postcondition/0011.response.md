Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, `flag` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains True.***
