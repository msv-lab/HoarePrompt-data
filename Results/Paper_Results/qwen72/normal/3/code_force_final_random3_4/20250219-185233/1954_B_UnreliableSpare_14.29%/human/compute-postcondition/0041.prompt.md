You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) for a beautiful array of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val` before encountering a different element, or `n` if all elements are equal to `val`. `ans` is the minimum value between Decimal('Infinity') and the length of the longest prefix of `arr` where all elements are equal to `val` before encountering a different element. If all elements in `arr` are equal to `val`, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: Output:
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value between the previous ans and cnt, and cnt is the number of consecutive elements from the start of arr that are equal to val)
    #State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val` before encountering a different element, or `n` if all elements are equal to `val`, and `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `flag` is True, `cnt` is `n` because all elements in `arr` are equal to `val`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `test_cases`. It returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether the corresponding inner list in `test_cases` is a beautiful array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
