Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - The sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5.
   - `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0.
   - `flag` is True.
   - `val` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val`, which is `n` because all elements are equal to `val`.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The values of `t`, `arr`, `i`, `flag`, `val`, `cnt`, and `ans` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be `-1`.

4. **Output:**
   Output: **-1**
