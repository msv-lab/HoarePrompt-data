The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `i` is 2, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 2, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the minimum of Decimal('Infinity') and `cnt`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
