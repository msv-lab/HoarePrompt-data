Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of integers, the sum of the lengths of all inner lists in the input list does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False, `val` is the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val` before encountering a different element, or `n` if all elements are equal to `val`. `ans` is the minimum value between Decimal('Infinity') and the length of the longest prefix of `arr` where all elements are equal to `val` before encountering a different element. If all elements in `arr` are equal to `val`, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').**

In natural language, this means:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `arr` remains a list of integers, and the sum of the lengths of all inner lists does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- `i` is now `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
- `n` is the length of `arr` and must be greater than 0.
- `flag` remains True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, it remains False.
- `val` is still the first element of `arr`.
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of `arr` that are equal to `val` before a different element is found, or it is `n` if all elements are equal to `val`.
- `ans` is the minimum value between Decimal('Infinity') and the length of the longest prefix of `arr` where all elements are equal to `val` before a different element is found. If all elements in `arr` are equal to `val`, `ans` remains Decimal('Infinity').
