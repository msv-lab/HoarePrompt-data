Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least two elements, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` (which is `(a % x, a % y)` where `a` is the second element of `arr`) is in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with a value of 1. In both cases, `count` remains 0 if `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is updated to `count + freq[rx, ry]`, where `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`.***
