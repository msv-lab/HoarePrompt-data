You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and arr is a list of integers of length n, with each element a_i such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        freq = {}
        
        count = 0
        
        for a in arr:
            rx = (-a % x + x) % x
            ry = a % y
            if (rx, ry) in freq:
                count += freq[rx, ry]
            current_pair = a % x, a % y
            if current_pair in freq:
                freq[current_pair] += 1
            else:
                freq[current_pair] = 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least the number of tuples it started with, `results` is a list containing the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`, and `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in the corresponding `arr` for each tuple.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named `results` that contains the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` value represents the number of times a specific `(a % x, a % y)` pair occurred in the corresponding `arr` for each tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. It returns a list `results` where each element is the count of occurrences of a specific `(a % x, a % y)` pair in the corresponding `arr` for each tuple.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named `results` that contains the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` value represents the number of times a specific `(a % x, a % y)` pair occurred in the corresponding `arr` for each tuple.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
