Output State: **`data` is a list of lines from the input, `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing the tuples `(n, x, y, arr)` and `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is 5, `n` is the first integer from the line at index 5 of `data`, `x` is the second integer from the line at index 5 of `data`, `y` is the third integer from the line at index 5 of `data`, `arr` is a list of integers from the line at index 6 of `data`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))` updates the value of `arr` to a list of integers from the line at index 6 of `data` (since `idx` is 5 and `idx + 1` is 6). The other variables (`data`, `t`, `test_cases`, `idx`, `n`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
