Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that were already present in `freq` before the current iteration for all elements in `arr`.**
