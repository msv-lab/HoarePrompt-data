Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least two elements, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` remains 0 if `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is updated to `count + freq[rx, ry]`, `a` is the second element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, and `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`.**
