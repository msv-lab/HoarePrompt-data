You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least the number of tuples it started with, `results` is a list containing the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`, and `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in the corresponding `arr` for each tuple.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named `results` that contains the final `count` value for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` value represents the number of times a specific `(a % x, a % y)` pair occurred in the corresponding `arr` for each tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. It processes each tuple to count the number of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` in the list `arr` that have previously occurred. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the count of such occurrences for the corresponding tuple in `test_cases`. The input `test_cases` remains unchanged, and the final state of the program includes the `results` list containing these counts.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used. The function reads input from stdin and processes it to create a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing integers n, x, y, and a list of integers arr.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from standard input (stdin), processes it to create a list of test cases, and then passes this list to another function `func_1`. Each test case is a tuple containing four elements: three integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of integers `arr`. After receiving the results from `func_1`, it prints each result to the standard output (stdout). The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, the results from `func_1` have been printed, and the function has completed its execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then parses the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the input format and stores the test cases in a list.

2. **Processing Test Cases (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case in the `test_cases` list.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x` and adjusted to be non-negative.
     - It calculates `ry` as `a % y`, which is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
     - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

3. **Output (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The logic for determining if a pair is beautiful is correct. The conditions `a_i + a_j` being divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` being divisible by `y` are checked using the remainders `rx` and `ry`.
  - The use of a dictionary to count the frequency of pairs is efficient and correct.
  - The calculation of `rx` and `ry` ensures that the conditions are met for each pair.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The input parsing is correct and follows the specified format.
  - It correctly appends the test cases to the `test_cases` list and passes them to `func_1`.
  - It prints the results for each test case as required.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
