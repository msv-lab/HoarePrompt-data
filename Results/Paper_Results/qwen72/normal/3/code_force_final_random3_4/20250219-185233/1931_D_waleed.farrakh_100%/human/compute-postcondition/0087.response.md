Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least two elements, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` remains 0, `a` is the second element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, and `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rx` is calculated using the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`.
- The value of `ry` is calculated using the expression `a % y`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `freq`, and `count` remain unchanged.
- The values of `rx` and `ry` are now specific based on the values of `a`, `x`, and `y`.
