The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is a list of integers of length `n`, with each element `a_i` such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function processes each tuple in `test_cases` and returns a list named `results` that contains the final `count` value for each tuple. Each `count` value represents the number of times a specific `(a % x, a % y)` pair occurred in the corresponding `arr` for each tuple.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. It returns a list `results` where each element is the count of occurrences of a specific `(a % x, a % y)` pair in the corresponding `arr` for each tuple.**
