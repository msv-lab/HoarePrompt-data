The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.**
