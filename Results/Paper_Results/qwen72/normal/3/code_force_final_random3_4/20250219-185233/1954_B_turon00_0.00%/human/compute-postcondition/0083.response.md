Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`.
- Given that `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n`, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum of `n` and 2.
- Since `n` is an input integer greater than 2, the value of `ans` will be 2.
- The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
