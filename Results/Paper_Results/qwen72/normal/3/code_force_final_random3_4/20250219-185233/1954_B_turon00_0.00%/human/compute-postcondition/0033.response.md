Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reassigns the variable `a` to a new list of integers input by the user.
- The initial state mentions that `a` is already a list of integers, but this code overrides the previous value of `a` with a new list of integers.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `tmp`, `aa`, `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `a` and retains the initial conditions for the other variables.
