Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Global Variables**: The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are defined as global variables inside the `func_1` function, but they are modified within the `make_array` function. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when handling multiple test cases.

2. **Incorrect Clique Calculation**: The calculation of the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)` is incorrect. The number of cliques should be based on the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \), and the current logic does not correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

3. **Incorrect Partitioning Logic**: The logic in `make_array` for assigning elements to the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays is flawed. The program attempts to split the range of vertices into two parts and assign them in a specific order, but this does not guarantee that the resulting graph will be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

4. **Output for Each Test Case**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It should print the output for each test case separately, but the current structure does not ensure this.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(n):
        cliquess[i] = (i // k) + 1

    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, k)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Clique Calculation**: The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is correct for the given problem.
2. **Assignment of Values**: The `arr` array is initialized with values from 1 to n, ensuring all values are distinct and within the range.
3. **Partitioning Logic**: The `cliquess` array is assigned values based on the index divided by `k`, which ensures that vertices are partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately, printing the output for each one.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
