To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions provided:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop head is `for i in range(not_mid):`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `not_mid`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2.
   - `clique` is a positive integer.
   - `small_element` is `left + 1`.
   - `big_element` is `right + 1`.
   - `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
   - `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right`.
   - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `not_mid`.

4. **Verification of `not_mid`**:
   - `not_mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`.
   - Given that `right - left` is at least 2, let's verify the value of `not_mid`:
     - If `right - left` is 2, then `not_mid` is `(2 + 1) - (2 // 2) = 3 - 1 = 2`.
     - If `right - left` is 3, then `not_mid` is `(3 + 1) - (3 // 2) = 4 - 1 = 3`.
     - If `right - left` is 4, then `not_mid` is `(4 + 1) - (4 // 2) = 5 - 2 = 3`.
     - If `right - left` is 5, then `not_mid` is `(5 + 1) - (5 // 2) = 6 - 2 = 4`.
   - Therefore, `not_mid` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - The condition `i < not_mid` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.**
