Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls `func_1(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It then calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the appropriate range and the clique number.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the elements of `cliquess`.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function is responsible for filling the `arr` and `cliquess` lists with values for a specific clique.
   - It calculates the midpoint of the range `[left, right]` and fills the first half of the range in `arr` with increasing values starting from `left + 1`.
   - It fills the second half of the range in `arr` with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`.
   - It sets the corresponding elements in `cliquess` to the given `clique` number.

4. **Graph Construction and Clique Partitioning**:
   - The goal is to assign integers to vertices such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is a reasonable approach because each clique can cover at most `k` vertices.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the vertices within each clique are assigned values such that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied. This is achieved by assigning values in a way that the difference in indices and values is minimized within each clique.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The output format matches the problem description: the first line contains the assigned values, the second line contains the number of cliques, and the third line contains the clique assignments for each vertex.
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the program, as the output matches the expected format and values.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by ensuring that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques and that the vertices are assigned values that satisfy the given condition.

Correctness: **True**
