To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `mid`.

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(mid):` will execute if `mid` is greater than 0. If `mid` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

2. **Check the initial state of `mid`**:
   - `mid` is defined as `(right - left) // 2`.
   - For the loop to execute, `mid` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the conditions for `mid` to be greater than 0**:
   - `(right - left) // 2 > 0`
   - This implies that `right - left` must be greater than 1 (since integer division by 2 of a number less than or equal to 1 will result in 0).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure `mid` is greater than 0, `right - left` must be at least 2.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `right - left` is at least 2.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)`, `i` is 0**
