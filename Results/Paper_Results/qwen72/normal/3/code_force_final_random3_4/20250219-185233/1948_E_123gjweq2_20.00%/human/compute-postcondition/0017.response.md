The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `not_mid`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must still be less than `not_mid`.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 2, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - ((right - left) // 2)` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `right + 1 - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`**
