Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]` minus 1, `n` must be at least 0, `j` is 1, and `cntl[j]` is less than 2. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values of `a`, `c`, `n`, and `j`.***
