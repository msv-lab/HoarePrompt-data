You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of test cases, t, should satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and for each test case, the output is the first index `j` (starting from 1) where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the output is 0 for that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function outputs the first index `j` (starting from 1) where the count of `j` in the list is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists. If the count of 0 in the list is 0, the function outputs 0 for that test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` with zeros. This list will be used to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program iterates over the elements of `a` and increments the corresponding index in `cntl` to count how many times each integer appears in `a`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - The program checks if `cntl[0]` is zero. If it is, it prints `0` because the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` is `0`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not zero, the program initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of `2` and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can pick at most one `0` to maximize the score, and Bob can pick at most one `0` to minimize the score.
   - The program then iterates over the integers from `1` to `n` to determine the MEX.
   - For each integer `j`, if `cntl[j]` is less than `2`, it means that at most one `j` can be in `c` (either picked by Alice or Bob).
   - The variable `c` is decremented by `1` for each such integer `j` that appears less than twice.
   - If `c` becomes zero or `j` reaches `n`, the program prints `j` as the MEX and breaks out of the loop.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of MEX Calculation:**
  - The program correctly identifies that if `0` is not in `a`, the MEX is `0`.
  - For other integers, the program ensures that both players play optimally by considering the minimum number of times an integer can appear in `c` (at most once for each integer that appears less than twice in `a`).

- **Optimal Play:**
  - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that can help maximize the MEX.
  - Bob will always try to pick the smallest integer that can help minimize the MEX.
  - The program correctly handles the scenario where both players play optimally by ensuring that the MEX is calculated based on the minimum number of times each integer can appear in `c`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
