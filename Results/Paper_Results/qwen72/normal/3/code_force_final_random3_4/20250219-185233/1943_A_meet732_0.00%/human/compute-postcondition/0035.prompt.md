Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is updated to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`, and if `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the original values of `c` and `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is updated to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues as it was before the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
