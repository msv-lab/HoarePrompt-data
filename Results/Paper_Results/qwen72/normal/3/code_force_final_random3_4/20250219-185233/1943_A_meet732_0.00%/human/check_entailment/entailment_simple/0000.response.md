Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play their game optimally. The logic behind the solution is to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using the `cntl` list. The key insight is that since Alice wants to maximize the MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, Alice will always try to include numbers that are necessary to increase the MEX, while Bob will try to remove numbers that Alice needs.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each number in `a`.
   - It correctly increments the count for each number in `a`.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means that 0 is not in the array `a`, and thus the MEX of `c` will be 0. This is handled correctly.
   - If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the program initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is because Alice can include at most 2 occurrences of 0 in `c` (since Bob will try to remove one if possible).
   - The program then iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if the count of each number is less than 2. If it is, it decreases `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0 or if the current number `j` is `n`, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - The logic of checking if `cntl[j]` is less than 2 is correct because Alice and Bob will play optimally. Alice will include numbers that are necessary to increase the MEX, and Bob will remove numbers that Alice needs. If a number `j` appears fewer than 2 times, it means that Bob can remove it, and Alice cannot ensure its inclusion in `c` to increase the MEX.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `cntl[0]` is 0 correctly by printing 0.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where all numbers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `a` by printing `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
