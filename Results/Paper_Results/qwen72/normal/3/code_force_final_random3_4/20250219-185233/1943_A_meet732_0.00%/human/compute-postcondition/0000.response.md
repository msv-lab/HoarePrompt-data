The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a counter for the number of iterations. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases, `t`.

For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means that the number of test cases, `t`, must be at least 1. Since the variable `_` is not initialized before the loop, it will start from 0 (as is typical in Python's `range` function).

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
