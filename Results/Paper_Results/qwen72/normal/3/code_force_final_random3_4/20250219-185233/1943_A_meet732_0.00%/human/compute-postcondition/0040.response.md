Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]` reinitializes the list `cntl` to a new list of length `n + 1`, where each element is `0`. The initial state of `a` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `cntl` list and retains the initial state of `a` and `n`.
