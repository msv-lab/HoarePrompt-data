Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all iterations, the list `a` remains unchanged. The list `cntl` has been updated such that for each integer `i` in `a`, the element at index `i` in `cntl` is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`. All other elements in `cntl` remain 0.
