The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function outputs the first index `j` (starting from 1) where the count of `j` in the list is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists. If the count of 0 in the list is 0, the function outputs 0 for that test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.
