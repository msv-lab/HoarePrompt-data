Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appeared in the list `a`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. Additionally, the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**
