Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appeared in the list `a`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `cntl`, `n`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
