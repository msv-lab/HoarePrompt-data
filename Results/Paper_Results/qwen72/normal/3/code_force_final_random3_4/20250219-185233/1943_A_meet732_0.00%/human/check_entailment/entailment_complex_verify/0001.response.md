### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` with zeros. This list will be used to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program iterates over the elements of `a` and increments the corresponding index in `cntl` to count how many times each integer appears in `a`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - The program checks if `cntl[0]` is zero. If it is, it prints `0` because the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` is `0`.
   - This check is correct because if `0` is not in `a`, it cannot be in `c`, and thus the MEX is `0`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not zero, the program initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of `2` and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can pick at most one `0` to maximize the score, and Bob can pick at most one `0` to minimize the score.
   - The program then iterates over the integers from `1` to `n` to determine the MEX.
   - For each integer `j`, if `cntl[j]` is less than `2`, it means that at most one `j` can be in `c` (either picked by Alice or Bob).
   - The variable `c` is decremented by `1` for each such integer `j` that appears less than twice.
   - If `c` becomes zero or `j` reaches `n`, the program prints `j` as the MEX and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Correctness of MEX Calculation:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `0` is not in `a`, the MEX is `0`.
   - For other integers, the program ensures that both players play optimally by considering the minimum number of times an integer can appear in `c` (at most once for each integer that appears less than twice in `a`).

6. **Optimal Play:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that can help maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will always try to pick the smallest integer that can help minimize the MEX.
   - The program correctly handles the scenario where both players play optimally by ensuring that the MEX is calculated based on the minimum number of times each integer can appear in `c`.

### Analysis of Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The total number of test cases, `t`, should satisfy `1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4`, and the sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed `2 · 10^5`.
  - This is correctly handled by the program.

- **State After Reading Input:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

- **State After Counting Occurrences:**
  - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using the list `cntl`.

- **State After Initial Check for MEX 0:**
  - The program correctly checks if `0` is not in `a` and prints `0` if so.

- **State After Iterating Over Integers:**
  - The program iterates over the integers from `1` to `n` and decrements `c` for each integer that appears less than twice.
  - The program prints the first integer `j` where `c` becomes zero or `j` reaches `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
