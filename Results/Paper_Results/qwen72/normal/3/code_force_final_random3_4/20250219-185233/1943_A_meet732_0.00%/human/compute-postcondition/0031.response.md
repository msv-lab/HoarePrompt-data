Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `c` is decreased by 1 (though `c` is not used in the print statement).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly set to 3 in the initial state.
   - The `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **3**
