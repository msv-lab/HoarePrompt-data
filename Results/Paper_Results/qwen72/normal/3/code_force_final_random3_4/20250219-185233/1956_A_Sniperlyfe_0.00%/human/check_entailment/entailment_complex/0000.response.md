**Reasoning:**

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of players initially) and `p` (a list of positions of players to be kicked out).
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `p`.
   - In each iteration of the loop, it decreases `n` by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
   - The loop terminates when `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
   - The function returns the final value of `n`, which is the number of players remaining after all rounds.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, followed by the list `p` and the list `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
   - It prints the contents of `res` as a space-separated string after processing all `n` values in `qs`.

3. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input handling in `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases, the values of `k` and `q`, the list `p`, and the list `qs`.
   - The output is correctly formatted as a space-separated string of results for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm in `func_1` correctly simulates the rounds of the game by decrementing `n` by the number of players to be kicked out in each round.
   - The loop condition ensures that the game stops when no more players can be kicked out, which is when `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
   - The results are correctly accumulated and printed for each test case.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_2` prints the results inside the loop for each `n` in `qs`. This means that the results are printed prematurely, and the final output for each test case is not complete.
   - The correct approach would be to print the results after all `n` values in `qs` have been processed.

**Conclusion:**
The program is almost correct, but the printing of results in `func_2` should be moved outside the loop to ensure that the final output for each test case is complete. Therefore, the program is incorrect due to this issue.

**Correctness: **False**
