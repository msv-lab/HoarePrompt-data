Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 integers.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it twice.
   - `n` is the third integer in `qs`.

2. **Understanding the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))`.
   - This statement will convert each element in the list `res` to a string, join them with a space, and then print the resulting string.

3. **Determining the values:**
   - `n` is the third integer in `qs`.
   - `res` is a list that contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it twice.
   - Since `func_1(n, p)` is called twice and its result is appended to `res` twice, `res` will contain two identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the elements of `res` separated by a space.
   - Since `res` contains two identical elements, the output will be the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice, separated by a space.

Given the initial state and the structure of the `print` statement, the output will be:

Output: **result_of_func_1(n, p) result_of_func_1(n, p) (where n is the third integer in the list qs and result_of_func_1(n, p) is the result of the function func_1 called with n and p)**

This output format clearly indicates that the `print` statement will print the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, separated by a space, where `n` is the third integer in the list `qs` and `p` is the list of integers provided by the user.
