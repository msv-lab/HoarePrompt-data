Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the first element in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The value of `n` is the first element in the list `qs`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`) remain unchanged. The list `res` is no longer empty and contains the result of the function call.
