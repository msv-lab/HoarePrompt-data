### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a game where players are lined up and certain players are kicked out based on a sequence `a` of integers. The game continues until no more players can be kicked out, and the remaining players are declared winners.
   - We need to determine the number of winners for multiple initial player counts `n_i`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` correctly simulates the game rounds.
   - It uses a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - Inside the loop, it subtracts the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n`.
   - This effectively simulates the rounds of the game where players are kicked out.
   - Once the loop exits, the remaining value of `n` is the number of players who are not kicked out and are declared as winners.
   - The function returns this remaining value.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the length of the sequence `a` and the number of queries.
   - It then reads the sequence `a` and the list of queries `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each query `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
   - The print statement is inside the loop, which means it will print the results for each query individually, not as a single line for the entire test case.

4. **Issues:**
   - The print statement inside the loop in `func_2` is incorrect. It should be outside the loop to print the results for all queries in a single line for each test case.
   - This is a critical issue because the output format is specified to be a single line of results for each test case.

### Corrected Function 2:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Correctness:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct and simulates the game as described.
- The logic in `func_2` is almost correct, but the print statement needs to be moved outside the loop to ensure the results are printed correctly.

**Final: **False**

### Explanation:
- The program is incorrect because the print statement inside the loop in `func_2` causes the results to be printed prematurely, one by one, instead of all at once for each test case. This will lead to incorrect output formatting, which is a critical issue given the problem's requirements.
