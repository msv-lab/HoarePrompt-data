The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a list of positive integers `p` (where each integer is unique and sorted in increasing order). It decreases `n` by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` in each iteration until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`. The function returns the final value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer and is guaranteed to be less than the smallest positive integer in the list `p`. The list `p` remains unchanged.
