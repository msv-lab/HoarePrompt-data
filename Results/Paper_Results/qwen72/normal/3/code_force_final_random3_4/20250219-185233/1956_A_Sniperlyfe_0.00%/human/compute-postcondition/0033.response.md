Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.**

The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `p` to be a list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `qs`, and `res`) remain unchanged. The new value of `p` is a list of integers derived from the user input.
