The only objects in the loop head are `n` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again with `n` being the next element in `qs`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the first element in `qs`, and `qs` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least 2 elements, and `n` will be the second element in `qs`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the second element in `qs`.**
