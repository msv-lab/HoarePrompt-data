The only objects in the loop head are `n` and `qs`. The loop iterates over the elements of `qs`, assigning each element to `n` in sequence. At the end of the last iteration, `n` was the second element in `qs`, and `qs` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to have executed up to this point.

For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least 3 elements, and `n` will be the third element in `qs`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, `n` is the third element in `qs`.**
