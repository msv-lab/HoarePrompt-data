Reasoning:  
The provided problem description and the execution summary describe a function `func` that reads multiple test cases from the user, processes each test case, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. The function is designed to handle the following cases:
1. If `n` is 2, the function prints 'YES' if `s` is '00', otherwise 'NO'.
2. If `n` is not 2, the function prints 'NO' if the number of '1' characters in `s` is odd or if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1' characters; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The function `func` is implemented correctly according to these rules:
- It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `s`.
- It correctly handles the case when `n` is 2.
- It correctly handles the case when `n` is not 2 by checking the count of '1' characters and the occurrence of '11'.
- The function prints the correct output for each test case and concludes with no further actions or side effects.

The provided execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the function matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
