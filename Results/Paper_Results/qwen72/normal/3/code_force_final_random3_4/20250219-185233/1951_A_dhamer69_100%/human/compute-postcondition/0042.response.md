Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 2` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string. If `s` == '00', the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.*** 

However, since the if and else parts have the same postconditions, the overall postcondition can be simplified to:
Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 2` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string.***
