### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of two distinct parts: the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function and the `func` function. However, the `func` function is not related to the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function and does not impact its correctness. Therefore, we will focus on the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

#### Problem Description:
The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is supposed to:
1. Get the current working directory.
2. Find all subfolders in the current directory.
3. Check if the folder name is a digit and falls within the specified range (`start` to `end`).
4. If the folder name is within the range, find all `.html` files in that folder.
5. For each `.html` file, generate two new files: one with the suffix `-ac.py` and another with the suffix `-wa.py`.
6. Print the number of HTML files in each folder and the paths of the generated files.

#### Execution States:
- The function is called with `start_range` and `end_range` as integers such that `0 <= start_range <= end_range`.
- The function should correctly identify subfolders whose names are digits and fall within the specified range.
- For each valid subfolder, it should list all `.html` files and generate the corresponding `-ac.py` and `-wa.py` files.
- The function should print the appropriate messages for each valid subfolder.

#### Analysis:
1. **Getting the Current Directory and Subfolders:**
   - `os.getcwd()` correctly gets the current working directory.
   - `os.scandir(current_dir)` is used to list all entries in the current directory.
   - The list comprehension `[f.path for f in os.scandir(current_dir) if f.is_dir()]` correctly filters out only the subfolders.

2. **Checking Folder Names:**
   - `folder_name.isdigit()` checks if the folder name is a digit.
   - `start <= int(folder_name) <= end` checks if the folder name falls within the specified range.

3. **Finding HTML Files:**
   - `os.listdir(folder)` lists all files in the subfolder.
   - The list comprehension `[f for f in os.listdir(folder) if f.endswith('.html')]` correctly filters out only the `.html` files.

4. **Generating New Files:**
   - `os.path.splitext(html_file)[0]` correctly gets the base name of the `.html` file.
   - `os.path.join(folder, f"{base_name}-ac.py")` and `os.path.join(folder, f"{base_name}-wa.py")` correctly construct the paths for the new files.
   - `open(ac_file, 'w').close()` and `open(wa_file, 'w').close()` correctly create the new files.

5. **Printing Messages:**
   - The function prints the number of HTML files in each valid subfolder.
   - The function prints the paths of the generated files.

#### Conclusion:
The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function appears to correctly implement the problem description. It correctly identifies subfolders within the specified range, finds `.html` files, generates the required files, and prints the appropriate messages.

### Correctness:
**True**
