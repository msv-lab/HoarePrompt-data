Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2, `s` is an input string, and `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, no changes are made. If `count_1` is even, and if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
