Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, and `count_1` is even. Additionally, the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', and `count_1` is 2.**
