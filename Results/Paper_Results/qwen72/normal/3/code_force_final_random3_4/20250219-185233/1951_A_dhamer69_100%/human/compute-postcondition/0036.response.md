Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a new input string. If `n` == 2, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `n` != 2 and `s` == '00', the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `n` != 2 and `count_1` (the number of '1' characters in `s`) is odd, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `n` != 2 and `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1' characters, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `t` is `t - 2`.
- The values of `start`, `end`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `n` and `s` are still valid and unchanged.
