Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `k` is the last even number less than `n`.
   - `no_path` is False.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `no_path` is False, then `k` is updated to the last odd number less than `n`.
   - If any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` is set to False.
   - Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.
   - If `no_path` was initially True, it remains True.
   - Additionally, `no_path` is False.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `no_path` is initially False, the condition `if no_path is False` is true.
   - Therefore, `k` is updated to the last odd number less than `n`.
   - The next condition checks if any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>'. However, since `no_path` is already False, this condition does not change the value of `no_path`.
   - The final statement `no_path` is False is redundant because `no_path` is already False.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `no_path` remains False throughout the execution of the conditions.
   - The `print('NO')` statement will be executed.

Output: **NO**
