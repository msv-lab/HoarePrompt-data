Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `k` is 4, `no_path` is False.**

The code snippet `no_path = False` explicitly sets the variable `no_path` to `False`. The initial state specified that `no_path` would be `False` if the first character of `b` is not '>', and `True` otherwise. Since the code snippet sets `no_path` to `False` regardless of the value of `b`, the output state reflects this change. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
