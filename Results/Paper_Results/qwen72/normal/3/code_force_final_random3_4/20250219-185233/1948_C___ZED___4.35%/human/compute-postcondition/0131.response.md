The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and a list of tuples. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is a list of integers where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and n is even. The third parameter is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two strings of length n, consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns the number of columns where the arrows in both rows point towards each other for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` where each integer is the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n, consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid. It returns a list of integers, each representing the number of columns where the arrows in both rows point towards each other for each test case.**
