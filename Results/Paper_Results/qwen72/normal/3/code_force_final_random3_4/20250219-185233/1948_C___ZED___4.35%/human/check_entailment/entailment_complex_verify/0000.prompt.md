You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n, consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. Additionally, n is even, no arrows point outside the grid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())

        b = input()

                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `b[-2]` is not '>', `no_path` remains either True or False based on the initial conditions. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is 1, `no_path` remains either True or False based on the initial conditions. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `no_path` was initially True, it remains True. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `no_path` was initially False, `k` is updated to the last odd number less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if the second-to-last character in `b` is '>'. If it is not, the function prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the first row to the second row by examining the characters at even and odd indices in `a` and `b`. If all characters at even indices in `b` are '>' and all characters at odd indices in `a` are '>', the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when the robot can reach the cell (2, n) but the logic in the code incorrectly determines that it cannot. Specifically, the logic checks if `b[-2]` is not '>', which is a flawed check. The robot can still reach (2, n) even if `b[-2]` is not '>', as long as there is a valid path from (1, 1) to (2, n) considering the movement rules.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
><><
>><<
```
The correct output should be `YES` because the robot can follow the path: (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (2, 4). However, the program will output `NO` because `b[-2]` is not '>'. This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected.
