Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when the robot can reach the cell (2, n) but the logic in the code incorrectly determines that it cannot. Specifically, the logic checks if `b[-2]` is not '>', which is a flawed check. The robot can still reach (2, n) even if `b[-2]` is not '>', as long as there is a valid path from (1, 1) to (2, n) considering the movement rules.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
><><
>><<
```
The correct output should be `YES` because the robot can follow the path: (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (2, 4). However, the program will output `NO` because `b[-2]` is not '>'. This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected.
