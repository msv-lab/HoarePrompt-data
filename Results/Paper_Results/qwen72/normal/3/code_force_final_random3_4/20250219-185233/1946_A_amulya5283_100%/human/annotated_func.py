#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases t is given such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            res = 0
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                    res += 1
            print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input. If `n` == 1, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `a`. Otherwise, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to the element at index `mdx`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the array `a` and then counts the number of elements from the middle index to the end of the array that are equal to the element at the middle index. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. The function continues processing until all test cases are handled, and at the end, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, and `a` is the last sorted list of integers provided in the input. The function prints the result for each test case.
