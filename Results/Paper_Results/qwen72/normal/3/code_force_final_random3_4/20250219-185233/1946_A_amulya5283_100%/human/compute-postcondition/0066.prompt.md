Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and the function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        res = 0
        mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
        for i in range(mdx, n):
            if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                res += 1
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input. If `n` is equal to 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `i` is set to `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an input integer - 2 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input. If `n` == 1, there are no changes to `t`, `n`, or `a`. Otherwise, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input. If `n` == 1, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `a`. Otherwise, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to the element at index `mdx`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
