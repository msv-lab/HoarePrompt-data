Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the array `a` and then counts the number of elements from the middle index to the end of the array that are equal to the element at the middle index. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. The function continues processing until all test cases are handled, and at the end, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, and `a` is the last sorted list of integers provided in the input. The function prints the result for each test case. **
