### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is necessary to correctly identify the median.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula correctly identifies the median index for both even and odd lengths of the array.
   - For an odd-length array, `mdx` will be the middle index.
   - For an even-length array, `mdx` will be the first of the two middle indices.

4. **Operation Counting**:
   - The function initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of operations required to increase the median.
   - It then iterates from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array, counting the number of elements that are equal to the element at the median index `a[mdx]`.

5. **Output**:
   - If `n` is 1, the function prints 1, which is correct because the median of a single-element array can always be increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `res`, which is the count of elements from the median index to the end of the array that are equal to the median element.

### Issues:
- The logic for counting the number of operations to increase the median is incorrect. The function should count the number of operations required to make the median element greater than its current value, not just count the number of elements equal to the median.
- For an even-length array, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but the function only considers the first middle element.
- The function does not correctly handle the case where the median needs to be increased by more than one operation.

### Correct Approach:
- For an odd-length array, the median is the middle element. To increase the median, we need to increase the middle element to the next higher value that is not already in the array.
- For an even-length array, the median is the average of the two middle elements. To increase the median, we need to increase the second middle element to the next higher value that is not already in the array.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
