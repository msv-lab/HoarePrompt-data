Output State: **`t` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input. If `n` == 1, there are no changes to `t`, `n`, or `a`. Otherwise, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains 3 as it is not affected by the code.
- `n` is assigned the value of the input integer.
- `a` remains a sorted list of integers as provided in the input.
- If `n` is 1, no further changes occur to `t`, `n`, or `a`.
- If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is the count of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
