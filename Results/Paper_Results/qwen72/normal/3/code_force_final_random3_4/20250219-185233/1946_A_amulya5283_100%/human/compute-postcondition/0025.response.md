Output State: **`t` is an input integer - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input. If `n` is equal to 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `i` is set to `n`.**
