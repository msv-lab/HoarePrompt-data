Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `arr` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, where '1' indicates a cell with a chip and '0' indicates a free cell. The function then finds the first and last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, extracts the substring between these positions, and prints the count of '0's in this substring. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and the count of '0's between the first and last '1' in each test case has been printed. **
