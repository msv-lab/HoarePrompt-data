Output State: **`minn` is 1, 2, or 3, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `minn` (previously 0, 1, or 2), and possibly `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `maxx` is 0, the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, or the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is incremented by 1, so if it was 0, it becomes 1; if it was 1, it becomes 2; if it was 2, it becomes 3.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, `mex`, `maxx`, and `i` remain unchanged.
