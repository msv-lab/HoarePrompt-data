Postcondition: ***`minn` is 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and `minn` (which is now 1 or 2), `maxx` is 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 1. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1.***
