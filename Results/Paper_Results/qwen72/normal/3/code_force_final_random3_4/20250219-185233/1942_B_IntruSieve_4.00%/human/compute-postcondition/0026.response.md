Postcondition: ***`minn` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and possibly `minn` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `maxx` is 0, the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, or the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, and `i` is 1. If `arr[i] > 0`, `minn` is updated to 1 or 2, and if `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1. If `arr[i] <= 0`, `mex` is updated to include `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`.***
