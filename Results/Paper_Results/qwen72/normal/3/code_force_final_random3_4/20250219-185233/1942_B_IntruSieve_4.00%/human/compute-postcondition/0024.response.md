Output State: **`minn` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and now also contains `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `maxx` is `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[1] - minn)`.
- The values of `minn`, `n`, `arr`, `mex`, and `i` remain unchanged.
