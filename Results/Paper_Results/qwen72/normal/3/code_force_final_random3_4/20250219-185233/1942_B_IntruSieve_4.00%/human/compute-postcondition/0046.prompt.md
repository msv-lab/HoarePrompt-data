You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`, and an array `a` of length `n` with elements in the range (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. It is guaranteed that at least one valid permutation `p` exists for the given `a`.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: `minn` is the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` + 1 (or 0 if no positive integers are in `arr`), `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either the value of `minn` before the iteration or the absolute difference between the corresponding element in `arr` and `minn`, `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`, and `i` is `n - 1`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: `minn` is the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` + 1 (or 0 if no positive integers are in `arr`), `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers that has been fully iterated, `i` is `n - 1`, and `itm` is the last element in `mex`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. It returns a valid permutation `p` for the given array `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
