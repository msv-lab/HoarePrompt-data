Output State: **`minn` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing the value 0, `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`) is greater than 0. `minn` is now equal to `maxx + 1`, which means `minn` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `minn = maxx + 1` updates the value of `minn` to be `maxx + 1`.
- Since `maxx` is 0, `minn` becomes 0 + 1, which is 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
