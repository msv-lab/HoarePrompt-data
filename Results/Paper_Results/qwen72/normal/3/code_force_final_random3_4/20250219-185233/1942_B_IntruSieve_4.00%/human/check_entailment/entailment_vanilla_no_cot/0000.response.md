Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The logic in the program does not accurately reflect the relationship between `a` and `p` as described in the problem statement.

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation and Usage**:
   - The program attempts to build the `mex` array, but it does not correctly calculate the MEX of the prefix of `p` for each step.
   - The variable `minn` is used to track the next smallest unused number, but it is not always correctly updated to reflect the MEX of the current prefix of `p`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Values**:
   - When `arr[i]` is negative, the program incorrectly calculates the value to append to `mex` using `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. This does not align with the problem's requirement that `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.

3. **Incorrect Permutation Construction**:
   - The program does not ensure that the constructed permutation `p` is a valid permutation of integers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The program does not correctly handle the relationship between `a` and `p` for all cases, especially when `a_i` is negative.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to construct the permutation `p` such that the MEX of the prefix of `p` minus `p_i` equals `a_i`. Here is a correct approach:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use a set to keep track of the numbers that have been used in the permutation.
   - Use a variable to keep track of the current MEX.

2. **Construct the Permutation**:
   - For each element in `a`, determine the value of `p_i` that satisfies the equation `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.
   - Update the set of used numbers and the MEX accordingly.

3. **Output the Permutation**:
   - Print the constructed permutation for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_mex(used, current_mex):
    while current_mex in used:
        current_mex += 1
    return current_mex

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    used = set()
    mex = 0
    p = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            p_i = mex - arr[i]
            p.append(p_i)
            used.add(p_i)
            mex = find_mex(used, mex)
        else:
            p_i = mex - arr[i]
            p.append(p_i)
            used.add(p_i)
            mex = find_mex(used, mex)
    
    for itm in p:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected program ensures that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly and satisfies the given conditions for the array `a`.
