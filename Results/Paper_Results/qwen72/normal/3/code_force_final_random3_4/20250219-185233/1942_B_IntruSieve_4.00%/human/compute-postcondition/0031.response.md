Postcondition: **If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, `minn` remains 1, 2, or 3. In both cases, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `minn` (previously 0, 1, or 2), and possibly `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, `maxx` is 0, the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, or the maximum of `abs(arr[1] - minn)` and the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, and `i` is 2.**
