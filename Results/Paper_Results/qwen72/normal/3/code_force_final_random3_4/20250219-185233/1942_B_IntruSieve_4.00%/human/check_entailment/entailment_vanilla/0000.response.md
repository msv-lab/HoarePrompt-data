### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The task is to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` that satisfies this condition.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes two variables `minn` and `maxx` to 0. `minn` is used to track the smallest unused integer, and `maxx` is used to track the largest integer in the permutation so far.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates through each element `a_i` in the array `a`.
   - If `a_i` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn` by 1. This is because if `a_i` is positive, it means the MEX of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` is greater than `p_i`, and the smallest unused integer `minn` is a good candidate for `p_i`.
   - If `a_i` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list. This is because if `a_i` is non-positive, it means the MEX of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` is less than or equal to `p_i`, and the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is a candidate for `p_i`.
   - After appending the value, it checks if the new value is greater than `maxx` and updates `maxx` accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `mex` for each test case, the program prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation based on the given conditions.
   - It ensures that the smallest unused integer is used when `a_i` is positive, and it correctly calculates the value to append when `a_i` is non-positive.
   - The program also updates the `maxx` variable to ensure that the largest integer in the permutation is tracked correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions for the array `a`. The logic and steps used in the program align with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
