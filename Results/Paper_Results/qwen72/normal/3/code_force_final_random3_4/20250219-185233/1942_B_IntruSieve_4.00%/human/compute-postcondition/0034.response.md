Postcondition: ***`minn` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and possibly `minn` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`, and `i` is 2. If `abs(arr[2] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[2] - minn)` and `mex` includes the value `abs(arr[2] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged and `mex` includes the value `abs(arr[2] - minn)`.***
