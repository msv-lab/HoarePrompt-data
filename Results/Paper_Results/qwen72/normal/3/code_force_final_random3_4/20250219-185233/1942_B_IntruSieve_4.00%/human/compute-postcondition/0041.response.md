The only objects in the loop head are `itm` and `mex`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `mex`. If `mex` has at least three elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `itm` was the second element in `mex`, and `mex` must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `mex` must have at least three elements, and `itm` will be the third element in `mex`.

State: **`minn` is the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` + 1 (or 0 if no positive integers are in `arr`), `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `itm` is the third element in `mex`**
