Postcondition: **`minn` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, the absolute value of the first element of `arr` minus `minn` is greater than `maxx`.**
