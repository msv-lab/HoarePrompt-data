Postcondition: ***`minn` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `maxx` is the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 0, and the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0. If the absolute value of the first element of `arr` minus `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to the absolute value of the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains 0.***
