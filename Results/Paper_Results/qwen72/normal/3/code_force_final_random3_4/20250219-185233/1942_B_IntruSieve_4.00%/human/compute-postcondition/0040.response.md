Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `minn` is the highest positive integer value encountered in `arr` + 1 (or 0 if no positive integers are in `arr`).
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `arr` is the list of integers input by the user.
   - `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `itm` is the second element in `mex`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(itm, end=' ')`.

3. **Determine the Value of `itm`:**
   - According to the initial state, `itm` is the second element in the list `mex`.
   - Since `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `itm` is guaranteed to be an integer.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `itm` followed by a space (because `end=' '` is specified).

Therefore, the output will be the second element of the list `mex` followed by a space.

Output: **[second element of mex] (where the second element of mex is the integer value at index 1 of the list mex)**
