### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \) such that for each \( i \), \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The \(\texttt{MEX}\) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

Let's break down the logic of the given program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program initializes two variables: `minn` and `maxx`, both set to 0.
   - It iterates through each element in \( a \):
     - If \( a_i \) is positive, it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \) is non-positive, it appends \( \text{abs}(a_i - \text{minn}) \) to the `mex` list and updates `maxx` if necessary.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Positive \( a_i \):**
  - When \( a_i \) is positive, it means \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) \) is greater than \( p_i \). The smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used yet is `minn`, so \( p_i \) is set to `minn`, and `minn` is incremented.
  - This ensures that the smallest unused integer is always added to the permutation.

- **Non-positive \( a_i \):**
  - When \( a_i \) is non-positive, it means \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) \) is less than or equal to \( p_i \). The value \( \text{abs}(a_i - \text{minn}) \) is used to determine \( p_i \).
  - The logic here is to find a value that fits the condition \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i = a_i \). The value \( \text{abs}(a_i - \text{minn}) \) is chosen to ensure that the \(\texttt{MEX}\) condition is met.

### Issues and Correctness:

- **Handling of Non-positive \( a_i \):**
  - The program uses \( \text{abs}(a_i - \text{minn}) \) to handle non-positive \( a_i \). This is not correct because it does not directly ensure that the \(\texttt{MEX}\) condition is met.
  - For example, if \( a_i = -2 \) and `minn = 0`, the program appends \( \text{abs}(-2 - 0) = 2 \) to `mex`. This does not necessarily mean that 2 is the correct value for \( p_i \) to satisfy the \(\texttt{MEX}\) condition.

- **Update of `maxx`:**
  - The program updates `maxx` if \( \text{abs}(a_i - \text{minn}) \) is greater than `maxx`. This is not necessary for the \(\texttt{MEX}\) calculation and can lead to incorrect values being added to the permutation.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly construct the permutation \( p \), we need to ensure that the \(\texttt{MEX}\) condition is met for each \( i \). This can be done by maintaining a set of used integers and calculating the \(\texttt{MEX}\) dynamically.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation \( p \) based on the \(\texttt{MEX}\) condition, especially for non-positive \( a_i \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
