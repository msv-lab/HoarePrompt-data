Output State: **`minn` is `maxx` + 1, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either the value 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and `minn` (which is now `maxx` + 1), `maxx` is 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is updated to `maxx` + 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `arr` remains a list of integers input by the user.
- `mex` still contains either 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr` and `minn` (which is now `maxx` + 1).
- `maxx` remains 0 or the absolute value of the first element of `arr`.
- `i` remains 1.
