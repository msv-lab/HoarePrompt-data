### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

The provided program attempts to construct the permutation `p` by maintaining two variables: `minn` and `maxx`. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, which represents the current smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the permutation.
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0, which represents the current maximum value in the permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates over each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`.
   - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0:
     - It appends `minn` to the `mex` list.
     - Increments `minn` by 1.
     - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it updates `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0:
     - It appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list.
     - If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx` to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of the `mex` list, which is supposed to be the permutation `p`.

### Analysis:

- **Positive `arr[i]` Case:**
  - When `arr[i]` is positive, the program correctly appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This ensures that the smallest unused non-negative integer is added to the permutation.
  - The condition `if minn == maxx` is used to handle the case where the smallest unused integer has been used up, and it updates `minn` to the next available integer.

- **Negative `arr[i]` Case:**
  - When `arr[i]` is negative, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is intended to handle the case where the MEX value is greater than the current permutation value.
  - The condition `if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx` updates `maxx` to the new maximum value in the permutation.

### Issues:

- **Handling of `minn` and `maxx`:**
  - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is not entirely correct. Specifically, the condition `if minn == maxx` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect values being appended to `mex`.
  - The program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation for the entire prefix of the permutation. The MEX should be calculated based on the current elements in `mex`, not just the current value of `minn`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the elements of `mex` as the permutation `p`, but `mex` is not guaranteed to be a valid permutation based on the MEX definition.

### Correctness:

Given the issues in the logic for updating `minn` and `maxx`, and the incorrect handling of the MEX calculation, the program does not always produce a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
