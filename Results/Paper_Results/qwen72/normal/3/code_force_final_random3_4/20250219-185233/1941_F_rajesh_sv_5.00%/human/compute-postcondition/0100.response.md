Output State: **`l` is equal to `mid + 1`, `h` is equal to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation:
- `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- `h` remains equal to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
- The condition that `l` must be less than `h` is still valid.
- `mid` remains equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- `mid_sum` remains equal to `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` remains equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.
