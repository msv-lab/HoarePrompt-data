Output State: **`l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`, `h` is equal to `mid`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `(mid_sum - left) is greater than or equal to (right - mid_next_sum)`**

Explanation:
- `h` is updated to the value of `mid`.
- The other variables (`l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `l` must be less than `h` is still valid because `l` is less than the previous `h`, and `mid` was calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, which is always less than `h` if `l < h`.
- The condition `(mid_sum - left) is greater than or equal to (right - mid_next_sum)` remains valid as the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are not affected by the update to `h`.
