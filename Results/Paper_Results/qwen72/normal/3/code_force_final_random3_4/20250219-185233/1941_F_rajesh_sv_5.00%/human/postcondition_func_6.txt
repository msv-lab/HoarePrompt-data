The function `func_6` takes no explicit parameters but internally uses values and lists returned by `func_4`. It identifies the largest and second largest differences between consecutive elements in a sorted list `A` of integers. It then iterates through a list `F` of function complexities, using a binary search approach to find the optimal model complexity from a sorted list `D` of unique model complexities that minimizes the maximum difference between the adjusted model complexities and the largest gap in `A`. Finally, it prints the maximum of the minimized gap and the second largest gap in `A`.
