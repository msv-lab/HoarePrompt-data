Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, as returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists), `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, as returned by `func_4()`, `k` must be greater than 0, `f` is the first element in `F`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists), `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` if `l` is equal to `h`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `D` must have at least two elements, `l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than or equal to the value that minimizes the difference `right - (D[l] + f)`, and `h` is equal to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the largest element less than or equal to the midpoint between `left - f` and `right - f`, `h` is equal to `l`, `mid` is `l`, `mid_sum` is `D[l] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + 1] + f` if `l + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, otherwise `mid_next_sum` is undefined. If `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`l` and `h` are indices in `D`, `l` is no longer less than `h`, `mid` is equal to the final value of `l`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[l] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is either `D[l + 1] + f` if `l + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, or undefined if `l + 1` is out of bounds. If `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
