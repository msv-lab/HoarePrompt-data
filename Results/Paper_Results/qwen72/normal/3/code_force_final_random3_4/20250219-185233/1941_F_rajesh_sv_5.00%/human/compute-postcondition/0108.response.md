Postcondition: ***`l` and `h` are indices in `D`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.***
