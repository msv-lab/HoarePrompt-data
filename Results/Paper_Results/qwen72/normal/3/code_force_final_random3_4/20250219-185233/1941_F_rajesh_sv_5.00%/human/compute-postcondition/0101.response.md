Output State: **`l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`, `h` is equal to `mid`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation: The value of `h` is updated to `mid`. The other variables (`l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`) remain unchanged. The condition that `l` must be less than `h` is still valid.
