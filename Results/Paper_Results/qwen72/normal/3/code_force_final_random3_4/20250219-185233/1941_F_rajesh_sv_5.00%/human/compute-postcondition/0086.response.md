The only object in the loop head is the variable `f`, and it is being iterated over the list `F`. Therefore, the state of `f` needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `f` was the current element in `F` being processed. For the next iteration, `f` will be the next element in `F`.

State: **`l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the largest element less than or equal to the midpoint between `left - f` and `right - f`, `h` is equal to `l`, `mid` is `l`, `mid_sum` is `D[l] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + 1] + f` if `l + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, otherwise `mid_next_sum` is undefined. If `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `f` is the next element in `F`**
