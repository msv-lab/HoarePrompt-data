Output State: **`l` is now `mid + 1`, `h` is an index in `D` and is greater than `l`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.** 

The value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`. The other variables `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` retain their previous values and relationships. The condition that `l` must be less than `h` is still valid, but now `l` is specifically `mid + 1`.
