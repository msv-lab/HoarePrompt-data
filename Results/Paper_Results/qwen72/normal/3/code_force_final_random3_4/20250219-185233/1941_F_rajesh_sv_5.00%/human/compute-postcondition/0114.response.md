To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved step by step:

1. **List `A`**:
   - `A` is a list of `n` integers where each element `A[i]` satisfies \(1 \leq A[i] \leq 2 \times 10^9\).
   - The list is sorted in ascending order, meaning \(A[i] < A[i+1]\).
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Variables `m` and `k`**:
   - `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`. The exact values of `m` and `k` depend on the implementation of `func_4()`, but we know they are integers.

3. **List `D`**:
   - `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where each element `D[i]` satisfies \(1 \leq D[i] \leq 10^9\).

4. **List `F`**:
   - `F` is a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where each element `F[i]` satisfies \(1 \leq F[i] \leq 10^9\).
   - `F` is returned by `func_4()`.

5. **Variable `max_diff`**:
   - `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`.

6. **Variable `next_max_diff`**:
   - `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists).

7. **Variable `index`**:
   - `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs.

8. **Variables `left` and `right`**:
   - `left` is `A[index - 1]`.
   - `right` is `A[index]`.

9. **Variable `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` for each `f` in `F` where `l` is the index in `D` that minimizes the difference `right - (D[l] + f)`.

Given the above initial state, let's analyze the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement:

- **`max_diff` and `next_max_diff`**:
  - `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`.
  - `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists).

- **`ans`**:
  - `ans` is calculated based on the differences between elements in `A` and elements in `D` and `F`.
  - The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `A`, `D`, and `F`, but it is the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum of the calculated differences.

- **`max(ans, next_max_diff)`**:
  - The `print` statement will output the maximum of `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `D`, and `F` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans` or `next_max_diff`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` for each `f` in `F` where `l` is the index in `D` that minimizes the difference `right - (D[l] + f)`, and `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` if it exists)**
