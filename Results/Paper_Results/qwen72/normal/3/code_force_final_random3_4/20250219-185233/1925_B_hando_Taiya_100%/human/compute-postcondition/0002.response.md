To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
```

Here, the variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The function `isqrt(x)` returns the integer square root of `x`, which is the largest integer `y` such that `y^2 <= x`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range` function and will start at 1.
2. **Variable `x`**: This variable is used to determine the upper bound of the range. The loop will execute if `isqrt(x) + 1` is greater than 1, which means `isqrt(x)` must be at least 1.
3. **Function `isqrt(x)`**: For `isqrt(x)` to be at least 1, `x` must be at least 1. Since `x` is already given to be in the range 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, this condition is always satisfied.

### Adjustments:
- `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.
- `x` should be at least 1 to ensure `isqrt(x)` is at least 1, but this is already given by the problem constraints.
- The loop will execute as long as `isqrt(x) + 1` is greater than 1, which is always true for the given range of `x`.

### Final State:
Since `x` is already within the required range and `i` will be 1 at the start of the loop, no additional adjustments are needed. The state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
