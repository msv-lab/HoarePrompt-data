It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take two parameters, `x` and `n`, which represent the difficulty of the original problem and the number of sub-problems, respectively. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```python
def max_balance(x, n):
```

Precondition: **x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.**
