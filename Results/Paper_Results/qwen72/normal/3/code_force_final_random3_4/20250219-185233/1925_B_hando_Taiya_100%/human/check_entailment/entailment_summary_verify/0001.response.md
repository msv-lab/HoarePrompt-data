### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires breaking a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Approach**:
   - The GCD of `n` sub-problems is maximized when the sub-problems have the same difficulty, which is `x // n` if `x` is divisible by `n`.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - In `func_1`, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` (using `isqrt` from the `math` module).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code correctly identifies the divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - It updates `ans` with the maximum possible GCD that can be achieved.
   - The use of `isqrt` to limit the range of divisors is efficient and correct.
   - The logic for updating `ans` is correct and ensures that the maximum GCD is found.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only possible way to break `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1, which gives a GCD of 1. The code correctly handles this case.
   - For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the code correctly finds that the maximum GCD is 2, which can be achieved with sub-problems of difficulties 4, 2, and 4.
   - For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the code correctly finds that the maximum GCD is 6, which can be achieved with sub-problems of difficulties 6, 6, ..., 6 (69 times).

### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` from the user input, where `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8` and `1 ≤ n ≤ x`.
- It then calculates and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.
- The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed value of the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Evaluation:
- The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`.
- The original assessment accurately explains the logic and correctness of the program.
- The program handles the problem as described and correctly finds the maximum GCD for the given test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
