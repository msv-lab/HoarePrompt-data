Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` from the user input, where `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8` and `1 ≤ n ≤ x`. It then calculates and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed value of the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`. **
