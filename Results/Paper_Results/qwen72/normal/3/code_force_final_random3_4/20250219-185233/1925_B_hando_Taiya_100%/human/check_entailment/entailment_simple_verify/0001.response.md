### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Approach**:
   - The GCD of `n` sub-problems is maximized when the sub-problems have the same difficulty, which is `x // n` if `x` is divisible by `n`.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - In `func_1`, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` (using `isqrt` from the `math` module).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Divisor Identification**: The code correctly identifies the divisors of `x` by iterating up to the integer square root of `x` and checking if `x % i == 0`.
   - **GCD Calculation**: The code updates `ans` with the maximum possible GCD that can be achieved by checking if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and `i`.
   - **Efficiency**: The use of `isqrt` to limit the range of divisors is efficient and correct, as it reduces the number of iterations needed to find divisors.
   - **Logic for Updating `ans`**: The logic for updating `ans` is correct and ensures that the maximum GCD is found. Specifically, it checks both `i` and `x // i` to ensure that the largest possible divisor is considered.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only possible way to break `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1, which gives a GCD of 1. The code correctly handles this case.
   - **Case 2**: For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the code correctly finds that the maximum GCD is 2, which can be achieved with sub-problems of difficulties 4, 2, and 4.
   - **Case 3**: For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the code correctly finds that the maximum GCD is 6, which can be achieved with sub-problems of difficulties 6, 6, ..., 6 (69 times).

6. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The final state of `ans` is indeed the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`, which is the correct solution for the problem.
