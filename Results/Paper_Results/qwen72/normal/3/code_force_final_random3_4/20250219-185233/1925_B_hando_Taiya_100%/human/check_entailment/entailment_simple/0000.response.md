### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a divisor, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The goal is to find the maximum balance, which is the GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems.
   - The balance is maximized when the difficulties of the sub-problems are as large as possible and still sum up to `x`.
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - The program updates `ans` to the largest divisor of `x` that can be used to form `n` sub-problems, which is the correct approach to maximize the GCD.
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is equal to `x` or `n` is 1 correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, the maximum balance is `x` itself, which is correctly handled by the program.
   - For `n = x`, the maximum balance is 1, which is also correctly handled by the program.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program efficiently checks divisors up to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for finding divisors.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
