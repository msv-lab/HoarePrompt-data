Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), the current value of `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by `i` (i.e., `n <= x // i`), and `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // 1` (i.e., `ans` is `x`).**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value (1) and `x // i`.
- Since `i` is 1, `x // i` is equal to `x`.
- Therefore, `ans` is now equal to `x`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
