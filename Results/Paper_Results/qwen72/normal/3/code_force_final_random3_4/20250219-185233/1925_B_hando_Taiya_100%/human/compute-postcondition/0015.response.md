Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is 2. If `n` ≤ 2, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 2`. If `x` is divisible by 2 and `n` is less than or equal to `x // 2`, then `ans` is set to `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
