You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` from the user input, where `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8` and `1 ≤ n ≤ x`. It then calculates and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed value of the largest divisor of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Approach**:
   - The GCD of `n` sub-problems is maximized when the sub-problems have the same difficulty, which is `x // n` if `x` is divisible by `n`.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - In `func_1`, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` (using `isqrt` from the `math` module).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code correctly identifies the divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - It updates `ans` with the maximum possible GCD that can be achieved.
   - The use of `isqrt` to limit the range of divisors is efficient and correct.
   - The logic for updating `ans` is correct and ensures that the maximum GCD is found.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only possible way to break `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1, which gives a GCD of 1. The code correctly handles this case.
   - For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the code correctly finds that the maximum GCD is 2, which can be achieved with sub-problems of difficulties 4, 2, and 4.
   - For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the code correctly finds that the maximum GCD is 6, which can be achieved with sub-problems of difficulties 6, 6, ..., 6 (69 times).

The given program is correct and handles the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
