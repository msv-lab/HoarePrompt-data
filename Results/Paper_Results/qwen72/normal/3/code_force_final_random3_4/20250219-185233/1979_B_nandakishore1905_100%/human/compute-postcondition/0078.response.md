Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and must not be a power of 2 plus \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is \(k - 2^p - q\), `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `f` is updated to `f - q`.
- `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
- Therefore, the new value of `f` is \(k - 2^p - q\).
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `f` is used to update `l` and `p` accordingly.
