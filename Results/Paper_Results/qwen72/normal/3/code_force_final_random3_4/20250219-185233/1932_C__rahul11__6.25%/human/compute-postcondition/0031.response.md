Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**

Explanation: The code snippet `res[c] = ans % m % MOD` updates the value of `res[c]` to `ans % m % MOD`. The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, `ans`, and `l` remain unchanged. The initial state already specifies that `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, so this value is confirmed and remains the same after the code execution.
