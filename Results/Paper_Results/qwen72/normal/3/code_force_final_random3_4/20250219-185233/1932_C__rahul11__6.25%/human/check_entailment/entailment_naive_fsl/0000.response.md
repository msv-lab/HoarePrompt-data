Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the division of the product when an element is removed. Specifically, the use of `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `ans // arr[r] % MOD` can lead to incorrect results because integer division does not always yield the correct inverse in modular arithmetic. This can cause the product to be incorrectly reduced, especially when the array elements are large and the modulus is not a prime number.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```
The expected output is:
```
0 2 4 1
```
However, the program might produce an incorrect output because of the way it handles division in modular arithmetic. Specifically, when the first element (3) is removed, the product should be divided by 3, but `ans // arr[l] % MOD` might not yield the correct result due to the non-prime nature of the modulus 6.

To fix this, the program should use modular multiplicative inverses or a different approach to correctly handle the division in modular arithmetic.
