Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`.
- The value of `l` is 1, so `arr[l]` is `arr[1]`.
- The value of `c` is `c + 1`, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The initial condition that `n` is greater than 1 and `k` is 1 is still valid.
- The initial condition that `c` is `c + 1` is still valid, and `res[c]` is updated accordingly.
- The value of `res[c]` is now `ans % m % MOD`, where `ans` is the new value after the division and modulo operation.
