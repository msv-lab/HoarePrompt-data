Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 2, `c` is incremented by 1, `res[c-1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.***
