Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is incremented by 1, the values of `l`, `r`, and `res[c]` remain unchanged, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.** 

The value of `ans` is updated by performing integer division of `ans` by `arr[r]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The other variables, `n`, `k`, `c`, `l`, `r`, and `res[c]`, remain unchanged from their initial states.
