The code snippet `ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD` updates the value of `ans` by performing integer division of `ans` by `arr[r]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `s` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, the character at index `k` in the string `s` is not 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`**
