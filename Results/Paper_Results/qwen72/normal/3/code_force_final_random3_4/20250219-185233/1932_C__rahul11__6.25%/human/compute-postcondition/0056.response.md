Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `n - 1`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `i`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - l`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `i` is the first element in `arr`**

Explanation:
- `ans` is initially 1 and is then multiplied by `i`, which is the first element in `arr`.
- After the multiplication, `ans` is now equal to `i`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, `res`, `l`, `r`, `arr`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged.
