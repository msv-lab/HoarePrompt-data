Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Modulo Operation**: The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6` which is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem. The problem only requires taking the modulo `m` at each step, not an additional modulo `10 ** 9 + 6`.

2. **Division and Modulo**: The program attempts to divide the product `ans` by the element being removed and then takes the modulo. This approach can lead to incorrect results because division does not distribute over modulo in the same way as multiplication. Specifically, `ans // arr[l] % m` is not the same as `(ans % m) // (arr[l] % m) % m`.

3. **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product calculation should be done modulo `m` to avoid overflow and to ensure the product remains manageable.

4. **Handling Division**: To correctly handle the division of the product modulo `m`, you should use the modular inverse of the element being removed. This is because division in modular arithmetic is equivalent to multiplication by the modular inverse.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def modinv(a, m):
    # Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse
    if gcd(a, m) != 1:
        raise ValueError("Modular inverse does not exist")
    m0, x0, x1 = m, 0, 1
    while a > 1:
        q = a // m
        m, a = a % m, m
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    if x1 < 0:
        x1 += m0
    return x1

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * modinv(arr[l], m)) % m
                res[k + 1] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * modinv(arr[r], m)) % m
                res[k + 1] = ans
                r -= 1
        print(*res)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The `modinv` function calculates the modular inverse of a number using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This is necessary to correctly perform the division in modular arithmetic.
2. **Initial Product Calculation**: The initial product is calculated modulo `m` to avoid overflow.
3. **Processing Commands**: For each command, the program updates the product by multiplying it with the modular inverse of the element being removed, and then takes the modulo `m` to get the correct result.

This corrected program should now work correctly for the given problem description.
