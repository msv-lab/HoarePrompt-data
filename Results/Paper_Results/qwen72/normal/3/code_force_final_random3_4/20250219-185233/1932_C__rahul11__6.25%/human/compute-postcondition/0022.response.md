Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, the character at the 0th index of the string `s` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is 1.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
