Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` is `n - 2`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is the final value of `ans` after all updates, `res` is a list where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is updated to `ans % m % MOD` based on the conditions of `s[k]`, `l` is the final value of `l` after all increments, `r` is the final value of `r` after all decrements, `arr` is a list of integers provided as input, and `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input.**

The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `c`, `ans`, `res`, `l`, `r`, and `m`) remain unchanged. The input values for `n` and `m` are still assigned, and the conditions for updating `res` and the values of `l` and `r` remain as specified in the initial state.
