Output State: **`n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` or `r` is updated accordingly, `res[c]` is updated based on the first element of `s` and the new value of `ans`.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1.
- `k` remains 2.
- `c` is incremented by 1.
- `ans` is updated to the result of `ans // arr[l] % MOD`.
- `l` or `r` is updated based on the logic that is not provided in the snippet, but it is implied that one of them is updated.
- `res[c]` is updated based on the first element of `s` and the new value of `ans`.
