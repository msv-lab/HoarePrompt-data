Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0. If the character at the 0th index of the string `s` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is 1. Otherwise, if the character at the 0th index of the string `s` is not 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `r` is `r - 1`.***
