Output State: **`n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `l` or `r` is updated accordingly, `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1.
- `k` remains 2.
- `c` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `c + 1`.
- `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
- `l` or `r` is updated accordingly, but the specific update is not provided in the code snippet.
- `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`, which simplifies to `ans % m` since `MOD` is applied twice.
