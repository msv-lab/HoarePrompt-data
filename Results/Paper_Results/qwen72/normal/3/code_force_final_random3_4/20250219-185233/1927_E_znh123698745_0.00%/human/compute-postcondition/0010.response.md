Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is even, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `(-1` is an incomplete expression.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value of `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`.
- `a[0]` is 1, so `array[a[0]]` is `array[1]`.
- Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `array[1]` is 2.
- Therefore, `answer` is now a list containing the integers 1 and 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
