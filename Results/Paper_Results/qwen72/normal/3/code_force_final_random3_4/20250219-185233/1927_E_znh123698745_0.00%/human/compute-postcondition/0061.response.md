Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[-1]`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`.
- `a[-1]` is -1, which refers to the last element of the list `array`.
- Since `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the last element of `array` is `n`.
- Therefore, `array[-1]` is `n`.
- `answer` was initially `[1]`, and after appending `n`, it becomes `[1, n]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `array` remain unchanged.
