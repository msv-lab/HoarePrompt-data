Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is even, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `n`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `(-1)` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`.
- `a[-1]` is -1, so `array[a[-1]]` is `array[-1]`, which is the last element of `array`.
- Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the last element of `array` is `n`.
- Therefore, `answer` now contains the integers 1 and `n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
