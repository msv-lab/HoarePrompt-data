Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is even, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in reverse order, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `k`**: These remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`array`**: This list remains unchanged as it is only accessed, not modified.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- **`answer`**: The loop appends elements to `answer` in a specific pattern. For odd `i`, it appends the element at the index `a[-1]` (which starts at `-1` and decreases by 1 each time an odd `i` is encountered). For even `i`, it appends the element at the index `a[0]` (which starts at `1` and increases by 1 each time an even `i` is encountered). This results in `answer` containing the integers from 1 to `n` in reverse order.
- **`a`**: The list `a` is modified within the loop. For odd `i`, `a[-1]` is decremented, and for even `i`, `a[0]` is incremented. After `n-1` iterations, `a[0]` will be `n` (since it starts at 1 and is incremented `n/2` times) and `a[-1]` will be `-n` (since it starts at -1 and is decremented `(n-1)/2` times).
