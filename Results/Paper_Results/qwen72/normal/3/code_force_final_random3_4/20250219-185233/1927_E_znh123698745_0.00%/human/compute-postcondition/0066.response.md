Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `array` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `(-1) ** i` is -1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[-1]`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2. Otherwise, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `a` is a list containing the integers 2 and -1.***
