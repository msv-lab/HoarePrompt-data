The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
