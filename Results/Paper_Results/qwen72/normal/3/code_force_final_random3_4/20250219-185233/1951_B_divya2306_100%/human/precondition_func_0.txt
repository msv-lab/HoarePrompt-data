The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `ratings` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and an integer `k` representing the index of your cow. The length of `ratings` is `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. Each rating in `ratings` is a distinct integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
