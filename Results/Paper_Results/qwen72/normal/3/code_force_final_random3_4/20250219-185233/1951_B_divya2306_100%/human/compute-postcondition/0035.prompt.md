Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ratings` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the `ratings` list, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is a list of integers, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the beginning of the list up to the first element that is greater than `a[k - 1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists, `wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    win_with_swap += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ratings` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the `ratings` list, `t` is the number of test cases, `a` is a list of integers, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the beginning of the list up to the first element that is greater than `a[k - 1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists, `wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 2` and `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`. If the element at index `i` in `a` is greater than the element at index `k - 1` in `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `win_with_swap` is increased by 1, `k` remains unchanged. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `win_with_swap + 2`, `win_with_swap` is increased by 1, `k` remains unchanged, and `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`. If `a[i]` > `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
