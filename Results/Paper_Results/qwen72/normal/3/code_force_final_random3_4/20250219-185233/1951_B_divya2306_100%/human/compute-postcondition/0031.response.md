The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the relationship between `i` and `k - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `win_with_swap` is increased by 1.
- `k` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be less than `k - 1`.
- `win_with_swap` is the starting point for `i` in the next iteration, so it must also be less than `k - 1`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1` and `i` must be `win_with_swap + 1`.

State: **`i` is `win_with_swap + 1`, `win_with_swap` is increased by 1, `k` remains unchanged, and `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`**
