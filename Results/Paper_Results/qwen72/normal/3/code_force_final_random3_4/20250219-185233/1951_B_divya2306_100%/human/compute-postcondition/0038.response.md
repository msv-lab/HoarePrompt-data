Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes a list of integers `ratings` and an integer `k` to determine the relative standing of the cow at index `k-1` based on the ratings. Specifically, it counts the number of cows with ratings less than or equal to the cow at index `k-1` from the beginning of the list up to the first cow with a higher rating. If this count is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints the count minus one. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of cows that can be swapped with the cow at index `k-1` to increase its standing and prints this value. The function does not return any value. **
