The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Output State: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `ratings` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and an integer `k` representing the index of your cow. The length of `ratings` is `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. Each rating in `ratings` is a distinct integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is an integer representing the length of the `ratings` list, and `k` is an integer representing the index of your cow. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
