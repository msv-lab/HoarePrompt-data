### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function processes the list of pile sizes to create a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between the current pile size and the sum of all previous pile sizes in the sorted unique list.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It first sorts the list `a` and removes duplicates to get `a_new`.
     - It then iterates through `a_new` and subtracts the previous element from the current element.
     - The result is a list where each element represents the number of stones that can be removed in a single turn without affecting the subsequent elements.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The transformation is correct because it effectively reduces the problem to a simpler form where each pile size is unique and the game can be analyzed more easily.
     - The final state of `a_new` is a sorted list of unique elements where each element is the difference from the previous elements, which is a valid transformation for the game.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list `a_new` and the number of piles `n`.
   - **Behavior**:
     - If `n` is 1, Alice wins because she can remove all stones in one move.
     - If `n` is 2, Alice wins if the first element of `a` is even, otherwise Bob wins.
     - For `n` greater than 2, it recursively calls itself with the list `a` excluding the first element and `n` decremented by 1.
     - It returns 1 if the recursive call returns 2, or if it returns 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1.
     - Otherwise, it returns 2.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The base cases are correctly handled:
       - If `n` is 1, Alice wins.
       - If `n` is 2, the parity of the first element correctly determines the winner.
     - The recursive case is also correct:
       - If the recursive call returns 2, it means the next player (Bob) will lose, so Alice wins.
       - If the recursive call returns 1 and the first element is not 1, Alice can still win by removing a non-trivial number of stones.
       - If the recursive call returns 1 and the first element is 1, Alice cannot make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position, so Bob wins.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - **Purpose**: This loop reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the winner.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `a`.
     - It calls `func_1` to transform the list `a`.
     - It then calls `func_2` to determine the winner and prints the result.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The input handling is correct and follows the problem description.
     - The calls to `func_1` and `func_2` are in the correct order and with the correct parameters.
     - The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem description.
