Postcondition: **`a` is a list of positive integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), and `n` is greater than 1 and not equal to 2. `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`, and `winNext` is either 2 or 1 with the additional condition that if `winNext` is 1, then the first element of `a` is not 1.**
