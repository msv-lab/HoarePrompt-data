### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing the same number of stones from all non-empty piles.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - The goal is to determine the winner assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the list of pile sizes `a` and returns a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between the current element and the sum of all previous elements.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the list into a form that simplifies the game state analysis.
   - The transformation ensures that the smallest pile size is always 1, and the other pile sizes are adjusted accordingly.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function recursively determines the winner based on the transformed list `a` and the number of piles `n`.
   - If there is only one pile, Alice wins (returns 1).
   - If there are two piles, Alice wins if the smallest pile size is even, otherwise Bob wins.
   - For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the state of the game after the first pile is removed. If the next state is a win for the opponent or if the first pile size is not 1, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Base Cases**:
     - When `n == 1`, Alice wins because she can always remove all stones from the single pile.
     - When `n == 2`, the winner depends on whether the smallest pile size is even or odd. If even, Alice wins; if odd, Bob wins.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - The function correctly handles the recursive case by checking the state of the game after the first pile is removed. If the next state is a win for the opponent or if the first pile size is not 1, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Transformation**:
     - The transformation in `func_1` ensures that the smallest pile size is always 1, which simplifies the game state analysis and aligns with the problem's constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as a single pile or two piles correctly.
   - The transformation in `func_1` ensures that the input to `func_2` is always valid and within the problem's constraints.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
