The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most 2 times. It returns the minimum value between the number of integers in `a` that appear exactly 2 times and half the total number of integers in `a` (`n // 2`). The function does not modify the input parameters.
