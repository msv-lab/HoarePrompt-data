### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves 2n cards with integers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed equally between you and Nene.
   - You and Nene take turns placing one card on the table, and you score a point if the card you place matches a card already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If you have a pair of cards with the same integer, you can score a point by placing the second card after the first one.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. Therefore, if you place a card that Nene has a matching card for, she will place her matching card immediately to score a point.

3. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` calculates the maximum number of points you can score.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It then counts the number of pairs (`pairs`) in your hand.
   - The function returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This is because you can only score a point for each pair you have, and you can only place `n // 2` cards in your turns.

4. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input data.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` to get the result for the current test case and appends it to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

5. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly counts the pairs in your hand and returns the maximum number of points you can score.
   - The logic in `func_2` is also correct. It correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
