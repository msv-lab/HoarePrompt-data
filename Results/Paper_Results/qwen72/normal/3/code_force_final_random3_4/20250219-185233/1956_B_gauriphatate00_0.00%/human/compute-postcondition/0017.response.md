Output State: **`func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value `3 + n + n`. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1 - n]`. `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index `idx - n` in `data`. `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`. `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. The result of `func_1(n, a)` is appended to the `results` list.**

In simpler terms:
- `data` remains the list of strings read from `sys.stdin`.
- `idx` remains `3 + n + n`.
- `t` remains the integer value of `data[0]` and must still be greater than 0.
- `n` remains the integer value of `data[idx - 1 - n]`.
- `a` remains the list of `n` integers starting from the element at index `idx - n` in `data`.
- `results` now contains the result of `func_1(n, a)` appended to it.
- `_` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `_ + 1`.
- `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.
