To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the variable `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`.
- `idx` is assigned the value `2 + n`.
- `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index 2 in `data`.

The loop head is:
```
for _ in range(t):
```

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- The loop counter `_` must be incremented by 1.
- The variable `t` must still be greater than 0 after the increment of `_`.

Since `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration and is not explicitly tracked, we can infer that the loop will execute again if `t` is greater than the current value of `_`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

Since the state of `t` is not directly modified by the loop, we only need to adjust `_` and ensure that `t` is still greater than `_`.

State: **`func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value `2 + n`. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`. `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`. `a` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index 2 in `data`. `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.**
