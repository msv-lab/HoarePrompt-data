### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** `n` (the number of cards in the player's hand) and `a` (a list of integers representing the cards in the player's hand).
   - **Behavior:** The function counts the number of pairs (integers that appear exactly twice) in the list `a` and returns the minimum value between the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
   - **Output:** The function returns the maximum number of points the player can score by playing optimally. This is because the player can only score points if they play a card that matches a card already on the table, and the maximum number of such matches is the number of pairs in their hand, up to `n // 2` (since there are only `n` cards in total and each card can only be matched once).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** The function reads from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - **Behavior:** The function reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a`, calls `func_1` with these values, and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.
   - **Output:** The function prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, which is the maximum number of points the player can score for each test case.

### Correctness:
- **Function `func_1`** correctly calculates the maximum number of points the player can score by counting the pairs in their hand and ensuring it does not exceed `n // 2`. This is because the player can only score a point if they play a card that matches a card already on the table, and the maximum number of such matches is the number of pairs in their hand.
- **Function `func_2`** correctly processes multiple test cases, reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results. The input and output handling is appropriate for the problem description.

Given the problem description and the behavior of the functions, the program is correct in solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
