### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - The function uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of cards you have by summing up the counts where the count is 2.
   - It returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. This is because you can only score points for pairs of cards that you have, and you can only play `n // 2` turns optimally (since Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours).

   **Analysis**:
   - The logic of counting pairs and returning the minimum of pairs and `n // 2` is correct. This ensures that you are only considering the pairs you can play optimally.
   - The function correctly handles the case where you have fewer than `n // 2` pairs, as you cannot score more points than the number of pairs you have.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where you have more than `n // 2` pairs, as Nene will play optimally to prevent you from scoring more than `n // 2` points.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - The function reads the entire input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the number of cards `n` and the list of cards `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

   **Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It ensures that the input is split and parsed correctly, and the indices are updated appropriately to handle each test case.
   - The results are printed in the correct format, one per test case.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the problem description, input format, and logic for determining the maximum number of points you can get. It considers the optimal play by both you and Nene, ensuring that the result is accurate for all test cases.

Final: **True**
