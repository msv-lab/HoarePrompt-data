Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
- `results` is a list containing at least one result from `func_1(n, a)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `results`**:
   - `results` is a list that contains at least one result from the function `func_1(n, a)`.
   - The exact contents of `results` are not specified, but we know it contains at least one element.

2. **Variable `result`**:
   - The variable `result` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
   - However, in the context of the code snippet, it is likely that `result` is intended to be an element from the list `results`.

3. **Possible Interpretation**:
   - If `result` is intended to be an element from `results`, the most straightforward interpretation is that `result` is the first element of `results`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `result` is not explicitly defined, but the code snippet is trying to print it, the most reasonable assumption is that `result` is the first element of the list `results`.

### Output:
Output: **result (where result is the first element of the list `results`)**
