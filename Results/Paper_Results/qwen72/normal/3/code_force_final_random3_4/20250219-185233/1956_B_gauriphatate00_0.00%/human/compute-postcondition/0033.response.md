Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results of each test case. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, and the function calls another function `func_1` with these values. The final state of the program after `func_2` concludes is that all results from `func_1` for each test case have been printed to the standard output. **
