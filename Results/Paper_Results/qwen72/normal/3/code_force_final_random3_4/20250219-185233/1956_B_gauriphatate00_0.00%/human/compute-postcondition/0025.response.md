To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element. The other variables mentioned in the state before the loop, such as `data`, `idx`, `t`, and `a`, are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop, we need to ensure that `results` is a list that contains at least one result from `func_1(n, a)`.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one result from `func_1(n, a)`**
