Output State: **`func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. `idx` is assigned the value `4 + n + n`. `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than the new value of `_`. `n` is now assigned the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. `a` is now a list of `n` integers starting from the element at index `idx - n - 1` in `data`. `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`. `_` is incremented by 1.**
