To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `results` is a list containing at least three results from `func_1(n, a)`.
   - `result` is the third result in the list `results`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet is `print(result)`.

3. **Explanation**:
   - Since `results` is a list containing at least three results from the function `func_1(n, a)`, we know that `results` has at least three elements.
   - The variable `result` is assigned the value of the third element in the list `results`. In Python, list indices are zero-based, so the third element is at index 2.
   - Therefore, `result` will be `results[2]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of the third element in the list `results`.

Output: **results[2] (where results[2] is the third result from the function `func_1(n, a)`)**
