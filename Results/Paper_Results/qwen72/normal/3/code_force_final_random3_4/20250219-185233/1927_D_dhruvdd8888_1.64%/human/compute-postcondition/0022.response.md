Postcondition: ***`N` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the second integer in the list `nums`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `s` is 2 and `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2, num)`. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list.***
