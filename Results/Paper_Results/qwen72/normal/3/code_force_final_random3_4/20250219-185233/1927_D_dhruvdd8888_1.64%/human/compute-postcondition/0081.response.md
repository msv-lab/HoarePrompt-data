Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **`l` and `r` are updated to the new input integers**: This means `l` and `r` have been set to some new values, but these values are not specified in the initial state.

2. **`s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`**: This means `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. However, the values of `s` and `e` are not directly relevant to the print statement.

3. **`tc > 5`**: This indicates that `tc` is a variable with a value greater than 5, but it is not used in the print statement.

4. **`ppp` is either 23 or not 23**: This indicates that `ppp` can be either 23 or any other value, but it is not used in the print statement.

5. **`eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order**: This means `eli` is determined by the sorted order of the list `arr`, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement explicitly prints the integers `-1` and `-1`. The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, `tc`, `ppp`, and `eli` do not affect the output of this print statement.

Output: **-1, -1**
