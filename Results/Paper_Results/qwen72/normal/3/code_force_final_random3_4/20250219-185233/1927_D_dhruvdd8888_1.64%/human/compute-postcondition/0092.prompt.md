You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of the array a, followed by n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array a. The next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of queries. Each of the following q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `N` is the input integer, `i` is `N`, `s` is the index of the last occurrence of the last unique number in `nums` before `-1`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last integer in the list `nums` (which is `-1`), `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a segment in `nums` and the value of the segment, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: [list of integers read from the next line of input, followed by -1]
    #State: *`N` is the input integer, `i` is `N`, `s` is the index of the last occurrence of the last unique number in `nums` before `-1`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last integer in the list `nums` (which is `-1`), `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a segment in `nums` and the value of the segment, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `nums` is a list of integers read from the next line of input with `-1` appended to it. If `ppp` is 23, the program retains all these conditions.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The input integer for the loop is 0 (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `l` and `r` are the last set of integers provided by the user, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order. If `tc > 5`, the loop has continued to the next iteration for all iterations where this condition was true. If `ppp` is 23, the loop has printed `l` and `r` for all iterations where `tc > 5` and `ppp` is 23. The values of `s` and `e` have been updated based on the conditions within the loop for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it returns the result of an operation performed on a subarray of `a` and writes the results to standard output.
