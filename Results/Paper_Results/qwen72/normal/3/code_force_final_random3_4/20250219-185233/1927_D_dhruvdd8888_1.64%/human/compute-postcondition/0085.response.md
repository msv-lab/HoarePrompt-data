Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` and `r` are updated to new input integers.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `tc > 5`.
   - `ppp` is either 23 or not 23.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s, e + 1)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `eli` is determined by the position where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `min(eli, LA)` ensures that the index used to access the tuple in `arr` is the minimum of `eli` and `LA`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - The `print` statement outputs `s` and `e + 1`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `s` and `e` are elements of a tuple in the list `arr`, their values depend on the specific tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - The value of `e + 1` is simply the second element of the tuple plus 1.

Given the initial state, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `s` and `e` without knowing the specific contents of the list `arr` and the value of `LA`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s and e are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`)**
