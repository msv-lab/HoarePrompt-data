Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` and `r` are updated to new input integers.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `tc > 5`.
   - `ppp` is either 23 or not 23.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The key variables here are `s` and `e`, which are derived from the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - `LA` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is likely the length of the list `arr` (i.e., `len(arr)`).

4. **Determine `eli`:**
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. This means `eli` is the position in `arr` where the first element of the tuple is greater than or equal to `l`.

5. **Determine `min(eli, LA)`:**
   - `min(eli, LA)` will be the smaller of `eli` and the length of `arr`. This ensures that the index is within the bounds of the list.

6. **Determine `s` and `e`:**
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

7. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement will output `s - 1` and `s`.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `arr`, and `LA` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and their relationships.

Output: **(s - 1, s) (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in the list arr, and eli is the index where the tuple (l, 0, 0) would be inserted in arr to maintain sorted order)**
