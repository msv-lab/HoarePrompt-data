Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `a[1]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `a[2]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- The value of `i` is 2, so `a[2]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `ans`, `a[0]`, `a[1]`) remain unchanged or retain their updated values from the initial state.
