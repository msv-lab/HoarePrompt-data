Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `m = min(a)` updates the value of `m` to be the smallest integer in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `m`.
