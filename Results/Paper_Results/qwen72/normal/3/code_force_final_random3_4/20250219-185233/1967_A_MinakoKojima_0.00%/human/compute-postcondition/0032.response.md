Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0 initially.**

The code snippet `m = min(a)` updates the variable `m` to be the smallest integer in the list `a`. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `m` is now the smallest integer in the list `a`, while the rest of the variables retain their initial values.
