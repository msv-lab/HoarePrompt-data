Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `m * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * (a[3] - a[2])`, `i` is 3**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`.
- Since `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`.
- Given that `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, `a[3]` and `a[2]` are both equal to `m`.
- Therefore, `a[3] - a[2]` is `m - m`, which is 0.
- The new value of `ans` is `m * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * 0`, which simplifies to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
