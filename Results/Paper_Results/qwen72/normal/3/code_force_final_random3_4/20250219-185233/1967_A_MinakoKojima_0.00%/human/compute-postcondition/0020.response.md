The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` must start from 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `_` is 0
- `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`
- `k` is 0
- `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`
- `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`
- `ans` is equal to `m`

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is greater than 1 and `i` starts from 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `m`, `i` is 1**
