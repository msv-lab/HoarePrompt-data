Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code).
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.
- `ans` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
if k >= n * m:
    ans = factorial(n)
else:
    k = k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
    ans = 1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        ans *= a[i + 1] - a[i]
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Check the Condition:**
   - The code first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`.
   - If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to the factorial of `n`.

2. **If Condition is True:**
   - `ans` is set to the factorial of `n`.
   - The factorial of `n` is the product of all positive integers up to `n`.

3. **If Condition is False:**
   - If `k < n * m`, then the following steps are executed:
     - `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`.
     - This step involves calculating a new value for `k` by subtracting the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m + k // n - a[i]` for each element `a[i]` in the list `a`.
     - Each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is then updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
     - After updating the list `a`, `ans` is initialized to 1.
     - `ans` is then updated to the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a` from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`.

### Determining the Output:

- **If `k >= n * m`:**
  - `ans` will be the factorial of `n`.
  - The output will be the factorial of `n`.

- **If `k < n * m`:**
  - The value of `k` is updated based on the sum of the minimum values.
  - Each element `a[i]` is updated to a new value.
  - `ans` is then set to the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a`.
  - The output will be the product of these differences.

### Final Output:

- If `k >= n * m`, the output will be the factorial of `n`.
- If `k < n * m`, the output will be the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans` in the second case. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the factorial of n if k >= n * m, or the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list a if k < n * m)**
