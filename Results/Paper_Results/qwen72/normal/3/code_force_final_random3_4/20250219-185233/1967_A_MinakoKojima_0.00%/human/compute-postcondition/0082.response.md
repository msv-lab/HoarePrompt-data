Let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
if k >= n * m:
    ans = factorial(n)
else:
    if n > 1:
        ans = ans * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])
        i = n - 1
    else:
        ans = a[0]
        i = 0

print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `m`**:
   - `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.

2. **Evaluate the condition `k >= n * m`**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is set to the factorial of `n`.
   - If `k` is less than `n * m`, we proceed to the next condition.

3. **Evaluate the condition `n > 1`**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, then `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, and `i` is set to `n - 1`.
   - If `n` is 1, then `ans` is set to the first element of the list `a`, and `i` is set to 0.

4. **Print `ans`**:
   - The value of `ans` is printed based on the conditions evaluated.

### Possible Outputs:
- **Case 1: `k >= n * m`**:
  - `ans` is the factorial of `n`.
  - Output: **factorial(n)**

- **Case 2: `k < n * m` and `n > 1`**:
  - `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`.
  - Output: **ans * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])** (where `ans` is the initial value of `ans` and `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]` are the elements at the specified indices in the list `a`).

- **Case 3: `k < n * m` and `n == 1`**:
  - `ans` is set to the first element of the list `a`.
  - Output: **a[0]** (where `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`).

### Final Output:
Based on the given initial state and the logic of the code, the output will be one of the following:

- **If `k >= n * m`**:
  - Output: **factorial(n)**

- **If `k < n * m` and `n > 1`**:
  - Output: **ans * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])** (where `ans` is the initial value of `ans` and `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]` are the elements at the specified indices in the list `a`).

- **If `k < n * m` and `n == 1`**:
  - Output: **a[0]** (where `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`).

Output: **ans (where ans is either factorial(n) if k >= n * m, or ans * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]) if k < n * m and n > 1, or a[0] if k < n * m and n == 1)**
