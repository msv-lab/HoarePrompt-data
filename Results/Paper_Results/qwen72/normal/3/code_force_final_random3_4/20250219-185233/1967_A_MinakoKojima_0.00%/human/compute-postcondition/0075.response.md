Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is now `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is now `ans * (a[1] - a[0])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[1] - a[0])`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `m`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state of `ans` was the first element of the list `a`, and now it is multiplied by the difference between the second element and the first element of the list `a`.
