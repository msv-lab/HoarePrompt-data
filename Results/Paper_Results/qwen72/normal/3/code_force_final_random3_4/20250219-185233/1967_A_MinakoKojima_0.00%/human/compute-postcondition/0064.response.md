Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is now `k - n * m`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `a[i]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- The value of `k` is already defined as `k - n * m`.
- The value of `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `a[i]` depends on the current values of `k`, `m`, `n`, and `a[i]`.
