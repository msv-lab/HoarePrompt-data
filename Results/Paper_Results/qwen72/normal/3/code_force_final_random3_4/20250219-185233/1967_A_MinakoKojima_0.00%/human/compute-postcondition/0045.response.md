Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` is the number of iterations the loop has run, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, and each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variable `n` is the number of iterations the loop has run, and it must be greater than or equal to the length of the list `a`.
- The variable `k` is updated by subtracting the sum of the minimum values between `k` and `m + k // n - a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The list `a` is updated such that each element `a[i]` is set to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `m` remains the smallest integer in the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` remains 0.
- The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state of `a` and `k` reflects the updates made during each iteration.
