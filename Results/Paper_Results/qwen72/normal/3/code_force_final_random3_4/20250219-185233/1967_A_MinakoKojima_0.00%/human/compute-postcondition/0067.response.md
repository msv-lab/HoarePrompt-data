Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is now `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `a[1]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `a[i]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` and `a[1]` are already updated in the initial state, so they remain the same.
- The new value of `a[i]` is calculated based on the current values of `m`, `k`, `n`, and `a[i]`.
