Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is `math.factorial(n)`, and `k` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `m`.**

The value of `ans` is updated to the factorial of `n`, which is calculated using the `math.factorial` function. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
