Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = a[0]` assigns the value of the first element in the list `a` to the variable `ans`. Since each element in the list `a` is `m`, and `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is now equal to `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.
