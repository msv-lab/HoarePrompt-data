Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `m * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, `i` is `n-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` must be greater than 0, indicating that the list `a` has at least one element.
- The variable `k` remains 0.
- The list `a` consists of integers where each element is `m`, and `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` is updated in each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `ans` will be the product of `m` and the differences between consecutive elements of the list `a` from the first to the last element.
- The loop index `i` will be `n-1` after the loop has completed all its iterations, indicating that the loop has run from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
