Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `m * (a[1] - a[0])`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with the difference between the second element (`a[1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the list `a`. Since `a` is a list where each element is `m`, the difference `a[1] - a[0]` is `m - m`, which equals 0. Therefore, `ans` becomes `m * 0`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
