Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, and `i` is `n - 6` and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` updates the value of `ans[i]` to be `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.
- The initial state specifies that `ans[i]` was already `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, so this update does not change the value of `ans[i]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
