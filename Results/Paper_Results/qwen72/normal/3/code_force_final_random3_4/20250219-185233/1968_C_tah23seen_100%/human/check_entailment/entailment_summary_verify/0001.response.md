### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` which contains the values `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to \(10^9\). This is a valid choice because \(10^9\) is within the allowed range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

3. **Backward Construction:**
   - The function then iterates backward from `i = n - 2` to `i = 0` to construct the array `ans`.
   - For each `i`, it sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This is intended to satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).

4. **Modulo Condition:**
   - The condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) can be rewritten as \(a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i\) for some integer \(k\).
   - The program sets \(a_i\) to \(a_{i+1} - x_i\), which is a valid way to ensure that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) if \(a_{i+1}\) is sufficiently large and \(a_{i+1} - x_i\) is positive.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program ensures that \(a_i\) is always positive by starting with \(a_n = 10^9\) and decrementing by values that are at most 500 (since \(1 \le x_i \le 500\)).
   - This guarantees that \(a_i\) will always be within the range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case, which is the required output.

### Additional Analysis:

- **Function Summary:**
  - The function summary correctly states that `func_1` returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`.
  - However, the summary is incomplete as it does not mention the initialization of `ans` with \(10^9\) and the backward iteration to set the values.

- **Correctness of the Backward Construction:**
  - The backward construction logic is sound. By setting \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\), the program ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) because \(a_{i+1}\) is always larger than \(x_i\) (since \(a_{i+1} = 10^9\) initially and \(x_i \le 500\)).
  - This approach guarantees that the modulo operation will yield the correct remainder \(x_i\).

- **Verification with Example:**
  - For the first test case with `arr = [2, 4, 1]`:
    - `ans` is initialized as `[1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`.
    - After the first iteration: `ans[2] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`.
    - After the second iteration: `ans[1] = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995`.
    - After the third iteration: `ans[0] = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993`.
    - The resulting `ans` is `[999999993, 999999995, 999999999, 1000000000]`.
    - This array satisfies the conditions:
      - \(999999995 \bmod 999999993 = 2\)
      - \(999999999 \bmod 999999995 = 4\)
      - \(1000000000 \bmod 999999999 = 1\)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound, and the constraints are respected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
