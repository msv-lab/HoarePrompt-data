Output State: **The `encoded` string remains unchanged, `char` is still the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list that may or may not have been modified depending on the loop execution, and now includes the character 'z' at the end, `c` is 123. If the loop found a lowercase Latin letter that was not present in `mapping` values, `mapping` contains a new key-value pair where the key is the first such letter and the value is the third character in `encoded`. If no such letter was found, `mapping` remains unchanged.**
