Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary. If the character 'a' is not present in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include the key 'a' mapped to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains an empty dictionary, and `decoded` is an empty list. `c` is 97.***
