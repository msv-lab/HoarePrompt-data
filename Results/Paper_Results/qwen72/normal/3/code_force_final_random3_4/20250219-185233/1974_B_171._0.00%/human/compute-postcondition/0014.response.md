Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` (which is 'b') is not present in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include the key 'a' mapped to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains an empty dictionary, and `decoded` is an empty list.**
