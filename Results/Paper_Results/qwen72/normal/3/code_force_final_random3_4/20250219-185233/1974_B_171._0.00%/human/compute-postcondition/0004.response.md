Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`, and `char` is currently in `mapping`.**

Since `char` is currently in `mapping`, the value of `mapping[char]` is appended to `decoded`. The other variables remain unchanged.
