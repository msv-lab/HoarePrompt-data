The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`, and the range defined by `ord('a')` and `ord('z') + 1`. The loop will execute if the range is valid, meaning it has at least one value. The range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1` is always valid as it spans from 97 to 123, which includes 26 characters (from 'a' to 'z'). Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once, and no adjustment to `c` or the range is necessary.

However, the task specifies that we should adjust the states of objects in the loop head to ensure the loop can execute. Since the range is always valid, the only variable that can be adjusted is `c`, which will start at `ord('a')` (97).

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `c` is `ord('a')` (97)**
