Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is 99, `mapping` contains the key-value pair where the key is 'c' and the value is the third character in `encoded`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of the variables `encoded`, `char`, `decoded`, `c`, and `mapping` remain unchanged. The only impact is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
