Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with the key 'a' mapped to `char`, `decoded` is a list containing the character 'a', and `c` is 97.**

The code snippet `decoded.append(chr(c))` adds the character 'a' to the list `decoded`. The value of `c` is 97, which corresponds to the character 'a' in the ASCII table. Therefore, `decoded` now contains the character 'a'. The other variables and their values remain unchanged.
