The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`. The loop iterates over the range from the ASCII value of 'a' (97) to the ASCII value of 'z' (122). At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 97. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 to 98.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary. If the character 'a' is not present in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include the key 'a' mapped to `char`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `mapping` remains an empty dictionary, and `decoded` is an empty list. `c` is 98.**
