Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. The decoded string is generated by mapping each character in `encoded` to a corresponding lowercase Latin letter. If `encoded` contains more than 26 unique characters, only the last 26 unique characters are mapped to the 26 lowercase Latin letters, and the decoded string will reflect these mappings. The original `encoded` string remains unchanged. **
