Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `encoded`, `decoded` is a list, and `c` is 97. If the character 'a' is not present in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping['a']` is set to `char`, and the character 'a' is now present in the values of `mapping`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `encoded`, `char`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
