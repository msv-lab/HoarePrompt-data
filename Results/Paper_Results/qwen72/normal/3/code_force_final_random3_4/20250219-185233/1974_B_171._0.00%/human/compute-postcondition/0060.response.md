The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`. `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a string that is the result of joining all characters in the `decoded` list, where each character in `decoded` is the corresponding key from `mapping` for the character in `encoded`. If `encoded` has more than 26 unique characters, the last 26 characters of `encoded` will be mapped to the 26 lowercase Latin letters in `mapping`, and the `decoded` list will contain the corresponding keys for all characters in `encoded`.
