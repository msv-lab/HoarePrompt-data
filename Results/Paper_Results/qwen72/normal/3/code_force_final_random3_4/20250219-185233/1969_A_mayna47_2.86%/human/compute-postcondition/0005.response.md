Postcondition: **The function definition `def func_1(t, test_cases):` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 2. The variable `v` is now a list of length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user. The values of `t` and `test_cases` are not affected.**
