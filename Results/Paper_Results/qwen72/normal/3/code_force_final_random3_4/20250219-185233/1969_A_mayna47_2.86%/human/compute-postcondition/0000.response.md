Output State: **The function definition `def func_1(t, test_cases):` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t` and `test_cases` are not affected.**

In natural language: The function definition is still `def func_1(t, test_cases):`, and the variable `n` is now an integer value provided by the user. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain as they were initially.
