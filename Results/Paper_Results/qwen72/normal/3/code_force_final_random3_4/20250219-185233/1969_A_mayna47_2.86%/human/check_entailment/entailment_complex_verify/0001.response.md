### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function correctly initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros and then reads the list of best friends, appending it to `v` starting from index 1. This ensures `v` is 1-indexed, matching the problem's input format.

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 2` by printing `2`. This is because both friends must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

4. **General Case**:
   - The program iterates through each friend from 1 to `n`.
   - For each friend `i`, it checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is true if the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself, indicating a cycle of length 3.
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints `2` and returns, indicating that inviting 2 friends from this cycle will ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.
   - If no such cycle is found, the program prints `3`, indicating that the minimum number of invitations required is 3.

### Analysis:
- **Cycle Detection**:
  - The condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is used to detect cycles of length 3. However, this condition is not sufficient to cover all cases where at least 2 friends can be invited.
  - For example, if the best friend relationships form a cycle of length 2 (i.e., `v[v[i]] == i`), then inviting just 2 friends from this cycle will ensure both attend the party. The program does not check for cycles of length 2.
  - Additionally, the program does not consider other configurations that might allow inviting fewer than 3 friends, such as chains of friends where each friend's best friend is the next friend in the chain.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 2` by printing `2`.
  - For `n > 2`, the program only checks for cycles of length 3 and prints `3` if no such cycle is found. This is incorrect because there could be cycles of length 2 or other configurations that allow inviting fewer than 3 friends.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only checks for cycles of length 3 and does not handle cycles of length 2 or other configurations that might allow inviting fewer than 3 friends.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
