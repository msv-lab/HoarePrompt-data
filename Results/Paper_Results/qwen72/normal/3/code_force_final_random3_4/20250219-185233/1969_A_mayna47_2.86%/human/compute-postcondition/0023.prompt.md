You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be defined to accept input parameters for the number of test cases t, the number of friends n for each test case, and the list of best friends p for each test case. However, the provided function definition `def func_1():` does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of integers (1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct).
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n`, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` at any iteration, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program completes the loop and returns nothing.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: *The function definition `def func_1(t, test_cases):` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is an input integer. The variable `v` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user. The values of `t` and `test_cases` are not affected. If `n` is 2, the program does not modify `v` and returns nothing. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is set to `n`, and the program iterates from `i` down to 0. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` at any iteration, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program completes the loop and returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters: `t`, an integer where 1 <= t <= 5000, representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of integers (1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct). However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, and the function returns nothing in all cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.

Case_3: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
