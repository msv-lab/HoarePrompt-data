The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Given that `n` is not equal to 2, we need to ensure that `n` is either less than 2 or greater than 2 to allow the loop to execute. However, since `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n`, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged**
