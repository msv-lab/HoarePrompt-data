Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases `t` and the test cases themselves. However, the function is called in a loop for each test case, which is a common pattern in competitive programming for handling multiple test cases. Despite this, the function should be defined to accept the necessary inputs.

2. **Handling the Number of Friends `n`**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
   - The list `v` is initialized with an extra 0 at the beginning to make the indices 1-based, which is appropriate given the problem constraints.

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`**:
   - If `n` is 2, the function correctly prints 2 and returns. This is because if there are only 2 friends, and they are each other's best friends, Monocarp needs to invite both to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **General Case for `n > 2`**:
   - The function iterates through the list `v` to check if `v[v[v[i]]] == i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. This condition checks if there is a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships.
   - If such a cycle is found, the function prints 2 and returns. This is because if there is a cycle of length 3, inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - If no such cycle is found, the function prints 3 and returns. This is because if there are no cycles of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3 (for example, inviting three friends in a chain where each friend's best friend is the next friend in the chain).

5. **Edge Cases and General Validity**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 2.
   - For `n > 2`, the function checks for cycles of length 3, which is a valid approach to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - However, the function does not handle other potential cycles or structures in the best friend relationships, which could lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

6. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function does not handle the input for multiple test cases correctly. It should be defined to accept and process multiple test cases, but it currently only processes one test case per call.
   - The function does not return any value, which is fine for this problem since the output is printed directly.

Given the above reasoning, the function is **incorrect** because it does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description. Additionally, it does not correctly handle all possible best friend relationships, which could lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
