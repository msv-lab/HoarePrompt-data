Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user.
- The element at the index `v[v[i]]` in the list `v` is equal to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `v`**:
   - The list `v` has a length of `n + 1`.
   - The first element of `v` is 0.
   - The remaining elements are integers provided by the user.
   - The element at the index `v[v[i]]` is 1.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Element at `v[v[i]]`**:
   - `v[i]` is the element at index 1 of the list `v`.
   - Let's denote `v[1]` as `x`.
   - According to the precondition, `v[v[1]]` (which is `v[x]`) must be 1.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet `print(2)` simply prints the integer 2.

### Conclusion:
The `print(2)` statement will print the integer 2, regardless of the values of `n`, `i`, `v`, `t`, or `test_cases`.

Output: **2**
