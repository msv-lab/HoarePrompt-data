Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. However, the function `func_1` is called without any parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should be defined to accept the necessary parameters for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is a mistake. It should accept the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p` as parameters.

3. **Initialization**: The function initializes a list `v` of length `n + 1` with zeros and then replaces the first element with 0 and the rest with the input values. This is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

4. **Special Case for n = 2**: The function correctly handles the special case where `n` is 2 by printing 2 and returning. This is correct because if there are only 2 friends, both must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

5. **Main Logic**: The function checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. If this condition is met, it prints 2 and returns. This condition is intended to check if there is a cycle of length 3 or more where inviting any one friend in the cycle will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly identify all possible cycles or pairs of friends that can be invited.

6. **Default Case**: If the loop completes without finding such a cycle, the function prints 3. This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible scenarios where fewer than 3 invitations might be sufficient to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

7. **Missing Test Case Handling**: The function does not handle multiple test cases properly. It should be called for each test case with the appropriate parameters.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect. The function should be defined to accept the necessary parameters, and the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations should be more robust to handle all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
