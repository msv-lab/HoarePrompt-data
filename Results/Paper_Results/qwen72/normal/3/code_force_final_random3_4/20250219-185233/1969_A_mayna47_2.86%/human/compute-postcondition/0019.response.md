Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n`, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` at any iteration, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program completes the loop and returns nothing.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop will have completed all its iterations, with `i` reaching the value of `n`.
- The list `v` will still have a length of `n + 1`, with the first element being 0 and the remaining elements being the integers provided by the user.
- The variables `t` and `test_cases` will remain unchanged from their initial state.
- If at any point during the loop, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is met, the program will print 2 and return immediately, terminating the loop.
- If the condition is never met, the loop will complete all iterations and the program will return nothing.
