You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be defined to accept input parameters for the number of test cases t, the number of friends n for each test case, and the list of best friends p for each test case. However, the provided function definition `def func_1():` does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `p` of integers (1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct).
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n`, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` at any iteration, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program completes the loop and returns nothing.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: *The function definition `def func_1(t, test_cases):` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is an input integer. The variable `v` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user. The values of `t` and `test_cases` are not affected. If `n` is 2, the program does not modify `v` and returns nothing. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is set to `n`, and the program iterates from `i` down to 0. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` at any iteration, the program prints 2 and returns. Otherwise, the program completes the loop and returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user input and a list of integers `v` of length `n`. It then checks if `n` is 2, in which case it prints 2 and returns. If `n` is greater than 2, it iterates through the list `v` and checks if `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. If this condition is met at any point, it prints 2 and returns. If the condition is never met, it prints 3 and returns. The function does not modify any external variables or parameters and always returns nothing.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads the number of friends `n`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1. This is done to make the list 1-indexed, which matches the problem's input format.

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`**:
   - If there are only 2 friends, the program directly prints `2` because both friends must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

4. **General Case**:
   - The program iterates through each friend from 1 to `n`.
   - For each friend `i`, it checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is true if the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself. This indicates a cycle of length 3.
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints `2` and returns, indicating that inviting 2 friends from this cycle will ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.
   - If no such cycle is found, the program prints `3`, indicating that the minimum number of invitations required is 3.

### Analysis:
- **Cycle Detection**:
  - The condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is used to detect cycles of length 3. However, this condition is not sufficient to cover all cases where at least 2 friends can be invited.
  - For example, if the best friend relationships form a cycle of length 2 (i.e., `v[v[i]] == i`), then inviting just 2 friends from this cycle will ensure both attend the party. The program does not check for cycles of length 2.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 2` by printing `2`.
  - For `n > 2`, the program only checks for cycles of length 3 and prints `3` if no such cycle is found. This is incorrect because there could be cycles of length 2, or other configurations that allow inviting fewer than 3 friends.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only checks for cycles of length 3 and does not handle cycles of length 2 or other configurations that might allow inviting fewer than 3 friends.

### Correctness:
**False**
