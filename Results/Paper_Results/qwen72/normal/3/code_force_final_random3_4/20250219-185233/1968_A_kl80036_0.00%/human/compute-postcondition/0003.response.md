Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(y)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `y` is calculated as the integer result of `x` divided by 2. This means `y` will be the floor division of `x` by 2, which is `x // 2`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `y`, which is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.

Output: **y (where y is the integer result of x divided by 2)**
