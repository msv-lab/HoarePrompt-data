### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) is the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \) (integer division by 2).
   - Finally, it prints \( y \).

3. **Evaluating the Choice of \( y = x // 2 \):**
   - The choice \( y = x // 2 \) is a heuristic that often results in a large \( y \) and a non-trivial \( \gcd(x, y) \).
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is exactly half of \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be \( y \) itself, which is \( x // 2 \). Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = x \).
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is approximately half of \( x \). The \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be 1, and \( y \) itself will be large. Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + y \).

4. **Checking the Output for Given Examples:**
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \). \( \gcd(10, 5) = 5 \), so \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 7 // 2 = 3 \). \( \gcd(7, 3) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 21 // 2 = 10 \). \( \gcd(21, 10) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 11 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 100 // 2 = 50 \). \( \gcd(100, 50) = 50 \), so \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 2 // 2 = 1 \). \( \gcd(2, 1) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 1000 // 2 = 500 \). \( \gcd(1000, 500) = 500 \), so \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 6 // 2 = 3 \). \( \gcd(6, 3) = 3 \), so \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6 \).

5. **General Correctness:**
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest possible \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \), and the \( \gcd \) is \( y \) itself, which maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is approximately half of \( x \), and the \( \gcd \) is 1, which still maximizes \( y \).

6. **Challenging the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment is correct in stating that \( y = x // 2 \) is a good heuristic for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - However, it is important to note that for odd \( x \), the \( \gcd \) is always 1, and \( y \) is the largest possible integer less than \( x \) that is approximately half of \( x \). This is the best possible \( y \) for odd \( x \) in terms of maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is indeed the largest possible \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \), and the \( \gcd \) is \( y \) itself, which maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description and constraints. It consistently provides a valid \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given range of \( x \).
