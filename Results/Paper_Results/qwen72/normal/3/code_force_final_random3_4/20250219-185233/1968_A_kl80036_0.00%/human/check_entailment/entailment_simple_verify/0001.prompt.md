You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with an integer `x` where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, the function should find an integer `y` (1 ≤ y < x) that maximizes the value of gcd(x, y) + y.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) is the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \) (integer division by 2).
   - Finally, it prints \( y \).

3. **Evaluating the Choice of \( y = x // 2 \):**
   - The choice \( y = x // 2 \) is a common heuristic because it often results in a large \( y \) and a non-trivial \( \gcd(x, y) \).
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is exactly half of \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be \( y \) itself, which is \( x // 2 \).
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is approximately half of \( x \). The \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be 1, and \( y \) itself will be large.

4. **Checking the Output for Given Examples:**
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 10 // 2 = 5 \). \( \gcd(10, 5) = 5 \), so \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 7 // 2 = 3 \). \( \gcd(7, 3) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 21 // 2 = 10 \). \( \gcd(21, 10) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 11 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 100 // 2 = 50 \). \( \gcd(100, 50) = 50 \), so \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 2 // 2 = 1 \). \( \gcd(2, 1) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 1000 // 2 = 500 \). \( \gcd(1000, 500) = 500 \), so \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 6 // 2 = 3 \). \( \gcd(6, 3) = 3 \), so \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6 \).

5. **General Correctness:**
   - The choice \( y = x // 2 \) often provides a large \( y \) and a non-trivial \( \gcd(x, y) \), which helps in maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest possible \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \), and the \( \gcd \) is \( y \) itself.
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is approximately half of \( x \), and the \( \gcd \) is 1, which still maximizes \( y \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description and constraints. It consistently provides a valid \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given range of \( x \).

Correctness: **True**
