Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with an integer `x` where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, the function should find an integer `y` (1 ≤ y < x) that maximizes the value of gcd(x, y) + y.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is the integer result of `x` divided by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and calculates `y` as `x // 2`. The function then prints `y` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program includes `t` being an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` being `t-1`, and `x` being the last input integer greater than 0, with `y` being the integer result of `x` divided by 2.
