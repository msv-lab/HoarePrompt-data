The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the integer result of `x` divided by 2, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
