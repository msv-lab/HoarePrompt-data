- The choice \( y = x // 2 \) often provides a large \( y \) and a non-trivial \( \gcd(x, y) \), which helps in maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest possible \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \), and the \( \gcd \) is \( y \) itself.
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is approximately half of \( x \), and the \( \gcd \) is 1, which still maximizes \( y \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description and constraints. It consistently provides a valid \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given range of \( x \).
