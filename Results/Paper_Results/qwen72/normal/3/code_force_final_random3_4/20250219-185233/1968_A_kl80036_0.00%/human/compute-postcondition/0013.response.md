The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `x` (an integer for each test case). The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. For each test case, the function finds an integer `y` (1 ≤ y < x) that maximizes the value of gcd(x, y) + y. The function returns the maximum value of gcd(x, y) + y for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `x`. `t` is the number of test cases, an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000. The function returns the maximum value of gcd(x, y) + y for each test case, where `y` is an integer between 1 and `x-1`.**
