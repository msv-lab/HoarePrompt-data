The function `func` is expected to be called with an integer `x` where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, the function should find an integer `y` (1 ≤ y < x) that maximizes the value of gcd(x, y) + y.
