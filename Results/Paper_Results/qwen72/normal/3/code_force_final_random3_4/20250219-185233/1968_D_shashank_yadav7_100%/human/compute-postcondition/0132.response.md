The value of `sp` is incremented by `a[s]`. The initial value of `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, so after the execution, `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]` which simplifies to `3 * a[s]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than `n`, `k` is the new value of `k` from input minus 2, `b` is the new value of `p[b]` minus 1, `s` is the new value of `p[s]` minus 1, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is equal to `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is the new value of `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
