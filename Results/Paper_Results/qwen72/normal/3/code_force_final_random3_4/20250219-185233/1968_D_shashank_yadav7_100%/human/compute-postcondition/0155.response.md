The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts:
  - `n`: an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the permutation.
  - `k`: an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the duration of the game.
  - `P_B`: an integer where 1 ≤ P_B ≤ n, representing the starting position of Bodya.
  - `P_S`: an integer where 1 ≤ P_S ≤ n, representing the starting position of Sasha.
  - `p`: a permutation of length n, containing integers from 1 to n.
  - `a`: an array of length n, containing integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns the results for each test case. However, the specific return values are not provided in the output description. Based on the context, it is likely that the function returns some form of result or status for each test case, possibly related to the positions of Bodya and Sasha after the game duration `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one, likely related to the positions of Bodya and Sasha after the game duration `k`.**
