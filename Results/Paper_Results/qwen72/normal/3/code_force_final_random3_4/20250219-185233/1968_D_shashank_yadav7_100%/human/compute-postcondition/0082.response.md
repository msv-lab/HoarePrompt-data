Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -2 or decreased by 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` twice.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `bp` is increased by `a[b]` once.
- The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increases `bp` by `a[b]` again.
- Therefore, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` twice in total.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
