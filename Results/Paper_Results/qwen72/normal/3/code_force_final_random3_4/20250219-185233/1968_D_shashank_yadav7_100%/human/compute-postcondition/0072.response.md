Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is -1 or decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `k` remains -1 or decreased by 1.
- `b` remains `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` remains `p[s] - 1`.
- `bm` is still the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`.
- `sm` is still the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`.
- `sp` is still increased by `a[s]`.
- `bp` is now increased by `a[b]`.
