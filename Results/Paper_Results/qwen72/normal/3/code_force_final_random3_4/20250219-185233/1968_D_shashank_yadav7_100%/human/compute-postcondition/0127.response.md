Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than `n`, `k` is the new value of `k` from input minus 2, `b` is the new value of `p[b]` minus 1, `s` is the new value of `p[s]` minus 1, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * (k + 1) + sp`, `sp` is equal to `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is the new value of `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.***
