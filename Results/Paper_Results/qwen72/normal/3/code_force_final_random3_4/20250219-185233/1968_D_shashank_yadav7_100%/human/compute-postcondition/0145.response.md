Postcondition: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the initial value of `n`, `t` is greater than `n`, `k` is the initial value of `k` minus `n`, `b` is the value of `p[b]` after `n` iterations minus `n`, `s` is the value of `p[s]` after `n` iterations minus `n`, `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n` iterations, `sp` is the sum of `n` times `a[s]`, `bp` is the sum of `n` times `a[b]`, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `bm` is greater than `sm`. If `k` reaches 0 before `n` iterations, the loop breaks early.**
