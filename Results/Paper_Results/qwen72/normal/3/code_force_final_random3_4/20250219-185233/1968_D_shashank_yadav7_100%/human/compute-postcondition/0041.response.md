The value of `bp` is incremented by `a[b]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer minus 3, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[p[b] - 1] + a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**
