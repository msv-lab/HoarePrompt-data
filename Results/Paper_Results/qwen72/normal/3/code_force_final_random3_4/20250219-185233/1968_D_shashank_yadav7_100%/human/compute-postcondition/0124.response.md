The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than `n`, `k` is the new value of `k` from input minus 1, `b` is the new value of `p[b]` minus 1, `s` is the new value of `p[s]` minus 1, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is equal to `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is the new value of `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, and `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
