### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, as well as the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**: The function initializes the positions of Bodya and Sasha by decrementing `P_B` and `P_S` by 1, which is correct because the positions are 1-indexed in the problem statement but Python lists are 0-indexed.

3. **Score Calculation**: The function calculates the initial scores for Bodya and Sasha (`bp` and `sp`) by adding the value of `a` at their starting positions. It then iterates `k` times to simulate the game, updating the positions and scores accordingly.

4. **Movement Simulation**: The function updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p` and calculates the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) by considering the current score and the potential future scores based on the remaining turns.

5. **Loop Break Condition**: The loop correctly breaks when `k` reaches 0, which is appropriate for the game mechanics.

6. **Final Comparison**: After the loop, the function compares the final scores (`bm` and `sm`) and prints the result accordingly.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Break Condition**: The loop condition `k -= 1` and `if k == 0: break` is incorrect. The loop should run exactly `k` times, not decrement `k` within the loop. This can lead to incorrect scores if `k` is not properly managed.

2. **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The way the function calculates the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) is flawed. It updates `bm` and `sm` using `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`, which does not accurately reflect the game rules. The correct approach should be to sum the scores for each turn, not multiply by the remaining turns.

3. **Redundant Variables**: The variables `bm` and `sm` are not necessary for the final comparison. The scores `bp` and `sp` should be sufficient to determine the winner.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, P_B, P_S = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        P_B -= 1
        P_S -= 1
        
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        
        b = P_B
        s = P_S
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the loop and score calculation.
- The corrected version accurately simulates the game and correctly determines the winner.

Correctness: **False**
