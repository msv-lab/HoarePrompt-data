Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer minus 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[s] + a[p[s] - 1]`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, `bm` and `sm` are both set to -1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
