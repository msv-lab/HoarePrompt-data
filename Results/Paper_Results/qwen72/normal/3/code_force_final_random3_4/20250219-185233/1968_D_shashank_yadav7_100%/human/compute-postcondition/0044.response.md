Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is `n-1` (or `n` if the loop breaks early).
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. `k` is `k - n` (or `k - i` if the loop breaks early).
5. `b` is the result of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` or `i` nested applications of `p`).
6. `s` is the result of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` or `i` nested applications of `p`).
7. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
8. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
9. `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[s] - 1` for `i` iterations.
10. `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` and the values of `a` at each index `p[b] - 1` for `i` iterations.
11. `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations.
12. `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations.
13. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are set to -1, and the loop breaks.
14. `bm` is greater than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Bodya'`.
- The initial state provides a detailed description of the variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The condition that `bm` is greater than `sm` is given, but it does not affect the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
