Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
