Output State: **`i` is `n-1` or the loop breaks when `k` reaches 0, `k` is `k - n` or `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times or until `k` reaches 0), `s` is `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where `p` is applied `n` times or until `k` reaches 0), `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each `b` and `k` during the loop, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each `s` and `k` during the loop, `sp` is increased by the sum of `a[s]` for each `s` during the loop, `bp` is increased by the sum of `a[b]` for each `b` during the loop.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop index `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes all `n` iterations, or the loop will break when `k` reaches 0.
- The value of `k` will be `k - n` if the loop completes all `n` iterations, or it will be -1 if the loop breaks early.
- The value of `b` will be the result of applying the transformation `p[b] - 1` `n` times or until `k` reaches 0.
- The value of `s` will be the result of applying the transformation `p[s] - 1` `n` times or until `k` reaches 0.
- The value of `bm` will be the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` that was computed during the loop, for each `b` and `k`.
- The value of `sm` will be the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` that was computed during the loop, for each `s` and `k`.
- The value of `sp` will be increased by the sum of `a[s]` for each `s` encountered during the loop.
- The value of `bp` will be increased by the sum of `a[b]` for each `b` encountered during the loop.
