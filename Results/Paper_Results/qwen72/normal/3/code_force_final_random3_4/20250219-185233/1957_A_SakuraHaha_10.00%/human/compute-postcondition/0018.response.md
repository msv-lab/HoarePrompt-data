To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for each value `x` in `cnt.values()`. Here, `x // 4` performs integer division, which means it returns the quotient without the remainder.

2. **Understanding `cnt` and `ans`:**
   - `cnt` is a dictionary that maps each unique integer in `a` to its frequency (count) in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is calculated by iterating over the values in `cnt` (which are the counts of the unique integers) and summing the result of `x // 4` for each count `x`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
   - The dictionary `cnt` would be:
     ```python
     cnt = {1: 4, 2: 5, 3: 6}
     ```
   - Now, calculate `ans`:
     - For `1` (count 4): `4 // 4 = 1`
     - For `2` (count 5): `5 // 4 = 1`
     - For `3` (count 6): `6 // 4 = 1`
     - Sum of these values: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
   - Therefore, `ans` would be 3.

4. **General Case:**
   - For any list `a`, `cnt` will map each unique integer to its count.
   - `ans` will be the sum of the integer division of each count by 4.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of `x // 4` for each value `x` in `cnt.values()`.
   - Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of `x // 4` for each count `x` in `cnt`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of `x // 4` for each value `x` in `cnt.values()`, and `cnt` is a dictionary mapping each unique integer in list `a` to its count)**
