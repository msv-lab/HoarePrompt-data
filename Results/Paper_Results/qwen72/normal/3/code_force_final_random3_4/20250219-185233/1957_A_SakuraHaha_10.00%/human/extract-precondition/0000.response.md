Precondition: **The function should take a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n followed by a list of n integers representing the lengths of the sticks. Each test case list should be structured as [n, [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]], with 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined to accept the list of test cases or the parameters for a single test case. Here is a corrected function definition:

```
def max_polygons(test_cases):
```

Precondition: **test_cases is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains an integer n followed by a list of n integers representing the lengths of the sticks. Each test case list is structured as [n, [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]], with 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100.**
