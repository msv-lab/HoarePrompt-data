To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:
```
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
```
This loop will execute if `n - 3` is greater than or equal to `-1`. Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop starts at `i = n - 3` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 3` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - `n - 3 >= -1`
   - Simplifying this, we get: `n >= 2`

3. **Initial State of `i`**:
   - Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `n - 3`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `cards`, and `dp` are mentioned in the state, but only `i` and `n` are relevant to the loop head.

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2 and `i` is set to `n - 3` before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0 and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0, `i` is `n - 3`**
