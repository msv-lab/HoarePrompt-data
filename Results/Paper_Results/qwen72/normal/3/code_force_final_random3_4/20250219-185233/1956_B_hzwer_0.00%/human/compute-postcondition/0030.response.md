To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

This loop iterates over `j` starting from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`. This means `n` must be at least 1. However, the problem statement specifies that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute.

The variable `j` is initialized to `n - 1` at the start of the loop. Given the state before the loop starts, `j` is already set to `0`, which is incorrect for the loop to execute properly. We need to adjust `j` to `n - 1`.

The variable `i` is also mentioned in the state, but it is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 4, `j` is n - 1**
