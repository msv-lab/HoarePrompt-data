Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 4, `j` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 4, and `j` is n - 1. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is exactly 1, `dp[n-4][n-1]` is the maximum of `dp[n-3][n-1]` and `dp[n-2][n-2] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 4, and `j` is n - 2. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 4, and `j` is n - 3. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
