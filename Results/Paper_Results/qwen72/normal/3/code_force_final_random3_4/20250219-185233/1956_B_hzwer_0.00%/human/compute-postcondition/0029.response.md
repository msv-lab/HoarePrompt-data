The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 3` down to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to have executed at least once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decreased by 1. However, since the loop is iterating in reverse, the next value of `i` should be `n - 4`. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is updated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards` for all valid `i` and `j` in the loop, `i` is n - 4, `j` is 0**
