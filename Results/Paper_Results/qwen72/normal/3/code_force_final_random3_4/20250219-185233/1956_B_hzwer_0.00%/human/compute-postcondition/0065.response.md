Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer such that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cards` is a list of integers input by the user, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1), `i` is `n - 5`, `j` is `n - 2`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the same as the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
