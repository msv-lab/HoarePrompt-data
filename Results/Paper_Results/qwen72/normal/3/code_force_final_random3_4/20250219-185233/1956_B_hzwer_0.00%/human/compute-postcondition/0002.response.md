Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the number of cards each player receives and the integers on the cards in your hand, respectively. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most 2 times in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer. `cards` is a list of integers input by the user. `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0.**
