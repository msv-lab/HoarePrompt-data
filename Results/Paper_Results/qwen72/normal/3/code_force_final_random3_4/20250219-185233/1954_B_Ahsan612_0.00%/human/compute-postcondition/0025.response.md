The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `len(ar)`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 or 5, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `len(ar)` must be greater than 4 or 5, respectively. Since `i` can be either 4 or 5, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 5 to cover both cases.

State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5, `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 or 3, and `num` is equal to the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` in `ar`. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 4 or 5, `same` is 1, and `num` is equal to the element at index `i` in `ar`.**
