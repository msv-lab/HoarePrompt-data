The only object in the loop head is the temporary variable `_` and the range defined by the input value `t`. The loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). At the end of the last iteration, the state of `_` is not explicitly known, but it is incremented by 1 for each iteration. Since the loop is based on the range of `t`, and `t` is the input value that does not change, the loop will execute one more time if `_` is less than `t`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the input value `t` remains the same, and `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`.

State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was `inf`, then `minn` is now `same`. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.**
