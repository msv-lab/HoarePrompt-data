The variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the length of `ar`. If `i` is less than the length of `ar`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Since `i` is 3, `ar` must have at least 4 elements to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least four elements, `i` is 3, if `ar[1]` is equal to `num` (which is the first element of `ar`), `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the third element of `ar`, and `minn` is 1, with the condition that the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**
