### Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `same` is initialized to 1, which will count the length of the current sequence of consecutive elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity (`inf`), which will store the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements found.

3. **Loop Through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the array using a while loop with index `i`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, it increments `same` to continue the current sequence.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, then resets `same` to 1 and updates `num` to the current element `ar[i]`.
   - The index `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last sequence.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means there were no sequences of consecutive elements, and the program prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Issues and Incorrectness:

1. **Incorrect Update of `i` and `num`:**
   - The program increments `i` by 1 after checking if `ar[i]` is different from `num`. However, it also increments `i` by 1 at the end of the loop, which can lead to skipping elements.
   - The correct approach should be to increment `i` only once, either inside the else block or at the end of the loop.

2. **Handling of Consecutive Sequences:**
   - The program updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same` when a different element is encountered. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array is entirely composed of the same element.
   - For an array like `[2, 2, 2]`, the program will incorrectly print 1 instead of -1 because it does not account for the fact that an array of identical elements cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any number of elements.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the array length `n` is 1. According to the problem, if the array has only one element, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, and the output should be -1.

### Corrected Program:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```
