Postcondition: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 or 2, `same` is 1 or 2, and `num` is equal to the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` in `ar`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `i` is 2, and `num` is updated to the element at index `i` in `ar`. Additionally, `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1.**
