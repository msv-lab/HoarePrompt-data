Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1.**

The variable `i` is assigned the value 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10,000, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`, and `minn` is infinity. After the code execution, all these conditions still hold true.
