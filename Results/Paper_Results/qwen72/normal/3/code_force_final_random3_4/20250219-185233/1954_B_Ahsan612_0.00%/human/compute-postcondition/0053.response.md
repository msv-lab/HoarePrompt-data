Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `num` is equal to the element at index `i` of `ar`, `i` is 2, and the element at index `i` of `ar` is not equal to the previous value of `num`.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (`inf`) and the value of `same` (which is 1).
- Since `inf` is greater than 1, `minn` is now 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
