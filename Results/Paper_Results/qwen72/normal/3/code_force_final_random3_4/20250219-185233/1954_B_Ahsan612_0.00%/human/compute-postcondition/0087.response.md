The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the condition for the loop to execute is `i < len(ar)`. Given that `i` is 1 right before the loop, the loop will execute if `len(ar)` is greater than 1. Since `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, we can assume that `ar` has at least one element (as `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`). However, for the loop to execute, `ar` must have at least two elements.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least two elements, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `i` is 1**
