To determine what will be printed by the `print(minn)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **_**: This variable is mentioned as being incremented by the number of iterations, but it is not directly relevant to the `print(minn)` statement.
2. **t**: A positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). This is also not directly relevant to the `print(minn)` statement.
3. **n**: An input integer. This is the length of the list `ar`.
4. **ar**: A list of integers input by the user. The exact values of the integers in `ar` are not specified, but we know it is a list of integers.
5. **i**: Equal to the length of `ar`. Therefore, `i = n`.
6. **num**: The last element of `ar`. This is the last integer in the list `ar`.
7. **minn**: The minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in `ar`.
8. **same**: The length of the last sequence of consecutive same numbers in `ar`.

Given that `minn` is the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in `ar`, and `minn` is not equal to infinity, we can infer that there is at least one sequence of consecutive same numbers in the list `ar`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
- **ar** is a list of integers.
- **minn** is calculated by finding the lengths of all consecutive sequences of the same number in `ar` and then taking the minimum of these lengths.
- Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it means there is at least one sequence of consecutive same numbers in `ar`.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `ar = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the lengths of consecutive sequences are:
  - 1, 1: length 2
  - 2, 2, 2: length 3
  - 3, 3, 3, 3: length 4
  - Therefore, `minn` would be 2.
- If `ar = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, the lengths of consecutive sequences are:
  - 1: length 1
  - 2, 2: length 2
  - 3, 3, 3: length 3
  - 4, 4, 4, 4: length 4
  - Therefore, `minn` would be 1.

### Conclusion:
The `print(minn)` statement will print the minimum length of any consecutive sequence of the same number in the list `ar`. Since the exact values of `ar` are not provided, we can only describe `minn` in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum length of any consecutive sequence of the same number in the list `ar`)**
