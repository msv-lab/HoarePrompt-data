Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the program maintains the initial state. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-1)}\) if `power` is equal to `n`, or greater than \(2^{(power-2)}\) if `power` is not equal to `n`. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1\). If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is updated to \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\).***
