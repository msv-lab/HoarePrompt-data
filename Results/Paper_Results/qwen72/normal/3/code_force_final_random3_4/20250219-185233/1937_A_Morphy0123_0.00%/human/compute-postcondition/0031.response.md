Output State: **`i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 2^(power-1), `power` is the smallest integer such that 2^power >= n.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `i` remains 1 because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n_cases` remains greater than 1 because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` must be greater than 2^(power-1) to ensure the loop executes at least `power` times.
- The variable `power` is incremented in each iteration of the loop until it reaches the smallest integer such that 2^power is greater than or equal to `n`. This means that after the loop finishes, `power` will be the smallest integer for which 2^power is at least as large as `n`.
