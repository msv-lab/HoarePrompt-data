The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n_cases`. If `i` is less than `n_cases`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n_cases` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2, and `n_cases` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the program maintains the initial state. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than 2^(power-1). If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains the smallest integer such that 2^power >= n. If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is one less than the smallest integer such that 2^power >= n.**
