Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 and `n` is odd, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 30, and `_` is 0. If 2 * a < b, the condition 2 * a < b holds. Otherwise, the condition 2 * a >= b holds.**
