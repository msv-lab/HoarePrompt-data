Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 30\).
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 30\).
- `_` is 1.

### Update Conditions:
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input.
- If `n` is odd:
  - If \(2 * a < b\), the condition \(2 * a < b\) holds.
  - Otherwise, the condition \(2 * a \geq b\) holds.
- If `n` is even:
  - If \(2 * a < b\), the current value of \(2 * a\) is less than the current value of `b`.
  - Otherwise, \(2 * a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(a * n)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Values of `n`, `a`, and `b`**:
   - These values are provided by the input and are within the specified ranges.
   - The exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not given, but we know they are integers within their respective ranges.

2. **Condition Based on `n`**:
   - If `n` is odd, the condition \(2 * a < b\) or \(2 * a \geq b\) is checked, but this does not affect the value of `a` or `n`.
   - If `n` is even, the condition \(2 * a < b\) or \(2 * a \geq b\) is checked, but this does not affect the value of `a` or `n`.

3. **Output of `print(a * n)`**:
   - The code snippet simply multiplies `a` by `n` and prints the result.
   - Since the values of `a` and `n` are provided by the input and are within the specified ranges, the output will be the product of `a` and `n`.

### Final Output:
The code prints the product of `a` and `n`, where `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
Output: **a * n (where a is an integer between 1 and 30, and n is an integer between 1 and 100)**
