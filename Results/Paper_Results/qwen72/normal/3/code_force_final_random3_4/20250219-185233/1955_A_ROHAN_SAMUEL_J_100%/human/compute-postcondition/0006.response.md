Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and `n` is odd.
   - `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 30\).
   - `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 30\).
   - `_` is 0.
   - \(2 \times a \geq b\).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(n // 2 * b + a)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is odd, `n // 2` will always be \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\).
   - `n // 2 * b` multiplies the result of the integer division by `b`.
   - `n // 2 * b + a` adds `a` to the result of the multiplication.

4. **Calculation:**
   - Let's denote \( k = \frac{n - 1}{2} \). Since `n` is odd, \( k \) is an integer.
   - The expression `n // 2 * b + a` becomes \( k \times b + a \).
   - Therefore, the output will be \( \frac{n - 1}{2} \times b + a \).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact numerical value depends on the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - However, based on the given conditions, the output will be the result of the expression \( \frac{n - 1}{2} \times b + a \).

Output: **\(\frac{n - 1}{2} \times b + a\) (where \( n \) is an odd integer between 1 and 100, \( a \) is an integer between 1 and 30, and \( b \) is an integer between 1 and 30 such that \( 2 \times a \geq b \))**
