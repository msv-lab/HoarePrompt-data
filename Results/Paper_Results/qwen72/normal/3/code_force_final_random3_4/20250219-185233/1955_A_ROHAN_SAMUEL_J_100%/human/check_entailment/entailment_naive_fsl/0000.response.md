Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than twice the regular price `a`, but the number of yogurts `n` is odd. In such a case, the program incorrectly adds the price of one yogurt at the regular price `a` after buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price. This can lead to a higher total cost than necessary.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 5 8
```
- The program will calculate the cost as follows:
  - `n` is odd, so it will buy one yogurt at the regular price `a` and the remaining two yogurts at the promotion price `b`.
  - The total cost will be `1 * 5 + 1 * 8 = 13`.

However, the correct minimum cost should be:
- Buy one yogurt at the regular price `a` and the remaining two yogurts at the promotion price `b`.
- The total cost should be `1 * 5 + 1 * 8 = 13`.

But if we consider another example:
```
1
3 5 7
```
- The program will calculate the cost as follows:
  - `n` is odd, so it will buy one yogurt at the regular price `a` and the remaining two yogurts at the promotion price `b`.
  - The total cost will be `1 * 5 + 1 * 7 = 12`.

However, the correct minimum cost should be:
- Buy all three yogurts at the regular price `a` because `2 * a < b` is not true.
- The total cost should be `3 * 5 = 15`.

The program incorrectly adds the price of one yogurt at the regular price `a` after buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price, which can lead to a higher total cost than necessary.
