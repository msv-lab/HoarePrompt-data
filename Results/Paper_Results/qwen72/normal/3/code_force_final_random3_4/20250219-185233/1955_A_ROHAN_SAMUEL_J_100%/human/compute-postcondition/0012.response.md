Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and `n` is even.
   - `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 30\).
   - `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 30\).
   - `_` is 0.
   - \(2 \times a \geq b\).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(n // 2 * b)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will always be an integer.
   - The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.
   - The final value to be printed is the product of `n // 2` and `b`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Given that `n` is even and within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `n // 2` will be an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive).
   - `b` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive).
   - Therefore, the value of `n // 2 * b` will be an integer between 0 and 1500 (inclusive).

Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given ranges and conditions.

Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n is an even integer between 1 and 100, and b is an integer between 1 and 30)**
