### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price, which is `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price, which is `n // 2 * b`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly. If `n` is 1, it will always be cheaper to buy one yogurt at the regular price `a`.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is 2 correctly. If `n` is 2, it will compare the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) with the promotion price (`b`).

5. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is correct. It ensures that Maxim buys the yogurts in the most cost-effective way by comparing the regular price and the promotion price for pairs of yogurts and handling the odd case by adding the cost of one additional yogurt.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
