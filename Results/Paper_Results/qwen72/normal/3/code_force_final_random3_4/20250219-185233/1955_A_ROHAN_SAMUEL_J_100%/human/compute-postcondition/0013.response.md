Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 and `n` is even, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 30, `_` is 0. If 2 * a < b, the current value of `2 * a` is less than the current value of `b`. Otherwise, 2 * a is greater than or equal to b.***
