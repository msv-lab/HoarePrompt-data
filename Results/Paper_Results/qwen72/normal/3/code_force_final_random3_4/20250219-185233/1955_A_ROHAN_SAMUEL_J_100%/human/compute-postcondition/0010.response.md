Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and `n` is even.
- `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 30\).
- `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 30\).
- `_` is 0.
- The current value of `2 * a` is less than the current value of `b`.

The `print(a * n)` statement will print the product of `a` and `n`.

Given the constraints:
- `a` is an integer between 1 and 30.
- `n` is an even integer between 1 and 100.

The exact values of `a` and `n` are not specified, but we know that `a * n` will be an integer because both `a` and `n` are integers. Since `n` is even, the product `a * n` will also be even.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **a * n (where a is an integer between 1 and 30, and n is an even integer between 1 and 100)**
