Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by determining the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given the price for one yogurt (`a`) and the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`). The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.
2. **Odd and Even Cases**:
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotional price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
     - Otherwise, it prints the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and one additional yogurt at the regular price (`n // 2 * b + a`).
   - If `n` is even, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than the promotional price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
     - Otherwise, it prints the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price (`n // 2 * b`).

This logic ensures that the program always chooses the cheaper option between buying yogurts at the regular price or the promotional price, and it correctly handles both odd and even values of `n`.

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 9`.
  - The program prints `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - The program prints `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program prints `a * n = 3 * 5 = 15`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program prints `a * n = 4 * 5 = 20`, which is correct.

All test cases in the example are handled correctly by the program.

Correctness: **True**
