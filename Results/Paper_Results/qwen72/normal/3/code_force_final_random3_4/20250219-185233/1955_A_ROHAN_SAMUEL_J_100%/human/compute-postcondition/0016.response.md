Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 30, and `_` is 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the input. If `n` is odd, then if 2 * a < b, the condition 2 * a < b holds; otherwise, the condition 2 * a >= b holds. If `n` is even, then if 2 * a < b, the current value of 2 * a is less than the current value of b; otherwise, 2 * a is greater than or equal to b.**
