Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The program processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it correctly determines the minimum cost based on the following logic:

1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 1`)**:
   - If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price (`n // 2 * b`) and then buy one additional yogurt at the regular price (`a`), resulting in a total cost of `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`)**:
   - If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price (`n // 2 * b`).

The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and applies the appropriate logic to determine the minimum cost. The conditions and calculations are consistent with the problem description and the provided example.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
