The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list that combines two lists: `output1` and `output2`. `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, and `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x` in descending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) and returns a list that combines two lists: the first list contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, and the second list contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x` in descending order.**
