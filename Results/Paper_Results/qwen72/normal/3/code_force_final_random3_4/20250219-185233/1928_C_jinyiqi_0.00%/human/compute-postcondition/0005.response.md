Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `output1` is a list containing [1], `output2` is a list containing [x].**

The value of `x` is still an integer within the range 1 to 10^9, and `i` remains 1. The list `output1` is unchanged and still contains [1]. The list `output2` now contains the integer value of `x` because `x` is divisible by `i` (which is 1), and the result of `x / i` is appended to `output2` as an integer.
