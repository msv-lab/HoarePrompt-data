### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where the numbers from 1 to k are assigned to the first k positions, followed by the numbers from k-1 to 2 for the next k-2 positions, and this pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.
   - Vasya is given his position `n` and the number `x` he received. We need to determine how many different values of `k` fit this pattern.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - For a given `k`, the pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.
   - If Vasya's position `n` is within the first k positions, the number he receives is `x = n`.
   - If Vasya's position `n` is within the next k-2 positions, the number he receives is `x = k - (n - k) + 1 = 2k - n + 1`.

3. **Equations:**
   - From the first part of the pattern: \( n = x \)
   - From the second part of the pattern: \( n = 2k - x + 1 \)

4. **Solving for `k`:**
   - For the first equation: \( n = x \) implies \( k \geq x \).
   - For the second equation: \( n = 2k - x + 1 \) implies \( 2k = n + x - 1 \) or \( k = \frac{n + x - 1}{2} \). This `k` must be an integer and \( k \geq x \).

5. **Checking Validity:**
   - We need to check both equations for valid `k` values.
   - The function `func_1(x)` is used to find all divisors of `x`, which are then used to check if they fit the pattern.

6. **Function `func_1(x)`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
   - It is used to find potential `k` values by checking if \( k = \frac{n + x - 2}{2} \) and \( k = \frac{n - x}{2} \) are valid.

7. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.
   - It checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - It calls `func_1` to find divisors and checks if they fit the pattern.
   - It collects all valid `k` values in a list `output` and removes duplicates.

8. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find divisors.
   - The logic for checking if `k` fits the pattern is correct, but it could be more efficient.
   - The program does not handle the case where `k = 1` (which is not allowed) explicitly, but the pattern ensures that `k > 1`.
   - The program correctly identifies valid `k` values by ensuring \( k \geq x \) and that `k` is an integer.

9. **Efficiency:**
   - The program could be optimized by directly calculating the potential `k` values without finding all divisors, but the current approach is correct and works within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program is logically correct and follows the problem constraints. It correctly identifies the valid `k` values for each test case.

Final: **True**
