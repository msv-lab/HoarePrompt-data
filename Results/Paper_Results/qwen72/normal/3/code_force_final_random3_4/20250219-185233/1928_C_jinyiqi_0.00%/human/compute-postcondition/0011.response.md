The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `x` must still be an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` is a list containing [1, 2, 3], and `output2` is a list containing [x, int(x / 2), int(x / 3)]. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
