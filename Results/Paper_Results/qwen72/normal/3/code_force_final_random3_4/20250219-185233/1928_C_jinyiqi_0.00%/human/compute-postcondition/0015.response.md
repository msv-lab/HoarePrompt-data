Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list of all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` is a list of the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, in descending order.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, which means it checks all integers from 1 up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
- For each `i`, if `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), then `i` is appended to `output1` and `x // i` is appended to `output2`.
- After the loop completes, `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
- `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, in descending order, because `x // i` decreases as `i` increases.
