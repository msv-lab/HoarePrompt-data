Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `e` is 0 (though `e` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `i` is `l - 1` (though `i` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `x` is the maximum value in `nums`.
   - `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x - y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will output the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) in the list `nums`.
   - Since `x` is the maximum value and `y` is the minimum value, the output will be a non-negative integer representing the range of the values in the list `nums`.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
