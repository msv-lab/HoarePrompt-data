Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0. If `nums[i]` > 0, `x` is set to the value of `nums[0]` and `y` remains 100000000. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their initial values of 0 and 100000000, respectively.***
