Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The beauty of the array can be maximized by sorting the array in ascending or descending order. When the array is sorted, the sum of the differences between consecutive elements is maximized because the largest and smallest differences are distributed throughout the array.

However, the provided program does not sort the array. Instead, it finds the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values in the array and prints the difference `x - y`. This approach does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the example array `[1, 2, 3]`. The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array, which is already sorted, and the beauty is `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`. The program, however, would compute `3 - 1 = 2`, which coincidentally gives the correct result but does not follow the correct logic.

For another example, consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. The maximum beauty is achieved by sorting the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the beauty is `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`. The program, however, would compute `100 - 43 = 57`, which again coincidentally gives the correct result but does not follow the correct logic.

In general, the program's approach of finding the maximum and minimum values and computing their difference is not equivalent to the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
