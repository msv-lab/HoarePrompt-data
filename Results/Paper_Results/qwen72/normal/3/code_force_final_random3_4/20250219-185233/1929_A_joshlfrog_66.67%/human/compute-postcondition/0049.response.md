The only variables in the loop head are `e` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `e` and `t`. If `e` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `e` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `e` is increased by 1, so `e` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.**
