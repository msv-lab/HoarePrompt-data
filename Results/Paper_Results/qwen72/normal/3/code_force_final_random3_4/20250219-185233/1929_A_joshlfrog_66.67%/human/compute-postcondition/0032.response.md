Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is equal to `nums[0]`, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than 0.**

The value of `x` is now equal to the first element of the list `nums`, which is greater than 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
