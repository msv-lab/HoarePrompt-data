Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `nums[2]` is less than `y`, `y` is updated to `nums[2]`, and `x` is the greater of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` if both are greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.***
