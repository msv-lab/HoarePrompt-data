Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is equal to `nums[1]`, `i` is 1, `y` is updated to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is less than 100000000, otherwise `y` remains 100000000.**

Explanation:
- `x` is updated to the value of `nums[1]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the specific condition affecting `y` based on `nums[0]`.
