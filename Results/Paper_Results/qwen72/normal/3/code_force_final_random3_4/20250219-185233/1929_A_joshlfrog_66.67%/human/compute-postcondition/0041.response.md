Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `x` is 0 or `x` is equal to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than 0, and if `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, `x` is updated to `nums[1]`. If `nums[i]` (which is `nums[1]`) is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[1]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000 if `nums[0]` was less than 100000000, or `y` remains `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` was greater than or equal to 100000000.***
