Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `e` is `t-1`, `l` is the last input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `nums` is the last list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the maximum value in the last `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the last `nums`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0, indicating that there were test cases to process.
- The variable `e` is equal to `t-1`, meaning the loop has completed all `t` iterations.
- The variable `l` holds the length of the array for the last test case.
- The variable `i` is `l-1`, indicating that the inner loop has processed all elements of the last array.
- The variable `nums` contains the list of integers for the last test case.
- The variable `x` holds the maximum value found in the last `nums`.
- The variable `y` holds the minimum value found in the last `nums`.
