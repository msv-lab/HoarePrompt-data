Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this beauty, Sasha should sort the array in descending order. This way, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be maximized, leading to the highest possible sum.

However, the provided program only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference. This approach does not consider the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array, which is the actual goal of the problem.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. For each test case, read the length of the array and the array itself.
2. Sort the array in descending order.
3. Calculate the beauty of the array as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
4. Print the result for each test case.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program will correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.
