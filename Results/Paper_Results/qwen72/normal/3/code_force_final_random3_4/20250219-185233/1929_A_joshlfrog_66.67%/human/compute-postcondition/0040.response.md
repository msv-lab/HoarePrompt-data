Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 1, `x` is 0 or `x` is equal to `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than 0 and `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, `y` is updated to `nums[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `nums[1]`.
- The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
