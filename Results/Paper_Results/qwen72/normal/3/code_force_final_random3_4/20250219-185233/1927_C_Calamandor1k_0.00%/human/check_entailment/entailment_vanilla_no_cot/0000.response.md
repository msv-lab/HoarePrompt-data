Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how the program counts the elements that are less than or equal to `k` in both arrays `a` and `b`. The program iterates through the arrays and increments `count_a` and `count_b` for elements that are less than or equal to `k`, but it does not ensure that the chosen elements from both arrays collectively include every integer from 1 to `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program that checks if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each array such that every integer from 1 to `k` is included:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Create sets of elements from a and b that are <= k
        set_a = set(x for x in a if 1 <= x <= k)
        set_b = set(x for x in b if 1 <= x <= k)
        
        # Create a set of all required elements from 1 to k
        required_elements = set(range(1, k + 1))
        
        # Check if the union of set_a and set_b contains all required elements
        if set_a.union(set_b) == required_elements:
            # Check if we can choose k/2 elements from each set
            if len(set_a) >= k // 2 and len(set_b) >= k // 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Set Creation**: We create sets `set_a` and `set_b` containing elements from arrays `a` and `b` that are within the range 1 to `k`.
2. **Required Elements**: We create a set `required_elements` containing all integers from 1 to `k`.
3. **Union Check**: We check if the union of `set_a` and `set_b` contains all elements in `required_elements`.
4. **Count Check**: We then check if both `set_a` and `set_b` have at least \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements. If both conditions are met, we print "YES"; otherwise, we print "NO".

This approach ensures that the chosen elements from both arrays collectively include every integer from 1 to `k`, which is the requirement of the problem.
