Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `b`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`) remain unchanged.
