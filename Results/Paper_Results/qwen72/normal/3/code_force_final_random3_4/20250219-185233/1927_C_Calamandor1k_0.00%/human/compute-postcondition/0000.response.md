Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and `k` is even. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of values `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.**
