Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`**.
