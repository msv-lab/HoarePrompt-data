Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine the value of `count` and what will be printed by the `print(count * 2)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a list of characters.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `j` is calculated as `n // 2 - 1`.
- `k` is 2.
- `count` can be either 3, 1, or 0 based on the following conditions:
  - If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, `count` is either 3 or 1.
  - If none of the above conditions are met, `count` is 0.
  - `count` is not equal to `j`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `j`**:
   - `j = n // 2 - 1`
   - Since `n` is the length of `s` and `n >= 3`, `j` will be a non-negative integer. For example, if `n = 3`, then `j = 3 // 2 - 1 = 0`. If `n = 4`, then `j = 4 // 2 - 1 = 1`.

2. **Determine `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`**:
   - `k` is 2.
   - `s[k]` is the character at index 2 in the list `s`.
   - `s[k + j]` is the character at index `2 + j` in the list `s`.

3. **Check the conditions for `count`**:
   - If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is either 3 or 1.
   - If none of these conditions are met, `count` is 0.
   - `count` is not equal to `j`.

4. **Determine the value of `count`**:
   - Since `count` can be 3, 1, or 0, and it is not equal to `j`, we need to consider the possible values of `j`.
   - If `j` is 0, then `count` cannot be 0.
   - If `j` is 1, then `count` cannot be 1.
   - If `j` is 2, then `count` cannot be 2 (but since `count` can only be 3, 1, or 0, this is not a concern).

5. **Evaluate the conditions**:
   - If `s[2]` is '?' or `s[2 + j]` is '?' or `s[2]` equals `s[2 + j]`, then `count` is either 3 or 1.
   - If none of these conditions are met, `count` is 0.
   - Given that `count` is not equal to `j`, if `j` is 0, `count` must be 3 or 1. If `j` is 1, `count` must be 3 or 0. If `j` is 2, `count` must be 3 or 1.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The `print(count * 2)` statement will print the value of `count` multiplied by 2.
   - If `count` is 3, then `count * 2` is 6.
   - If `count` is 1, then `count * 2` is 2.
   - If `count` is 0, then `count * 2` is 0.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions and the constraints, the value of `count` can be either 3 or 1 (since it cannot be equal to `j` and must satisfy the given conditions). Therefore, the output will be either 6 or 2.

Output: **6 or 2 (depending on the initial conditions and the values of `s[2]` and `s[2 + j]`)**
