Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 1. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program returns nothing, and `count` retains its value as either 2 or 0, depending on the initial conditions. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2, and `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not equal to '?'. Otherwise, `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`, and `count` is 0. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.***
