Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

In the provided code snippet, there is a return statement without any value or variable being returned. This means the function will return `None` by default in Python, but since the task specifies to avoid describing how the program runs and to focus on the state, the output state is that the program returns nothing. The variables and their conditions as described in the initial state do not change or affect the return statement directly.
