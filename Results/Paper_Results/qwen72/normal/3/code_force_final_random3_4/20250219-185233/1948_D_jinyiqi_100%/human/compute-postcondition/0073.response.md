Output State: **The program returns the value of `count`, which is either 1 or 0, depending on whether the conditions for `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are met.** 

- If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1 and the program returns 1.
- Otherwise, `count` is set to 0 and the program returns 0.
