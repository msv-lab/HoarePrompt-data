Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the string `s` for each test case and converts it into a list of characters.
   - It initializes `n` to the length of the string `s`.
   - The outer loop iterates over possible half-lengths of tandem repeats, starting from the largest possible half-length (`n // 2`) down to 1. This is a good approach because it ensures that the program finds the longest possible tandem repeat first.
   - The inner loop checks for tandem repeats by comparing pairs of characters at positions `k` and `k + j`. If the characters are either the same or at least one of them is a question mark, it increments the `count`. If the characters do not match and neither is a question mark, it resets the `count`.
   - If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the function prints `2 * j` and returns immediately.
   - If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the function prints `0`.

3. **Logic for Tandem Repeats**:
   - The condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` correctly identifies pairs of characters that can form part of a tandem repeat. This includes:
     - Both characters being the same.
     - At least one of the characters being a question mark, which can be replaced to match the other character.
   - The `count` variable is used to track the number of consecutive pairs that satisfy the condition. If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string has no question marks and no tandem repeats by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where the string is entirely made up of question marks, which can be replaced to form the longest possible tandem repeat.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, which is acceptable given the constraints \(1 \le |s| \le 5000\) and the total length of all strings not exceeding 5000.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
