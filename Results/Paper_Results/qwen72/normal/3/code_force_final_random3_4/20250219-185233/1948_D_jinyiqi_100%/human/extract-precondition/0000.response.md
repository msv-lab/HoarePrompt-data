Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take a string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the string `s` and possibly the number of test cases `t` as parameters. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of strings, each representing a test case.
