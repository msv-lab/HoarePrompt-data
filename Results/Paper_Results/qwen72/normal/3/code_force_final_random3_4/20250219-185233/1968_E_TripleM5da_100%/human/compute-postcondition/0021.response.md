Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` remains unchanged.**

Natural language description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the same value as `n`, and the value of `n` will remain unchanged from its initial value. This is because the loop starts at `i = 3` and increments `i` by 1 with each iteration until `i` reaches `n + 1`, at which point the loop stops. Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `n`.
