Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` set to 3 and iterates as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute until `i` becomes `n + 1`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution, and it must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute at least once.
