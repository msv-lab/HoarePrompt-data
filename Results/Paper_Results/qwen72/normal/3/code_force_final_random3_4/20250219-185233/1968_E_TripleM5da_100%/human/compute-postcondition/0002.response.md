The given code snippet is:
```
print(1, 1)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.

However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the constants `1` and `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **1 1**
