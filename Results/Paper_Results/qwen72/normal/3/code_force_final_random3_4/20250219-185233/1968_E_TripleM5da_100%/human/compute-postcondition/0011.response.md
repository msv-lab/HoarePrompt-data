To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(0, int(input())):
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `i`
- The upper bound of the range, which is determined by `int(input())`

Let's break down the state adjustments step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
   - For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
   - `i` is `n`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The upper bound of the range is `int(input())`, which is a new input value for each test case. However, since `i` is already `n` and the loop is about to start again, the new value of `i` should be 0 for the next test case.

4. **Final State:**
   - `i` should be reset to 0 for the next test case.
   - The upper bound of the range, `int(input())`, will be determined by the next input value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 0, and the upper bound of the range is `int(input())`**.
