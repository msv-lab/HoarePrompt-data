The code snippet provided is:
```
print(i, i)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `i` is 5.
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 5, but it is not used in the print statement.

The `print` statement will print the value of `i` twice. Since `i` is explicitly defined as 5, the output will be:

Output: **5, 5**
