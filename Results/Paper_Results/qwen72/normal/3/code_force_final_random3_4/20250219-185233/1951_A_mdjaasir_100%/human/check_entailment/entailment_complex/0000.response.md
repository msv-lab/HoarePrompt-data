Reasoning: 

The provided annotated program is not related to the original problem description and function `generate_files_for_html_in_range`. The original function is designed to generate Python files for each `.html` file in subfolders whose names fall within a specified range of integers. The annotated program, on the other hand, is a separate function that processes a series of test cases and checks for the presence of '1's in a string, printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions.

Since the annotated program is not part of the original problem, we should focus on the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function based on the problem description and the comments provided.

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is supposed to generate two Python files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file in subfolders whose names are integers within a specified range.
2. **Directory Handling**: The function correctly retrieves the current working directory and lists all subfolders.
3. **Range Check**: The function checks if the subfolder name is a digit and falls within the specified range.
4. **HTML File Generation**: For each subfolder that meets the criteria, the function lists all `.html` files and generates corresponding `-ac.py` and `-wa.py` files.
5. **Output**: The function prints the number of HTML files in each qualifying subfolder and the paths of the generated Python files.

Based on the problem description and the provided comments, the function appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
