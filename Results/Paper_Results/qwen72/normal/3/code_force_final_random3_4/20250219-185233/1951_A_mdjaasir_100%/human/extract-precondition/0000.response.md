It seems there is a mismatch between the provided problem description and the function definition. The problem description outlines a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that generates files based on a range of folder names and the presence of HTML files within those folders. However, the function definition provided is simply `def func():` without any parameters. 

For the purpose of this task, I will assume the correct function definition should be `def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):` and provide the precondition based on this assumption.

Precondition: **start and end are integers where 0 <= start <= end, and the current working directory contains subfolders with names that can be interpreted as integers.**
