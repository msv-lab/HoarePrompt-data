### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters:**
   - The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is defined to take two integer parameters, `start` and `end`.
   - The problem description states that `start` and `end` are integers where `0 <= start <= end`.

2. **Current Working Directory and Subfolders:**
   - The function uses `os.getcwd()` to get the current working directory.
   - It then uses `os.scandir(current_dir)` to list all entries in the current directory and filters out only the subfolders using `f.is_dir()`.

3. **Checking Subfolder Names:**
   - For each subfolder, the function checks if the folder name is a digit and if it falls within the specified range (`start <= int(folder_name) <= end`).

4. **HTML Files in Subfolders:**
   - If the subfolder name is within the range, the function lists all files in the subfolder that end with `.html` using `f.endswith('.html')`.
   - It prints the number of HTML files in the subfolder.

5. **Generating New Files:**
   - For each `.html` file, the function generates two new files: one with `-ac.py` appended to the base name and one with `-wa.py` appended.
   - It uses `os.path.splitext(html_file)[0]` to get the base name of the HTML file.
   - It then creates the new file paths using `os.path.join(folder, f"{base_name}-ac.py")` and `os.path.join(folder, f"{base_name}-wa.py")`.
   - The function creates these files using `open(ac_file, 'w').close()` and `open(wa_file, 'w').close()`.
   - It prints the paths of the generated files.

6. **Main Block:**
   - The main block specifies the range `start_range = 1951` and `end_range = 1980`.
   - It calls the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start_range, end_range)`.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
- The annotated program provided is unrelated to the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function. It appears to be a different function `func()` that processes input strings and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions.
- The state comments in the annotated program describe the state of the `func()` function, which is not relevant to the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

### Conclusion:
- The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correct based on the problem description and the provided comments.
- The annotated program is not related to the function in question and does not affect the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

### Correctness:
**True**
