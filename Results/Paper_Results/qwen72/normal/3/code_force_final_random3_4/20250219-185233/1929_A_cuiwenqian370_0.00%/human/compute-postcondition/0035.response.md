Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is `n-1`, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a modified order, `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The variables `left` and `right` remain unchanged at `n` and `-1`, respectively, because they are not modified within the loop.
- `new_arr` is a list that contains all elements of `arr` in a modified order. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` is appended to `new_arr` once. If `n` is even, elements are appended in pairs, with each pair consisting of the rightmost and leftmost elements of the current subarray of `arr` at each iteration.
- `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`. This means that for each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr`, the absolute difference between them is calculated and added to `max_beauty`.

Thus, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `max_beauty` will contain the total sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
