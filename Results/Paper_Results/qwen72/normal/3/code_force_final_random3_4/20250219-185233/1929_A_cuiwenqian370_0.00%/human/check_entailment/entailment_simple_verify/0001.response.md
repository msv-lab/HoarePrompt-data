Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to rearrange the elements of an array to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Specifically, we need to maximize the sum \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It then constructs a new array by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted array.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array is a good first step because it helps in understanding the distribution of the elements.
   - **Constructing the New Array**: The program constructs the new array by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted array. This approach ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other, which maximizes the absolute differences.
   - **Calculating the Beauty**: The program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array. This is correct because the absolute difference \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) is always non-negative and maximized when the elements are placed in a way that maximizes the differences.

4. **Verification**:
   - **Test Case 1**: For the array \([2, 1, 3]\), sorting gives \([1, 2, 3]\). The new array is \([3, 1, 2]\). The beauty is \((3 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 2 + 1 = 3\). However, the correct answer should be 2, which is achieved by the array \([1, 2, 3]\). The program's approach is incorrect here.
   - **Test Case 2**: For the array \([69, 69, 69]\), sorting gives \([69, 69, 69]\). The new array is \([69, 69, 69]\). The beauty is \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0\). This is correct.
   - **Test Case 3**: For the array \([100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\), sorting gives \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\). The new array is \([100, 43, 90, 54, 80]\). The beauty is \((100 - 43) + (90 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 54) = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166\). However, the correct answer should be 57, which is achieved by the array \([43, 100, 54, 90, 80]\). The program's approach is incorrect here.
   - **Test Case 4**: For the array \([3, 4, 3, 3]\), sorting gives \([3, 3, 3, 4]\). The new array is \([4, 3, 3, 3]\). The beauty is \((4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1\). This is correct.
   - **Test Case 5**: For the array \([2, 1]\), sorting gives \([1, 2]\). The new array is \([2, 1]\). The beauty is \((2 - 1) = 1\). This is correct.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's approach of sorting the array and then constructing a new array by alternating elements from the end and the beginning is not always correct. It fails to maximize the beauty in some cases, as shown in Test Case 1 and Test Case 3.
   - The calculation of the beauty is correct, but the construction of the new array is flawed.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
