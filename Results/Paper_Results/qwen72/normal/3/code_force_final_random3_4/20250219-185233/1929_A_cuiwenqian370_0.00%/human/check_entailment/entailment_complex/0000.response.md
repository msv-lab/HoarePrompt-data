Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To achieve this, the program follows these steps:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the Array**: For each test case, the array \(arr\) is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Rearranging the Array**: The program then rearranges the elements of the sorted array into a new array \(new_arr\) by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
4. **Calculating the Beauty**: The program calculates the beauty of the rearranged array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
5. **Output**: The beauty values for each test case are stored in a list and printed at the end.

Let's break down the correctness of each step:

- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array is a valid step because it helps in identifying the largest and smallest elements easily.
- **Rearranging the Array**: The rearrangement strategy of alternating between the largest and smallest elements ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the largest possible difference between any two elements in the array is achieved by pairing the largest and smallest elements.
- **Calculating the Beauty**: The calculation of the beauty using the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array is correct. The absolute value ensures that the differences are always positive, which is necessary for the sum to be maximized.
- **Output**: The output is correct as it prints the beauty values for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
