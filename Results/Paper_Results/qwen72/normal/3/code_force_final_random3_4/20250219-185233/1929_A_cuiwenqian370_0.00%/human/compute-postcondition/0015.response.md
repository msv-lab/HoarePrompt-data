Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`, and the last element of `new_arr` is `arr[right]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100.
- The list `arr` remains a sorted list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9.
- The value of `left` remains 1.
- The value of `right` remains `n - 2`.
- The list `new_arr` initially contains the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr` (since `left` is not equal to `right`).
- The code appends `arr[right]` to `new_arr`, so the last element of `new_arr` is now `arr[right]`.
