The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is 1 and `right` is `n - 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must still be less than or equal to `right`. Since `left` is 1 and `right` is `n - 2`, the condition `1 <= n - 2` must hold true. This simplifies to `n >= 3`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, the condition `n >= 3` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`.**
