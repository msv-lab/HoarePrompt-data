Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, and `arr[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `new_arr.append(arr[left])` appends the element at index `left` (which is 1) of the list `arr` to the list `new_arr`.
- Initially, `new_arr` contains either the first element of `arr` (if `left` is equal to `right`) or the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr` (if `left` is not equal to `right`).
- After appending `arr[1]` to `new_arr`, `new_arr` now contains the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, and `arr[1]`.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
