Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a modified order. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` is appended to `new_arr` once. If `n` is even, all elements of `arr` are appended to `new_arr` in pairs, with each pair consisting of the rightmost and leftmost elements of the current subarray of `arr` at each iteration.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `left` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the left pointer has moved past the last index of `arr`.
- The variable `right` will be equal to `-1`, indicating that the right pointer has moved before the first index of `arr`.
- The list `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr`, but in a modified order. Specifically:
  - If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` will be appended to `new_arr` once, and all other elements will be appended in pairs, with each pair consisting of the rightmost and leftmost elements of the current subarray of `arr` at each iteration.
  - If `n` is even, all elements of `arr` will be appended to `new_arr` in pairs, with each pair consisting of the rightmost and leftmost elements of the current subarray of `arr` at each iteration.
