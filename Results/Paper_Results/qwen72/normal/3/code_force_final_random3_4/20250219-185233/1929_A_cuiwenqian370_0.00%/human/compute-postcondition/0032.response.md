Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a modified order, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])`**

Explanation: The value of `max_beauty` is updated by adding the absolute difference between the elements at indices `i` and `i-1` of `new_arr`. Since `i` is 2, the new value of `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute difference between the first and second elements of `new_arr` and the absolute difference between the second and third elements of `new_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
