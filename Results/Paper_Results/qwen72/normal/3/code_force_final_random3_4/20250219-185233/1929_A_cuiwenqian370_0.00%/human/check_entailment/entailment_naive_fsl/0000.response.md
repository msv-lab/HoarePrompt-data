Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The issue lies in the way the array is rearranged in the `func_1` function. The function sorts the array and then alternately appends the largest and smallest elements to a new array. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```
The expected output should be 6, which can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, giving a beauty of `(4-1) + (2-4) + (3-2) = 3 + (-2) + 1 = 6`. However, the program will rearrange the array to `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, which gives a beauty of `(1-4) + (3-1) + (2-3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
