Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a modified order. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` is appended to `new_arr` once. If `n` is even, all elements of `arr` are appended to `new_arr` in pairs, with each pair consisting of the rightmost and leftmost elements of the current subarray of `arr` at each iteration. `max_beauty` is 0.**
