To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `i` is 2
- `left` is `n`
- `right` is `-1`
- `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a modified order
- `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current State of `i` and `n`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

### Final State:
- `i` is incremented to 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

### State:
**`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 3, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` is a list containing all elements of `arr` in a modified order, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])`**
