Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The binary search approach used in the program is not appropriate for this problem because the profit function is not monotonic (it does not consistently increase or decrease as `k` increases). Instead, the profit function can have a peak at some value of `k` and then decrease, which means that a binary search might not find the maximum profit.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to calculate the profit for each possible value of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and find the maximum profit. However, since `n` and `b` can be very large, we need a more efficient way to find the maximum profit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            # If the usual price is greater than or equal to the modified price, sell all buns at the usual price.
            print(n * a)
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum profit by selling the first k buns at the modified price.
            k = min(n, b)
            profit = (k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2 + (n - k) * a
            print(profit)
```

### Explanation:
1. **If `a >= b`:** In this case, it is always better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price `b` is not more profitable.
2. **If `a < b`:** We need to calculate the profit for the first `k` buns sold at the modified price. The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-k+1)`. This sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series: \(\frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2}\). The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

This approach ensures that we find the maximum profit efficiently without the need for a binary search.
