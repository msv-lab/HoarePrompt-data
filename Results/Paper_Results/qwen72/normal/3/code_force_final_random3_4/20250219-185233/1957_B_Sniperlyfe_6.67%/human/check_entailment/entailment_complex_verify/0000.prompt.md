You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is now \(k - n \cdot (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)\), and `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\).
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) except the last element which is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1 + k\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element, except the last, is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). The last element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1 + k\). After the function concludes, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `nums` is a list of integers as described.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n`. According to the problem description, the sum of the sequence must equal `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence should be maximized. However, the current implementation always assigns the maximum possible value to each element in the sequence, which can lead to the sum exceeding `k`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 2
```
Here, `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The program will generate the sequence `[1, 1, 0]`, which sums to 2, but the bitwise OR of the sequence is `1 | 1 | 0 = 1`, which has only one 1 in its binary representation. However, a correct solution would be `[2, 0, 0]`, which also sums to 2, and the bitwise OR is `2 | 0 | 0 = 2`, which has two 1s in its binary representation (if we consider the binary representation of 2 as `10`).

This shows that the program does not always produce a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, especially when `k` is small compared to `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
