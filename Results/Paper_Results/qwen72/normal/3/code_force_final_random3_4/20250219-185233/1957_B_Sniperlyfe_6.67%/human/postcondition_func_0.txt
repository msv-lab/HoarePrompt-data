The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element, except the last, is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). The last element is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1 + k\). After the function concludes, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `nums` is a list of integers as described.
