Postcondition: ***`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string `'Draw'` or the string `'Alice'`, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. Either `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even, or `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains the string `'Draw'` if either `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1 and the condition `(clues[5] - 2 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true, `answers` contains the string `'Draw'`. In all other cases, `answers` contains the string `'Alice'`.***
