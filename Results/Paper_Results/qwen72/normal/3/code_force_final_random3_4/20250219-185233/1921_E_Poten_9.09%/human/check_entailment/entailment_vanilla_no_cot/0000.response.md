Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly handle all the conditions of the game as described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues:

1. The program does not correctly determine the winner when Alice and Bob have chips on the same row but different columns. The logic for checking the distance between the chips in the y-axis is overly complex and incorrect in some cases.

2. The program incorrectly handles the case where Alice's chip is in the last row or Bob's chip is in the first row. According to the problem, if a player cannot make a move, the game ends in a draw. However, the program only checks if `x_a > x_b` or if the board height is 1, which is not sufficient.

3. The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the row numbers (`x_a` and `x_b`) is flawed. The program assumes that if both `x_a` and `x_b` are even or both are odd, Bob wins if the y-coordinates are the same. This is not always correct, as it depends on the relative positions and the number of moves required to reach the same row.

4. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice and Bob can move to the same cell in the next move, which should result in a win for the player who moves first.

A more accurate solution would involve a simpler approach to determine the winner based on the relative positions of the chips and the number of moves required to potentially reach the same cell. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    answers = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # If Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, it's a draw
        if x_a == h or x_b == 1:
            answers.append('Draw')
        # If Alice and Bob are in the same row and the same column, it's a draw
        elif x_a == x_b and y_a == y_b:
            answers.append('Draw')
        # If Alice can move to Bob's current position in one move, Alice wins
        elif x_a + 1 == x_b and (y_a == y_b or y_a + 1 == y_b or y_a - 1 == y_b):
            answers.append('Alice')
        # If Bob can move to Alice's current position in one move, Bob wins
        elif x_b - 1 == x_a and (y_b == y_a or y_b + 1 == y_a or y_b - 1 == y_a):
            answers.append('Bob')
        # Otherwise, check if Alice can win by reaching Bob's row before Bob can reach Alice's row
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of moves Alice and Bob need to reach the same row
            moves_to_same_row = (x_b - x_a) // 2
            if (x_b - x_a) % 2 == 1:
                answers.append('Alice')
            else:
                # Check if Alice can reach Bob's row and column before Bob can reach Alice's row and column
                if abs(y_a - y_b) <= moves_to_same_row:
                    answers.append('Alice')
                else:
                    answers.append('Draw')
    
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)

func()
```

This corrected version handles the game rules more accurately and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.
