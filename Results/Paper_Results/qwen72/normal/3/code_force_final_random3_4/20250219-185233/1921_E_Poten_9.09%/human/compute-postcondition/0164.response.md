The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `answers`. For the loop to execute, `answers` must contain at least one element. The state of `i` and `test_cases` are not relevant to the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`answers` is a list that must have at least one string ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), `j` is the first string in the `answers` list**
