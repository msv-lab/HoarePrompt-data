The code snippet `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial state does not specify the value of `answers`, so we assume `answers` is an existing list. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `answers` now contains the string 'Draw'.**
