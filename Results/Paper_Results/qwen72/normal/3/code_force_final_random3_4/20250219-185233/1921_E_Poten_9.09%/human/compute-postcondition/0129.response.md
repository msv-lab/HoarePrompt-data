The code snippet `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `i`, `clues`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `answers` now includes the string 'Draw'.**
