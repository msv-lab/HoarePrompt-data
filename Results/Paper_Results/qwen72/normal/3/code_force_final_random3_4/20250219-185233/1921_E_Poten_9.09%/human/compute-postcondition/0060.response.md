Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, and either `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even, or `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and the current value of `clues[3]` is less than the current value of `clues[5]`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, and if `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, and if the condition `(clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true, `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Alice'.**
