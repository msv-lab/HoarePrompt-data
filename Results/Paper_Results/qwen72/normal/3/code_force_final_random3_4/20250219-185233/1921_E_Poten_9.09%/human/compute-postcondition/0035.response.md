Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, and either `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1. The current value of `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, or the current value of `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2.**
