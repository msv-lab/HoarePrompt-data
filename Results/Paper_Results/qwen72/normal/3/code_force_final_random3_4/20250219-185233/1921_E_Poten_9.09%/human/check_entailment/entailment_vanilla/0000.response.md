### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the input values for `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The function checks if `x_a` is greater than `x_b` or if the board height `h` is 1. If either condition is true, it appends "Draw" to the answers list. This is correct because:
     - If `x_a > x_b`, Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, and they cannot meet.
     - If `h == 1`, there is only one row, so neither player can move, resulting in a draw.

3. **Parity Check**:
   - The function checks the parity of `x_a` and `x_b` (whether they are both even or both odd). This is a key part of the logic because the parity of the row numbers determines whether Alice and Bob can potentially meet on the same row.
   - If both `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity and `y_a == y_b`, Bob wins because he can always move to the same column as Alice on his turn.
   - If both `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity and `y_a < y_b` or `y_a > y_b`, the function checks if the distance between `y_a` and `y_b` is greater than 1 and if the difference in their row positions divided by 2 (i.e., the number of turns it would take for them to meet) is greater than the distance in columns. If so, it appends "Draw". Otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Different Parity**:
   - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities, the function checks if `y_a == y_b`. If true, Alice wins because she can always move to the same column as Bob on her turn.
   - If `y_a < y_b` or `y_a > y_b`, the function checks if the distance between `y_a` and `y_b` is greater than 1 and if the difference in their row positions divided by 2 is greater than the distance in columns. If so, it appends "Draw". Otherwise, Alice wins.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case, which is the correct way to handle multiple test cases.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: `x_a > x_b` or `h == 1`**:
  - This correctly identifies situations where a draw is inevitable because Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip or the board is too small for any movement.

- **Case 2: Same Parity**:
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity and `y_a == y_b`, Bob wins because he can always move to the same column as Alice.
  - If `y_a < y_b` or `y_a > y_b` and the distance in columns is greater than 1, the function checks if the distance in columns is greater than the number of turns it would take for them to meet. This is correct because if the distance is too large, they cannot meet, resulting in a draw. Otherwise, Bob wins.

- **Case 3: Different Parity**:
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities and `y_a == y_b`, Alice wins because she can always move to the same column as Bob.
  - If `y_a < y_b` or `y_a > y_b` and the distance in columns is greater than 1, the function checks if the distance in columns is greater than the number of turns it would take for them to meet. This is correct because if the distance is too large, they cannot meet, resulting in a draw. Otherwise, Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem and follows the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.
