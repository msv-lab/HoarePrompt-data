Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, and either `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1.**
