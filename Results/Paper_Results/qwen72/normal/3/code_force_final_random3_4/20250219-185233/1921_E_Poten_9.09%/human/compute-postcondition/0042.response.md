Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, and either `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is not equal to 1. Additionally, either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains the string 'Bob'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Draw' if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 and the conditions for `clues[3] - 1` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` being greater than or equal to the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2 are met. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, `answers` contains the string 'Draw' if the conditions for `clues[3] - 1` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` being greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2 are met. In all other cases, `answers` contains the string 'Bob'.**
