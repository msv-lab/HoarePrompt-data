You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the input values for `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The function checks if `x_a` is greater than `x_b` or if the board height `h` is 1. If either condition is true, it appends "Draw" to the answers list. This is correct because:
     - If `x_a > x_b`, Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, and they cannot meet.
     - If `h == 1`, there is only one row, so neither player can move, resulting in a draw.

3. **Parity Check**:
   - The function checks the parity of `x_a` and `x_b` (whether they are both even or both odd). This is a key part of the logic because the parity of the row numbers determines whether Alice and Bob can potentially meet on the same row.
   - If both `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity and `y_a == y_b`, Bob wins because he can always move to the same column as Alice on his turn.
   - If both `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity and `y_a < y_b` or `y_a > y_b`, the function checks if the distance between `y_a` and `y_b` is greater than 1 and if the difference in their row positions divided by 2 (i.e., the number of turns it would take for them to meet) is greater than the distance in columns. If so, it appends "Draw". Otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Different Parity**:
   - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities, the function checks if `y_a == y_b`. If true, Alice wins because she can always move to the same column as Bob on her turn.
   - If `y_a < y_b` or `y_a > y_b`, the function checks if the distance between `y_a` and `y_b` is greater than 1 and if the difference in their row positions divided by 2 is greater than the distance in columns. If so, it appends "Draw". Otherwise, Alice wins.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case, which is the correct way to handle multiple test cases.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: `x_a > x_b` or `h == 1`**:
  - This correctly identifies situations where a draw is inevitable because Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip or the board is too small for any movement.

- **Case 2: Same Parity**:
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity and `y_a == y_b`, Bob wins because he can always move to the same column as Alice.
  - If `y_a < y_b` or `y_a > y_b` and the distance in columns is greater than 1, the function checks if the distance in columns is greater than the number of turns it would take for them to meet. This is correct because if the distance is too large, they cannot meet, resulting in a draw. Otherwise, Bob wins.

- **Case 3: Different Parity**:
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities and `y_a == y_b`, Alice wins because she can always move to the same column as Bob.
  - If `y_a < y_b` or `y_a > y_b` and the distance in columns is greater than 1, the function checks if the distance in columns is greater than the number of turns it would take for them to meet. This is correct because if the distance is too large, they cannot meet, resulting in a draw. Otherwise, Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem and follows the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.
