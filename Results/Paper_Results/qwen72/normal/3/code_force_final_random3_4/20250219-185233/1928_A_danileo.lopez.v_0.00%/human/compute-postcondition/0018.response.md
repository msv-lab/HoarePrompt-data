Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is `t-1`, and `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input. If `a` is even or `b` is even, the program does not modify `a` or `b`. Otherwise, if both `a` and `b` are odd, the program does not modify `a` or `b`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is only used to determine the number of iterations.
- **`_`**: This variable is the loop counter. After all iterations, `_` will be `t-1` because the loop starts with `_` at 0 and increments it by 1 for each iteration.
- **`a` and `b`**: These variables are updated with new user input at the start of each iteration. They are not modified within the loop body; they are only checked to determine whether to print 'Yes' or 'No'. Therefore, after all iterations, `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last user input provided.

The loop simply checks the parity (even or odd) of `a` and `b` for each test case and prints 'Yes' if at least one of them is even, or 'No' if both are odd. The values of `a` and `b` are not retained or modified between iterations.
