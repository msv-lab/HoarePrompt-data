Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.** 

The values of `a` and `b` are now updated to the integers provided by the user input, and the initial state of `t` and `_` remains unchanged. The conditions for executing the if or else part are now based on the new values of `a` and `b`.
