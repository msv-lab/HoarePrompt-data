The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an input integer with a constraint (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which already ensures that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

For the loop to execute, the state should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0**
