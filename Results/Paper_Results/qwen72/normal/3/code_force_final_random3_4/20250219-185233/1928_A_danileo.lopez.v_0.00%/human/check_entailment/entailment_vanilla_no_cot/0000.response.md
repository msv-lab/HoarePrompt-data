Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by checking if either dimension \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one dimension is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it is not possible to form a different rectangle, as cutting an odd-dimensioned rectangle will always result in smaller rectangles that, when combined, will form the original rectangle or a rotated version of it. The program outputs "Yes" for even dimensions and "No" for both dimensions being odd, which aligns with the problem description.
