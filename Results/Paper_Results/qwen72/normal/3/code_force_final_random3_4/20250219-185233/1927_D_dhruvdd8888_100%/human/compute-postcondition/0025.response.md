Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of contiguous segments of the same number in the `nums` list, along with the number itself. The variable `s` is the index of the last segment's start position, and `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
