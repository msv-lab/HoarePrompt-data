Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `num` is equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`. If the element at index 0 of the list `nums` is not equal to `num`, `arr` contains an additional tuple `(1, 0, num)` at the end, and `s` is 0. Otherwise, the state of `arr` and `s` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `num` is now equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`.
- The values of `N`, `i`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged, but the condition for `arr` and `s` is still valid based on the new value of `num`.
