Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to `nums[1]`, `s` is 2, and `arr` contains an additional tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])` at the end. If `nums[1] == nums[0]` and `arr` initially contained an additional tuple `(1, 0, nums[0])` at the end, this tuple remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `N` remains a non-negative integer.
- `i` remains 2.
- `num` remains equal to `nums[1]`.
- `s` is now assigned the value of `i`, which is 2.
- The tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])` is added to `arr`, where `s` is now 2, so the tuple becomes `(3, 2, nums[1])`.
- If `nums[1] == nums[0]`, the initial tuple `(1, 0, nums[0])` in `arr` remains unchanged.
