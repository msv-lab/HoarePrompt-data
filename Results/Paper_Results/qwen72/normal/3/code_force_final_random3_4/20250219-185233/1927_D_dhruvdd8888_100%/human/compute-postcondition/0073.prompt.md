Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of contiguous segments of the same number in the `nums` list, along with the number itself. The variable `s` is the index of the last segment's start position, and `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N or e < l:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `LA` is the length of `arr`. If `s` > `l`, then `s` is greater than `l`. If `s` is 1 or greater than `r`, the current value of `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `r`. If `s` ≤ `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, then the current value of `e` is greater than or equal to `r`. If `e` is less than `r`, then the current value of `e` is less than `r`. Additionally, if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, then the current value of `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`. Otherwise, `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 1), `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `LA` is the length of `arr`. If `s` > `l`, and `s` is 1 or `s` is greater than `r`, the variables retain their values. If `s` > `l` and `s` is between `l` and `r` (inclusive), the variables also retain their values. If `s` ≤ `l`, and `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the program maintains the values of `s`, `e`, and `_` as described in the precondition. If `s` ≤ `l` and `e` is less than `r`, the program also maintains the values of `s`, `e`, and `_` as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (unchanged), `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `l` and `r` are the integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `LA` is the length of `arr`. If `s` > `l`, and if `s` is 1 or `s` is greater than `r`, the variables retain their values. If `s` ≤ `l`, and if `e` is greater than or equal to `r` or `e` is less than `r`, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
