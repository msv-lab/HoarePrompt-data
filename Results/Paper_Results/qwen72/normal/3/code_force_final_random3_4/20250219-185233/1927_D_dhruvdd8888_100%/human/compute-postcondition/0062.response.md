Output State: **`_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 2), `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `l` and `r` are the integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `LA` is the length of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `eli` is updated to the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
- The values of `_`, `s`, and `e` are derived from the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, with `_` being the third element incremented by 2, `s` being the first element, and `e` being the second element.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
- The values of `l` and `r` are still the integers provided by the user input.
- The value of `LA` remains the length of `arr`.
