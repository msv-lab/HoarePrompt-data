Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **`_`**: This is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 1).
2. **`s`**: This is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
3. **`e`**: This is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
4. **`int(input())`**: This must be greater than 1.
5. **`l` and `r`**: These are integers provided by the user input.
6. **`eli`**: This is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
7. **`LA`**: This is the length of `arr`.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print(-1, -1)
```

The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`. The values of the variables `_`, `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, and `LA` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **-1, -1**
