Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying segments of the array where the elements are the same and then using these segments to answer the queries. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Segment Identification**: The program identifies segments of the array where the elements are the same and stores them in the `arr` list. This is done by iterating through the array and grouping consecutive elements that are equal. The `arr` list contains tuples of the form `(start, end, value)`, where `start` is the starting index of the segment, `end` is the ending index, and `value` is the value of the elements in the segment.

2. **Query Processing**: For each query `(l, r)`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or after `l`. It then checks if the segment's start index is within the query range and if the segment's end index is within the query range. Based on these checks, it prints the indices of the elements that are different, or `(-1, -1)` if no such pair exists.

However, the logic for handling the queries is flawed:

- **Incorrect Segment Check**: The program checks if the segment's start index is greater than `l` and if the segment's end index is less than `r`. This is not the correct approach to find a pair of different elements within the range `[l, r]`. Instead, it should check if there are any two elements within the range `[l, r]` that are different.

- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the entire range `[l, r]` consists of the same element, it should print `(-1, -1)`, but the current logic might print incorrect indices.

- **Appending `-1` to `nums`**: The program appends `-1` to the `nums` array to handle the end of the array. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect behavior if the array already contains `-1`.

- **Reading Input Inside `func_1`**: The function `func_1` reads input using `sys.stdin.readline`, which is not necessary since the input is already read in the main loop. This can lead to issues if the input is not read correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
