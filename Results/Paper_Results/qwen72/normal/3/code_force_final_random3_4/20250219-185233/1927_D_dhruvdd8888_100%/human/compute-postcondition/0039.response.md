Postcondition: **`_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `LA` is the length of `arr`, `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and `e` is less than `r`.**
