Output State: **`_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 1), `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `LA` is the length of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `eli` is updated to the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
- All other variables (`_`, `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `int(input())`, and `LA`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
