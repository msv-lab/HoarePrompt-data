The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `N + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `N` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 1.
- `num` is equal to `nums[1]`.
- `s` is 0 unless `nums[1] != nums[0]`, in which case `s` is 1 and `arr` contains an additional tuple `(1, 1, nums[1])` at the end. If `nums[1] == nums[0]` and `arr` initially contained an additional tuple `(1, 0, nums[0])` at the end, this tuple remains unchanged.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2.
- For the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `i` is 2 and the loop condition is `i < N + 1`).

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to `nums[1]`, `s` is 0 unless `nums[1] != nums[0]`, in which case `s` is 1 and `arr` contains an additional tuple `(1, 1, nums[1])` at the end. If `nums[1] == nums[0]` and `arr` initially contained an additional tuple `(1, 0, nums[0])` at the end, this tuple remains unchanged.**
