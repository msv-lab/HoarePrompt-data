Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
2. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
3. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
4. `int(input())` must be greater than 2.
5. `l` and `r` are the integers provided by the user input.
6. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
7. `LA` is the length of `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s, e + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input:**
   - The user provides two integers, `l` and `r`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 2. This means that `l` and `r` are both integers, and `l` must be greater than 2.

2. **Determine `eli`:**
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - This implies that `arr` is a list of tuples, and `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` fits in the sorted order of `arr`.

3. **Determine `LA`:**
   - `LA` is the length of `arr`.

4. **Determine `min(eli, LA)`:**
   - `min(eli, LA)` will be the smaller of `eli` and `LA`.
   - If `eli` is less than `LA`, `min(eli, LA)` will be `eli`.
   - If `eli` is greater than or equal to `LA`, `min(eli, LA)` will be `LA`.

5. **Access Tuple Elements:**
   - The tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is accessed.
   - `_` is the third element of this tuple.
   - `s` is the first element of this tuple.
   - `e` is the second element of this tuple.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print the first element of the tuple (`s`) and the second element of the tuple plus 1 (`e + 1`).

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, and `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and conditions.

- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e + 1` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` plus 1.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and e is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`)**
