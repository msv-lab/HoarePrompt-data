Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
2. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
3. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
4. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
5. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
6. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
7. `LA` is the length of `arr`.
8. `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
9. `e` is less than `r`.
10. `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.
11. `e` is greater than or equal to `l`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet `print(-1, -1)` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The `print` statement will always print the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `arr`, `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `LA`, or `N`.

### Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
