Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing the length of the array `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), the array `a` (a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and a list of queries `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5), where each query is a tuple of two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `input` is a string read from the standard input. `N` is assigned the value of the integer converted from the input string. `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end. `s` is 0. `e` is 0. `num` is the first integer in the `nums` list. `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `num` is equal to the element at index 0 of the list `nums`. If the element at index 0 of the list `nums` is not equal to `num`, `arr` contains an additional tuple `(1, 0, num)` at the end, and `s` is 0. Otherwise, the state of `arr` and `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `num` is equal to `nums[1]`, `s` is 0 unless `nums[1] != nums[0]`, in which case `s` is 1 and `arr` contains an additional tuple `(1, 1, nums[1])` at the end. If `nums[1] == nums[0]` and `arr` initially contained an additional tuple `(1, 0, nums[0])` at the end, this tuple remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to `nums[2]`. If `nums[2] != nums[1]`, `s` is 2, and `arr` contains an additional tuple `(3, 2, nums[1])` at the end. If `nums[1] == nums[0]` and `arr` initially contained an additional tuple `(1, 0, nums[0])` at the end, this tuple remains unchanged. If `nums[2] == nums[1]`, `s` remains 0 unless `nums[1] != nums[0]`, in which case `s` remains 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
