Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to `nums[1]`, `s` is 0 unless `nums[1] != nums[0]`, in which case `s` is 1, and `arr` contains an additional tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])` at the end. If `nums[1] == nums[0]` and `arr` initially contained an additional tuple `(1, 0, nums[0])` at the end, this tuple remains unchanged.**
