Let's break down the precondition and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Precondition Analysis:
1. `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
2. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
3. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
4. `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
5. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
6. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
7. `LA` is the length of `arr`.
8. `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
9. The current value of `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **User Input**: The precondition states that `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means that the user will provide a positive integer.
2. **Variables `l` and `r`**: These are integers provided by the user input. Their exact values are not specified, but they are known to be provided by the user.
3. **Index Calculation**: `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. This index is determined based on the sorted order of the first elements of the tuples in `arr`.
4. **Length of `arr`**: `LA` is the length of `arr`.
5. **Minimum Index**: `min(eli, LA)` will be the minimum of the index `eli` and the length `LA`. Since `eli` is an index, it must be less than or equal to `LA`, so `min(eli, LA)` will always be `eli`.
6. **Tuple Elements**: The tuple at index `eli` in `arr` has elements:
   - `s` is the first element.
   - `e` is the second element.
   - `_` is the third element.
7. **Conditions on `s` and `e`**:
   - `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.

### Output Analysis:
The code snippet `print(-1, -1)` is a simple print statement that prints the values `-1` and `-1`. The values of `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, and `_` are not used in this print statement. Therefore, the output is independent of the precondition and the values of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
