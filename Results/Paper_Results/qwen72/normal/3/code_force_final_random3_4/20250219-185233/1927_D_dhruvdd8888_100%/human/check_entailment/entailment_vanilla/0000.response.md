### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It creates an array `arr` to store tuples of the form `(start, end, value)` where `start` and `end` are the indices of a segment of the array where all elements are equal to `value`.

3. **Segment Identification**:
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and identifies segments where all elements are the same.
   - It appends these segments to `arr` as tuples `(1 + s, i, num)`, where `s` is the start index of the segment and `i` is the end index of the segment.
   - The `+1` in `1 + s` is to convert from 0-based indexing to 1-based indexing.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it reads the range `[l, r]`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It retrieves the segment `(s, e, _)` from `arr` at index `min(eli, LA)`, where `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - It checks various conditions to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists within the range `[l, r]`.

5. **Conditions for Valid Pair**:
   - If `s > l`, it checks if `s == 1` or `s > r`. If either condition is true, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair). Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
   - If `e >= r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).
   - If `e < N` or `e < l`, it prints `(s, e + 1)`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive equal elements.
- The use of `bisect_left` helps in efficiently finding the starting segment within the query range.
- The conditions for checking the validity of the pair `(i, j)` are logically sound:
  - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it checks if the segment starts at the beginning of the array or is outside the query range.
  - If the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it means the segment covers the entire query range, and no valid pair exists.
  - If the end of the segment is less than `N` or `l`, it prints a valid pair from the segment.
  - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where the segment identified by `bisect_left` is exactly at the boundary of the query range. For example, if the segment starts at `l` and ends at `r`, and all elements in this segment are the same, the program should print `-1 -1`.
- The condition `if s > l` and `if e >= r` are not mutually exclusive, and the program might print `-1 -1` incorrectly in some cases.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic is generally correct, but it has a potential issue with handling boundary conditions for segments that exactly match the query range.

### Conclusion:
- Given the potential issue with boundary conditions, the program is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
