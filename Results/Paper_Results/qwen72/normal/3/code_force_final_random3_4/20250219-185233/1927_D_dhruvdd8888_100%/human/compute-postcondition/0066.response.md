Postcondition: **`_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (unchanged), `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `int(input())` must be greater than 2, `l` and `r` are the integers provided by the user input, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `LA` is the length of `arr`. If `s` is 1 or `s` is greater than `r`, the variables retain their values. Otherwise, the variables also retain their values.**
