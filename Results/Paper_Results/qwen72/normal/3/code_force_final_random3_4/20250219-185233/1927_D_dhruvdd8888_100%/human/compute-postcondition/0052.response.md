Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` (incremented by 1).
2. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
3. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
4. `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
5. `l` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.
6. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
7. `LA` is the length of `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s - 1, s)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input for `l` and `r`:**
   - The user provides two integers, `l` and `r`, which are stored in the variables `l` and `r`.

2. **Determine `eli`:**
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. This means `eli` is the position in `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would fit if `arr` is sorted.

3. **Determine `LA`:**
   - `LA` is the length of `arr`.

4. **Determine `min(eli, LA)`:**
   - `min(eli, LA)` will be the smaller of the two values: `eli` or `LA`.

5. **Access Tuple at `min(eli, LA)`:**
   - The tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is accessed.
   - `s` is the first element of this tuple.
   - `e` is the second element of this tuple.
   - `_` is the third element of this tuple, incremented by 1.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The code prints `s - 1` and `s`.

### Final Output:
- The value of `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- The value of `s - 1` is one less than `s`.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, and `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`)**
