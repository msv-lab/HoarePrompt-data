Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to `nums[2]`. If `nums[2] != nums[1]`, `s` is 2, and `arr` contains an additional tuple `(3, 2, nums[1])` at the end. If `nums[1] == nums[0]` and `arr` initially contained an additional tuple `(1, 0, nums[0])` at the end, this tuple remains unchanged. If `nums[2] == nums[1]`, `s` remains 0 unless `nums[1] != nums[0]`, in which case `s` remains 1.**
