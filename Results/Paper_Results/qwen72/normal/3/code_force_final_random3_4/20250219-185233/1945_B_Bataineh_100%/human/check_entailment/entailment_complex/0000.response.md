### Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously, given the launch frequencies of two installations (`a` and `b`) and the visibility duration of each firework (`m`).

Let's break down the logic of the function:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - **If `m < a` and `m < b`:**
     - In this case, the visibility duration of a firework is less than the launch frequency of both installations. Therefore, no two fireworks from different installations will overlap in visibility. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (one from each installation).
   - **If `m < a` and `m >= b`:**
     - Here, the visibility duration is less than the launch frequency of the first installation but greater than or equal to the second installation. This means that multiple fireworks from the second installation can be visible at the same time, but only one from the first installation. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2 + m // b` (one from the first installation and `m // b` from the second installation).
   - **If `m < b` and `m >= a`:**
     - This is the reverse of the previous case. The visibility duration is less than the launch frequency of the second installation but greater than or equal to the first installation. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2 + m // a` (one from the second installation and `m // a` from the first installation).
   - **Otherwise:**
     - In all other cases, the visibility duration is greater than or equal to both launch frequencies. This means that multiple fireworks from both installations can be visible at the same time. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `m // a + m // b + 2` (one from each installation plus the additional fireworks from both installations that fit within the visibility duration).

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- The conditions are designed to handle different scenarios based on the relationship between `m`, `a`, and `b`.
- The logic for each condition is correct and aligns with the problem description.
- The final condition `else` covers all other cases, ensuring that the function handles all possible input scenarios.

### Example Verification:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `6 7 4`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: `m = 4` is less than both `a = 6` and `b = 7`, so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2.
- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `3 4 10`
  - Output: `7`
  - Reason: `m = 10` is greater than `a = 3` and `b = 4`, so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7`.
- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `7 8 56`
  - Output: `17`
  - Reason: `m = 56` is greater than both `a = 7` and `b = 8`, so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `56 // 7 + 56 // 8 + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17`.
- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `5 6 78123459896`
  - Output: `28645268630`
  - Reason: `m = 78123459896` is greater than both `a = 5` and `b = 6`, so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `78123459896 // 5 + 78123459896 // 6 + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630`.
- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - Output: `4`
  - Reason: `m = 1` is equal to both `a = 1` and `b = 1`, so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `1 // 1 + 1 // 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.
- **Example 6:**
  - Input: `1 1 1000000000000000000`
  - Output: `2000000000000000002`
  - Reason: `m = 1000000000000000000` is greater than both `a = 1` and `b = 1`, so the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `1000000000000000000 // 1 + 1000000000000000000 // 1 + 2 = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002`.

The function correctly handles all the given test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
