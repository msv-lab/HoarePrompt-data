### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice appends elements to `c` and Bob deletes elements from `a` without appending them to `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, so she will try to include as many small integers as possible.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, so he will try to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the elements from 0 to `N` (inclusive) to find the smallest integer `i` that is not present in `c` or appears less than twice.
   - The logic is based on the idea that if a number appears only once in `a`, Alice can pick it, and Bob will not be able to pick it again. If a number appears zero times, it is the MEX.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Counting Elements:**
     - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using `cnt`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `N` and checks if the count of the current number `i` is 1. If it is, it increments `t` (a counter for numbers that appear exactly once).
     - If `t` reaches 2 or the count of `i` is 0, it returns `i` as the MEX.
   - **Optimal Play:**
     - The program's logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the smallest numbers first and checking their counts.
     - If a number appears exactly once, Alice will pick it, and Bob will not be able to pick it again, ensuring that the MEX is maximized by Alice and minimized by Bob.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all numbers from 0 to `N-1` are present in `a` by returning `N` as the MEX.
   - It also handles the case where some numbers are missing by correctly identifying the smallest missing number.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - The function `func_1` reads the size `N` of the array `a` and the array itself.
  - It initializes a `defaultdict` `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.

- **Counting Elements:**
  - The loop `for i in range(N):` correctly updates the count of each element in `a`.

- **Finding the MEX:**
  - The loop `for i in range(N + 1):` iterates through all possible values from 0 to `N`.
  - If `cnt[i] == 1`, it increments `t` (a counter for numbers that appear exactly once).
  - If `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i] == 0`, it returns `i` as the MEX.
  - The loop ensures that the first number that either appears exactly once (and thus Alice can pick it) or does not appear at all (and thus is the MEX) is returned.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of `c` after both players play optimally. It correctly counts the occurrences of each element and determines the smallest integer that is not present in `c` or appears less than twice. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
