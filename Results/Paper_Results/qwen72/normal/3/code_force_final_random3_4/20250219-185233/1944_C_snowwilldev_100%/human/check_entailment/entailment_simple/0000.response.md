### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. This is a good approach to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the array.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `c`.

4. **Algorithm Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` (inclusive).
   - It checks if the count of the current integer `i` is 1. If it is, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if the count of the current integer `i` is 0, it returns `i`.
   - This logic is based on the observation that if there are two unique integers that appear exactly once, Alice and Bob can play in such a way that the MEX will be the next integer that is not in the array. If an integer `i` is not in the array at all, it will be the MEX.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are the same.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The program efficiently processes each test case in linear time, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. The use of a `defaultdict` to count occurrences and the loop to find the MEX are both appropriate and efficient.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
