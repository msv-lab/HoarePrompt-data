### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not simulate the game as described, where Alice and Bob take turns with specific goals. The function `func_1` does not consider the turn-based nature of the game or the strategic choices of the players. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each number and returns the first integer `i` that either does not appear or appears only once when two such numbers are found. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

#### Key Points:
1. **Turn-Based Game Simulation**: The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns, with Alice starting first. The program should simulate the game by alternating turns and making optimal choices for each player.
2. **Optimal Strategies**:
   - **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
3. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `c`. The program should ensure that the final array `c` reflects the optimal strategies of both players.

#### Counterexample Analysis:
The counterexample provided in the original assessment is valid:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```
- **Expected Output:** 3
- **Actual Output:** 0

**Explanation:**
- Alice can start by picking 2, resulting in `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
- Bob can then pick 0, resulting in `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
- Alice can pick 1, resulting in `a = [2]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
- Bob can pick 2, resulting in `a = []` and `c = [2, 1]`.

The MEX of `c = [2, 1]` is 3, which is the optimal score Alice can achieve. However, the program returns 0, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly simulate the game or implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
