Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrectness:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal moves for both players. The current logic in `func_1` simply counts the occurrences of each number and returns the smallest number that either does not appear or appears only once when two such numbers are found. This approach does not simulate the game as described, where Alice and Bob take turns and Alice aims to maximize the MEX while Bob aims to minimize it.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```
- **Expected Output:** 3
- **Actual Output:** 0

**Explanation:**
- Alice can start by picking 2, resulting in `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
- Bob can then pick 0, resulting in `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
- Alice can pick 1, resulting in `a = [2]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
- Bob can pick 2, resulting in `a = []` and `c = [2, 1]`.

The MEX of `c = [2, 1]` is 3, which is the optimal score Alice can achieve. However, the program returns 0, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies for both players, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
