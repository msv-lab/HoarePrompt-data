Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the array `c` that Alice and Bob construct during their game, with both players playing optimally. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategies of both players:

- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, so she will try to include as many unique elements as possible, especially those that are smaller and not yet in `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, so he will try to remove elements that Alice might need to maximize the MEX.

The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`. It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` and returns the first integer `i` that either:
- Is missing from the array (`cnt[i] == 0`), or
- Appears exactly once in the array (`cnt[i] == 1`), but only if no more than one other integer has appeared exactly once before `i`.

This approach is correct because:
1. **Optimal Strategy**: Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` and appears exactly once in `a`. Bob will try to remove the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` and appears exactly once in `a` to prevent Alice from picking it.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c`. By the time the game ends, the array `c` will contain all integers that appear more than once in `a`, and the smallest integer that appears exactly once or is missing will be the MEX.

The provided execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program. The function `func_1` reads the input, processes the array, and returns the correct MEX value based on the optimal play of both players.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
