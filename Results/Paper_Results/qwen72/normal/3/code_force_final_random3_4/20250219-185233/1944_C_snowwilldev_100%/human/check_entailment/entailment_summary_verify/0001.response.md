### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves Alice and Bob playing a game on an array `a` where Alice appends the chosen element to `c` and Bob simply removes it from `a`.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of `c` after the game ends, with both players playing optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - Alice will try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `N` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `N` to find the smallest integer `i` that either appears exactly once in `a` or is missing from `a`.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Counting Elements:**
     - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using `cnt`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `N` and checks if the count of the current number `i` is 1. If it is, it increments `t` (a counter for numbers that appear exactly once).
     - If `t` reaches 2 or the count of `i` is 0, it returns `i` as the MEX.
   - **Optimal Play:**
     - The program's logic is based on the idea that if a number appears exactly once in `a`, Alice can pick it, and Bob will not be able to pick it again. This ensures that the MEX is maximized by Alice and minimized by Bob.
     - However, the logic of returning the first integer `i` that either appears exactly once or is missing from `a` is not entirely correct. The optimal strategy for both players involves more complex decision-making.

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal play for both Alice and Bob in a more strategic manner.
   - Specifically, the program assumes that if a number appears exactly once, it will always be the MEX, which is not necessarily true. Bob can still influence the game by picking other numbers to prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.
   - The correct approach should involve simulating the game to ensure that both players are making optimal moves.

6. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the first test case `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`:
     - The program returns 2, which is correct.
   - For the second test case `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`:
     - The program returns 1, which is incorrect. The correct MEX should be 4, as all numbers from 0 to 3 are present.
   - For the third test case `a = [1, 1]`:
     - The program returns 0, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is not entirely correct for all cases. It fails to consider the optimal play for both Alice and Bob, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
