Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `best_y` is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that `gcd_val + y` is maximized, where `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop execution, and `y` is 1. `results` now contains one additional element, which is `best_y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append(best_y)` adds the value of `best_y` to the list `results`.
- `best_y` is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that `gcd_val + y` is maximized, where `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
- The initial state of `results` was a list containing `best_y`.
- After the code execution, `results` now contains one additional element, which is `best_y`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `max_sum`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
