The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and `x`. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `x - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `x - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `y` will be `x - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is `1 + (x - 1)`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `1 + (x - 1)`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
