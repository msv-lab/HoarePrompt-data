Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is `x - 1` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.**

Explanation:
- `gcd_val` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.
- The value of `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, and `y` is `x - 1`.
- Since `x` is at least 2 and `y` is `x - 1`, `y` is at least 1, ensuring that `gcd_val` is always a positive integer.
- The GCD of `x` and `y` (where `y = x - 1`) will be 1 if `x` and `y` are consecutive integers, as consecutive integers are coprime.
- All other variables and their constraints remain unchanged.
