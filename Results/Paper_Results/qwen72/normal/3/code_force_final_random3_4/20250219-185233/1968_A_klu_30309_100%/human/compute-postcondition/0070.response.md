Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `best_y = y` updates the value of `best_y` to be equal to `y`.
- Since `y` is defined as `x - 2`, `best_y` is now `x - 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
