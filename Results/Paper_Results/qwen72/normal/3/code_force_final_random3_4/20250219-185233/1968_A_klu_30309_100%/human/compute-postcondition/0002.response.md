Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is 0**. 

The variable `max_sum` has been initialized to 0. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
