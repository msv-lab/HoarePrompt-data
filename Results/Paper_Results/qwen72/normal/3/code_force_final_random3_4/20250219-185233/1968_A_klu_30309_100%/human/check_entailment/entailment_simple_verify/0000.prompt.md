You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y

    #State: `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have `t` elements, `results` is a list of length `t` where each element is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that `gcd_val + y` is maximized, where `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y` and `y` itself is maximized, for each `x` in the list `test_cases`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program contains a logical error in the loop where it calculates the maximum value of `gcd(x, y) + y`. The issue is with the `break` statement inside the loop. The `break` statement causes the loop to terminate as soon as it finds a `y` that gives a higher sum than the current `max_sum`. However, this does not guarantee that the maximum possible sum has been found, as the loop should continue to check all possible values of `y` to ensure the maximum sum is indeed found.

For example, consider the input `x = 10`. The program will start with `y = 9` and calculate `gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10`. It will then set `max_sum` to 10 and `best_y` to 9 and break out of the loop. However, the correct answer should be `y = 5` because `gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10`, which is also the maximum possible sum. The program fails to find this correct `y` because it breaks out of the loop prematurely.

To fix this, the `break` statement should be removed, allowing the loop to iterate through all possible values of `y` and find the maximum sum correctly.
