Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have `t` elements, `results` is a list of length `t` where each element is the largest integer `y` in the range from 1 to `x - 1` such that `gcd_val + y` is maximized, where `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` remains a non-negative integer within the specified range, and the list `test_cases` still contains `t` integers, each within the specified range. The list `results` now contains `t` elements, where each element corresponds to the best `y` value found for each `x` in `test_cases`. The best `y` value is the largest integer in the range from 1 to `x - 1` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` plus `y`.
