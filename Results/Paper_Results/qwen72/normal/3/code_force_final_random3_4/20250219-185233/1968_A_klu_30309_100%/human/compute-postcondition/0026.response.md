Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `y` is 1 (or the smallest value greater than 0 that the loop reaches), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + 1` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `y` set to `x - 1` and decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration until `y` reaches 1 (or the smallest value greater than 0).
- In each iteration, the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y` is calculated, and the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` (`current_sum`) is compared to `max_sum`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`, and the loop breaks.
- If no such `y` is found where `current_sum` > `max_sum`, the loop will continue until `y` reaches 1.
- After the loop completes, `y` will be 1 (or the smallest value greater than 0 that the loop reaches), and `gcd_val` and `current_sum` will be the values calculated for `y = 1`.
- `max_sum` and `best_y` will either be the values updated during the loop or remain unchanged if no update was made.
