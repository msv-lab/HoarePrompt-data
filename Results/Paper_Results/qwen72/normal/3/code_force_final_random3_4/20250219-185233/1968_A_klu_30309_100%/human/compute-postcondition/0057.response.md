Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is 0, and `best_y` is 1.**

The value of `best_y` is explicitly set to 1, which matches the initial state where `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced the maximum `max_sum`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
