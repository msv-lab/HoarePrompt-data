Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to track whether Alice or Bob will win.
   - It creates a sorted list `set_` of unique elements from `arr`.

3. **First Check**:
   - If the smallest unique element in `set_` is not 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. This is correct because if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can always choose `k` equal to the smallest pile size and win in one move.

4. **Consecutive Differences Check**:
   - The function then checks if the differences between consecutive unique elements in `set_` are all 1.
   - If any difference is greater than 1, the function breaks out of the loop and sets `not_c` to `False`.
   - The boolean variable `A` is toggled for each unique element in `set_` except the first one.

5. **Final Toggle**:
   - If `not_c` is `True` (i.e., all differences between consecutive unique elements are 1), `A` is toggled one more time.
   - The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

6. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic of toggling `A` for each unique element in `set_` is based on the idea that if the differences between consecutive unique elements are all 1, the game can be reduced to a series of moves where each player removes 1 stone from each non-empty pile. The player who starts (Alice) will lose if the number of unique elements is even, and win if the number of unique elements is odd.
   - The final toggle ensures that the result is correct for the case where all differences are 1.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the smallest pile size is not 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all pile sizes are 1 correctly, as `A` will be toggled an even number of times, resulting in `A` being `False` and Bob winning.

8. **Complexity**:
   - The program efficiently handles the constraints by using set operations and sorting, which are both within the acceptable time complexity for the given input sizes.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
