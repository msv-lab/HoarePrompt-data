### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to track the winner.
   - It creates a sorted list `set_` of unique elements from `arr`.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - If the smallest pile size (the first element in `set_`) is not 1, Alice can win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles at once. Therefore, the function returns "Alice" in this case.

4. **Consecutive Differences Check**:
   - The program then iterates through the sorted unique elements in `set_` to check if the difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than 1.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, the variable `not_c` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
   - If the difference is 1, the variable `A` is toggled (i.e., `A` becomes `True` if it was `False`, and vice versa).

5. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, if `not_c` is still `True`, it means all consecutive elements in `set_` have a difference of 1. In this case, `A` is toggled one more time.
   - Finally, the function returns "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise it returns "Bob".

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Initial Check**:
  - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which is correct.

- **Consecutive Differences Check**:
  - The loop checks if the differences between consecutive elements in `set_` are all 1. This is a key part of the logic because if the differences are all 1, the game can be reduced to a simple parity problem.
  - The variable `A` is toggled for each consecutive difference of 1, which effectively counts the number of such differences. If the number of such differences is odd, Alice wins; if it is even, Bob wins.

- **Final Check**:
  - If `not_c` is `True`, it means all differences are 1, and the final toggle of `A` is necessary to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of differences.
  - The final return statement correctly outputs "Alice" or "Bob" based on the value of `A`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description and constraints. The initial check, the consecutive differences check, and the final check all align with the optimal play strategy for both players.
