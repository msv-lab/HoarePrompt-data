Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, `is_already_stairs` is False, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`**. 

The code snippet `res.append((start_index, start_index))` adds the tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to the list `res`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged. The condition `i + 1` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` is still valid, and `j` is still equal to `i`, which is 0. The value of `is_already_stairs` remains False.
