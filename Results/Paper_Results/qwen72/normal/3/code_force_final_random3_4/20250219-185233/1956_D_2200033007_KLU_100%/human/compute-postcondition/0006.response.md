Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 1, `i + 1` must be greater than 1, `is_already_stairs` is False.**

The value of `is_already_stairs` is explicitly set to False. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged: `i` is still a non-negative integer, `j` is still 1, and the condition that `i + 1` must be greater than 1 is still valid. The state of `is_already_stairs` is now explicitly False, regardless of the previous value.
