Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `i - 1`, `i + 1` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `is_already_stairs` is False, `i` is greater than 0, and the element at index `start_index + i` in the array `arr` is not equal to `i`.**

The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, which updates the value of `j` to `i - 1`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
