### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing the MEX operation no more than 500,000 times.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - **Dynamic Programming**: It uses a dictionary `res_dict` to store results of subproblems, which is a good approach to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **Base Case**: When `start_index` equals `end_index`, the result is the maximum of 1 and the element at that index. This is incorrect because the MEX of a single element should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set, which is 0 if the element is 0, and 1 otherwise.
   - **Recursive Case**: The function tries to split the subarray at different points and computes the sum of the results of these splits plus the MEX of the split point. However, the MEX calculation is not correct. The function incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be computed by adding the length of the subarray squared, which does not align with the definition of MEX.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum possible sum for the subarray, but the logic for computing this sum is flawed.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is intended to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - **Max Value Calculation**: It first computes the maximum value using `func_1`.
   - **Base Case**: If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns a single operation if true. This is correct for a single element.
   - **Stair Pattern**: If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a specific pattern and appends the operation to the result. This logic is incorrect because the maximum value should be the sum of the elements after applying the MEX operation, not the square of the length.
   - **Recursive Splitting**: It recursively tries to find the optimal split that achieves the maximum value and constructs the operations accordingly. However, the logic for splitting and computing the MEX is flawed, as it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is intended to transform a subarray into a specific pattern where the elements form a sequence from 0 to the length of the subarray minus 1.
   - **Pattern Check**: It checks if the subarray is already in the desired pattern. If not, it recursively transforms the subarray by setting the elements to the MEX value and appending the operation to the result.
   - **MEX Transformation**: The function sets the elements to the MEX value, but it does not correctly compute the MEX. It assumes that the MEX is the length of the subarray minus 1, which is not always true.

5. **Issues and Concerns**:
   - **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation is not correctly implemented in the code. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the code does not reflect this.
   - **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` rely on global variables `arr` and `res_dict`, which are not defined in the provided code. This can lead to undefined behavior.
   - **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for computing the maximum sum and constructing the operations is incorrect. The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be computed by adding the length of the subarray squared, and `func_2` and `make_stairs` do not correctly handle the transformation to the MEX value.
   - **Recursive Depth**: The recursive depth in `func_1` and `func_2` can be very high, especially for larger subarrays, which might lead to stack overflow or excessive computation time.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the MEX calculation and the logic for maximizing the sum of the array. It also relies on undefined global variables and has potential issues with recursive depth and incorrect logic.

Final: **False**
