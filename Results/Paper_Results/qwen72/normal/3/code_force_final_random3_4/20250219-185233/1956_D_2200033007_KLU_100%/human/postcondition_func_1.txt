The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which are integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(arr). The function returns a list of tuples representing segments of the array `arr` that meet certain conditions. If the length of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` is 1 and the single element is greater than 0, it returns an empty list. If the length is 1 and the single element is less than or equal to 0, it returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. If the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and the maximum value in the subarray equals the square of the subarray's length, it returns a list containing the tuple `(start_index, end_index)`. Otherwise, it recursively divides the subarray into smaller segments and returns the combined results of these recursive calls, ensuring that the sum of the maximum values of these segments equals the maximum value of the original subarray. If no such segments are found, it returns the result of a recursive call with adjusted indices.
