The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, which means the function is executed with the argument `i - 1`. Since the function call itself does not provide any return value or change any variables directly in the given snippet, we assume that the function `make_stairs` does not return a value or modify any global variables.

The initial state variables `i`, `j`, `is_already_stairs`, and the condition about the array `arr` remain unchanged, except that the function `make_stairs` is called with `i - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `i`, `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `is_already_stairs` is False, `i` is greater than 0, the element at index `start_index + i` in the array `arr` is equal to `i`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**
