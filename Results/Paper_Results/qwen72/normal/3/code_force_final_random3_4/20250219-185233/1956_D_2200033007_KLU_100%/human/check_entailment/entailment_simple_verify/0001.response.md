### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing the MEX operation no more than 500,000 times.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - The function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results of subproblems in `res_dict`.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, where the result is the maximum of 1 and the element at that index. This is incorrect because the MEX of a single-element subarray should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the set, which is 0 if the element is 0, and 1 otherwise.
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, it tries to split the subarray at different points and computes the sum of the results of these splits plus the MEX of the split point. However, the MEX is not correctly computed.
   - The function returns the maximum possible sum for the subarray, but the MEX calculation is flawed.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It first computes the maximum value using `func_1`.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns a single operation if true. This is correct.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a specific pattern and appends the operation to the result. This is incorrect because the MEX value is not correctly computed, and the transformation logic is flawed.
   - Otherwise, it recursively tries to find the optimal split that achieves the maximum value and constructs the operations accordingly. This is also flawed due to the incorrect MEX calculation.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a specific pattern where the elements form a sequence from 0 to the length of the subarray minus 1.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired pattern.
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray by setting the elements to the MEX value and appending the operation to the result. However, the logic for transforming the subarray is incorrect and does not align with the MEX definition.

5. **Issues and Concerns**:
   - **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation is not explicitly defined in the code. The function `func_1` and `func_2` assume that the MEX value is computed, but there is no function or method to compute the MEX of a subarray.
   - **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` rely on global variables `arr` and `res_dict`, which are defined in the main program. However, the use of global variables can lead to side effects and make the code harder to understand and maintain.
   - **Incorrect MEX Logic**: The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` for computing the MEX and the maximum sum is not correct. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the code does not reflect this.
   - **Recursive Depth**: The recursive depth in `func_1` and `func_2` can be very high, especially for larger subarrays, which might lead to stack overflow or excessive computation time.
   - **Stair Construction**: The `make_stairs` function is intended to construct a specific pattern, but it does not correctly handle the transformation of the subarray to the MEX value.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the MEX calculation and the logic for maximizing the sum of the array. It also relies on undefined global variables and has potential issues with recursive depth and incorrect logic.

Correctness: **False**
