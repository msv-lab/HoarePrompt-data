Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `i`, `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `i` is greater than 0. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, `start_index` is a valid index for the array `arr`, `j` is `start_index + i - 1`, `arr[j]` is equal to `i - 1` for all `j` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` inclusive, and `res` has a new tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)` appended to it.***
