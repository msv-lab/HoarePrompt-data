Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `i`, and `i + 1` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`. If any element at index `start_index + j` in the array `arr` is not equal to `j` for `j` in the range from 0 to `i`, `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` retains its value as `True`. Additionally, `is_already_stairs` is False.**
