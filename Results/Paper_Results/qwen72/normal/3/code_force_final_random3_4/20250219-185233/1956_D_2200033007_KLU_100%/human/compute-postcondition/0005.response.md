The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `i + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a non-negative integer, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `i + 1` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 1, `i + 1` must be greater than 1. If the element at index `start_index + j` in the array `arr` is not equal to 0, `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` retains its previous value.**
