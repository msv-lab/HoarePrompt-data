The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `start_index`, and the value of `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `start_index` is a valid index for the array `arr`.
- `j` is `start_index + 1`.
- `arr[j]` is equal to `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `start_index + 2`.
- `start_index` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `start_index + i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is greater than 0, `start_index` is a valid index for the array `arr`, `j` is `start_index + 2`, `arr[j]` is equal to `i`**
