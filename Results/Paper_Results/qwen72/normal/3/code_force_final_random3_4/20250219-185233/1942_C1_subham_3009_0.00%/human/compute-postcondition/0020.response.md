Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the last input, `x` is the second integer from the last input, `y` is the third integer from the last input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `arr` is a list of `x` integers converted from the first `x` strings in the original `arr`, the program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are set to the values from the last input provided during the last iteration of the loop. The list `chosen_vertices` contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen for the last test case. The list `arr` contains `x` integers, each converted from the corresponding string in the input for the last test case. The program is still running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable remains set to `'__main__'`.
