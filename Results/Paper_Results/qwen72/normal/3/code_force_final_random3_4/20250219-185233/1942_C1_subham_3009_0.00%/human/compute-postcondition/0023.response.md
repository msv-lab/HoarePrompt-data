Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` integers. It then prints `x - 2` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain the values from the last test case, and `arr` is a list of `x` integers converted from the input. The function does not modify the `chosen_vertices` list, and it only operates if the program is running as the main module. **
