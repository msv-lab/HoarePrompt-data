Output State: **`t` is `t - 2` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `arr` is a list of `x` integers where each integer is the result of converting the corresponding string from the initial `arr` list to an integer, the program is currently running as the main module, and the `__name__` variable is set to `'__main__'`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the first, second, and third integers from the input, respectively.
- The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, still `t - 2` and must be greater than 0.
- The initial state of `chosen_vertices` and `arr` remains unchanged.
- The program is still running as the main module, and `__name__` is still set to `'__main__'`.
