The loop head contains the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `t` must be such that it is at least 1, as it is the number of test cases and the loop will run `t` times.

State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
