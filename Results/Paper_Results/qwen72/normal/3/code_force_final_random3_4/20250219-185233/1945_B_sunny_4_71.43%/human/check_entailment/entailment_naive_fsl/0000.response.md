Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem of finding the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m + 1` minutes, but it does not account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched from both installations.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6 7 4
```
The program will output:
```
2
```
However, the correct output should be `2` because the fireworks launched at times 6 and 7 will be visible at the same time for one minute (from minute 7 to minute 8).

The program fails to consider the overlap of visibility periods, which is crucial for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
