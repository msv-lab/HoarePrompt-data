Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

    2000000000000000002
    
Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters a, b, and m, where a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it should also take an integer t as the first parameter, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        
        print(A + B)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable that has been incremented by `t` times, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input for each test case, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1` for each test case, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1` for each test case, and the loop has printed `A + B` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from user input. It then calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` as `int(m / b) + 1` for each test case, and prints the sum `A + B`. After all test cases are processed, the function does not return any value, but the user will have seen the sum `A + B` printed for each test case.
