Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable incremented by 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the user input, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `A = int(m / a) + 1` is already part of the initial state, and it does not change any values or states that are not already defined. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
