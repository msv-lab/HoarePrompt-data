The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `s`. The loop can execute again if there is another integer in the list `s` to be assigned to `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer, and `i` is the first integer in the list `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least two integers, and `i` will be the second integer in the list `s`.

State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `t` is 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros with the element at index -1 incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least two integers, `r` is 'z', `i` is the second integer in the list `s`, `x` is -1**
