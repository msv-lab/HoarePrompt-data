The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than the current value of `_`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `_` is a placeholder variable that has been incremented by 1 for each iteration. Since the loop has already executed once, `_` must have been incremented to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented to 2, and `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 2**
