The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a placeholder variable and not used in the loop body, it does not retain any meaningful state between iterations. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than the current iteration count.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `_` is a placeholder variable. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than the current iteration count. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next iteration will increment `_` by 1, but we don't need to explicitly state the value of `_` because it is a placeholder.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1 greater than the current iteration count, which means `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, and `func_2()` has been called.** 

However, to be more precise about the state at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, and `func_2()` has been called.** 

Since `_` is a placeholder, its value is not tracked, and `t` remains the same. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
