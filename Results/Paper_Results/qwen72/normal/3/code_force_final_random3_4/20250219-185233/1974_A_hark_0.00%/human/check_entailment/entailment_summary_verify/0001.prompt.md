You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. It then calls the function `func_2` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `t` remains a non-negative integer within the specified range, and `func_2` has been executed `t` times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This is because each screen can fit up to 2 2x2 icons (since 2 * 4 = 8 cells, which is less than 15 cells).
     - `x` is then adjusted by subtracting the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons that can fit on the screens. The formula used is `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This is incorrect because it should be `x - bxsfory * 4 + y * 4`.
     - `bxsfory1` is calculated as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15, plus 1 if `x` is greater than 0. This is also incorrect because it should not add 1 if `x` is greater than 0.
     - The total number of screens is then printed as `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - The number of screens required is simply the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is correct.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - The number of screens required is the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is correct.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - The number of screens required is 0, which is correct.

3. **Function 3 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - **Loop Through Test Cases**: It loops `t` times and calls `func_2()` for each test case.
   - **Output**: The output for each test case is handled correctly by `func_2()`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation in Case 1**:
  - The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x - bxsfory * 4` to correctly account for the cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
  - The formula `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is also incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` without the additional `+ 1`.

### Corrected Function 2:
```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors in the calculation for the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
