The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. However, the context suggests that there might be an implicit or external constraint that `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since the function signature does not include any parameters, we can only describe the output based on the provided context.

Given the output section is empty, it implies that the function does not return any specific value based on the input `t`. However, without more information, we cannot determine what the function does internally or what it returns. If we assume that the function is supposed to return something based on `t`, we would need more details to accurately describe the functionality.

Since the task is to describe the functionality based on the provided information, and the output section is empty, we can only state that the function does not return any value based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value based on the provided information.**
