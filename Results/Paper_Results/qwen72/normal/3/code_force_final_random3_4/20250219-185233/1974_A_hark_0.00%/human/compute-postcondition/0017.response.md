The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, the output is dependent on the values of `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. Since the function does not accept any parameters, the values of `x` and `y` must be defined within the function or are global variables. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `x` and `y`, but the specific return values are not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a value based on the relationship between two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99), but the specific return values are not specified.**
