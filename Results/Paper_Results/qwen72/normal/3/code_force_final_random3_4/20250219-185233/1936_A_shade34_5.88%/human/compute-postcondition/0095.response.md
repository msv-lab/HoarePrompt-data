To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop initializes `i` to 0 and iterates up to `n-1`. The initial state provided is `i` is `n-1`, which is incorrect for the loop to start. The loop expects `i` to start from 0.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is an input integer greater than 0. The initial state provided is `n` is an input integer greater than 0, which is correct and does not need adjustment.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` starts from 0, and `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**
