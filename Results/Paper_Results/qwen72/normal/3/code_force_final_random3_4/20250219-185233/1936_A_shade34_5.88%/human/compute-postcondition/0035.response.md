Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `_` has completed its iterations, which means the loop or process that `_` represents has finished.
   - `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list.
   - `s` is the user input string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mak2` is again equal to `mak`.

4. **Output:**
   - The first element printed is the string `?`.
   - The second element printed is the value of `mak`.
   - The third element printed is the value of `mak2`, which is the same as `mak`.
   - The fourth element printed is the value of `i`, which is 1.
   - The fifth element printed is the value of `mak2`, which is the same as `mak`.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
```
?, mak, mak, 1, mak
```
where `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given.

Output: **?, mak, mak, 1, mak (where mak is the highest value of i for which the user input was `<` or 0 if no such input was given)**
