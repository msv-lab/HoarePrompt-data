To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to start and continue.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `pans` is a list containing the indices for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `pans`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `len(pans)` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, len(pans))` will generate a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `len(pans) - 1`. If `len(pans)` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The loop will start with `i` being 1, not `n-1`. The initial value of `i` is set by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust it.
- **`pans`**: For the loop to execute, `pans` must have at least 2 elements. This ensures that `len(pans)` is greater than 1, allowing the loop to run.

### Final State:
- `i` is 1 (set by the loop)
- `pans` must have at least 2 elements
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `mak` is 0 (unchanged)
- `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<` (unchanged)

### State:
**`i` is 1, `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`**
