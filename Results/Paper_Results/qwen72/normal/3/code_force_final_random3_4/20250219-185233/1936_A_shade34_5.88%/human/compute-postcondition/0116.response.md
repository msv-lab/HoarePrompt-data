The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is the input string provided by the user. If `s` is '<', `mak` is 1 and `pans` is a list containing the value 1. If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing the value 1. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.**
