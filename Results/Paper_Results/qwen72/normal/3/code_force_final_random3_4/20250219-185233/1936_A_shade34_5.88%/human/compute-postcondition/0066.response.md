Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` is a list that must have at least 4 elements.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the user input is a string that equals `">"`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the value of `mak`:**
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input. If the user input is `">"`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged, which means it is 0 (assuming `mak` is initialized to 0 or not defined before this point).

4. **Determine the values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`:**
   - `pans[mak]` will be either `pans[0]` or `pans[1]` depending on the value of `mak`.
   - `pans[i]` will be `pans[3]` because `i` is 3.

5. **Construct the output:**
   - The `print` statement will output a string that includes the values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:

- If the user input is `">"`, `mak` is 1, so the output will be:
  ```python
  print('?', pans[1], pans[1], pans[3], pans[3])
  ```
  Output: **? [pans[1]] [pans[1]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where pans[1] is the second element of the list `pans` and pans[3] is the fourth element of the list `pans`)**

- If the user input is not `">"`, `mak` remains 0, so the output will be:
  ```python
  print('?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[3], pans[3])
  ```
  Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the list `pans` and pans[3] is the fourth element of the list `pans`)**

Since the user input is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both cases. However, the format requires a single output. Therefore, we will provide the most precise description possible:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where `mak` is 1 if the user input is `">"`, otherwise `mak` is 0, and `pans[3]` is the fourth element of the list `pans`)**
