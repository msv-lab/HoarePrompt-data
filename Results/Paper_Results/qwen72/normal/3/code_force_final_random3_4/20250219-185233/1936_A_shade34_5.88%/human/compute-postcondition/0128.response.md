Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement starts with a string `'? '`.
   - It then prints `pans[mak]` twice.
   - It then prints `pans[i]` twice.

4. **Values of Variables:**
   - `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
   - `i` is 1, so `pans[i]` is `pans[1]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `'? '`, followed by the value of `pans[0]` twice, and then the value of `pans[1]` twice.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the list `pans` and [pans[1]] is the second element of the list `pans`)**
