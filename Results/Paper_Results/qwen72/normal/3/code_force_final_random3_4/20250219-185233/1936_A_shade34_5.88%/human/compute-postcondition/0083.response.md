Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements (this is a tautology and doesn't provide new information).
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this doesn't affect the print statement directly).
   - If the user input is a string that is equal to `<`, `mak` is 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first element in the print statement is the string `'?'`.
   - The second and third elements are `mak`. Based on the initial state, `mak` will be 1 if the user input is `<`, and 0 otherwise.
   - The fourth and fifth elements are `i`. Based on the initial state, `i` is 2.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`.
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, then `mak` remains 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 2`.

Since the user input is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both cases.

**Final Output:**
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 1 if the user input is `<`, and 0 otherwise)**
