Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. If the user input is `'>`', `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
