Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is the loop control variable (its value is not relevant for this print statement).
   - `n` is greater than 2 (its exact value is not needed for this print statement).
   - `i` is 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is a system state and does not affect the print statement directly).
   - If the user input is a string that equals `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first element in the print statement is a string `'? '`.
   - The second and third elements are the value of `mak`, which depends on the user input.
   - The fourth and fifth elements are the value of `i`, which is explicitly given as 2.

4. **User Input:**
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 1.
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, then `mak` remains 0.

5. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is `<`, the print statement will output `? 1 1 2 2`.
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, the print statement will output `? 0 0 2 2`.

Since the user input is not specified, we need to consider both cases. However, the task is to determine what will be printed based on the given precondition. The precondition states that if the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 1, otherwise it remains 0. Therefore, we need to provide the output for both scenarios.

Output: **? 1 1 2 2 (if user input is `<`) or ? 0 0 2 2 (if user input is anything other than `<`)**
