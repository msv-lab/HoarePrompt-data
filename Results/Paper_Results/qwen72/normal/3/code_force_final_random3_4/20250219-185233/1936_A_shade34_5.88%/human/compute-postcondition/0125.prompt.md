Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0. `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. If `s` is not `<`, `pans` is an empty list unless `s` is `=`, in which case `pans` is a list containing `[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again, `s` is the input string provided by the user. If `s` is '<', `mak` is 1 and `pans` is a list containing the value 1. If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing the value 1. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `s` is the input string provided by the user. If `s` is '<', `mak` is 2 and `pans` is a list containing the value 2. If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing the value 2. Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing the value 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
