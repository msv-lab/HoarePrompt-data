Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `mak` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means any data that was waiting to be written to the standard output (like the console) is immediately written. This does not change the values of any variables, so the initial state remains unchanged except for the state of the output buffer.
