Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **`pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<` and must have at least 2 elements.**
   - This means `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements. The elements in `pans` are indices where the user input was either `=` or `<`.

2. **`i` is `len(pans) - 1`**
   - `i` is the index of the last element in the `pans` list. Since `pans` has at least 2 elements, `i` will be at least 1.

3. **`n` is greater than `len(pans)`**
   - `n` is an integer that is greater than the length of `pans`.

4. **`mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`**
   - `mak2` is the highest index in the `pans` list where the user input was `<`.

5. **`mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>` or remains 0 if no such input was received.**
   - `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` where the user input was `>`. If no such input was received, `mak` remains 0.

6. **The output buffer has been flushed**
   - This means that any previous output has been processed and is not affecting the current print statement.

Now, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```
print('!', mak2, mak)
```

- The `print` statement will output the string `'!'`, followed by the value of `mak2`, and then the value of `mak`.

### Values of Variables:
- **`mak2`**: This is the highest index in the `pans` list where the user input was `<`.
- **`mak`**: This is the index of the last element in `pans` where the user input was `>`. If no such input was received, `mak` remains 0.

### Output:
- The output will be a string starting with `'!'`, followed by the value of `mak2`, and then the value of `mak`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `mak2` and `mak` from the initial state, we can only describe them based on the given conditions.

Output: **! [mak2] [mak] (where [mak2] is the highest index in the `pans` list for which the user input was `<` and [mak] is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>` or 0 if no such input was received)**
