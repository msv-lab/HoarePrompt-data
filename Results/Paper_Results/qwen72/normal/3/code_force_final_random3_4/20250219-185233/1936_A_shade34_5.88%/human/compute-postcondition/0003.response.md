The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` generates a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given that `n` is an input integer greater than 0, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 1, as specified by the range function.

The variable `mak` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, it is mentioned in the state, so we will include it in the final state description.

State: **`_` is the loop control variable, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0, `i` is 1**
