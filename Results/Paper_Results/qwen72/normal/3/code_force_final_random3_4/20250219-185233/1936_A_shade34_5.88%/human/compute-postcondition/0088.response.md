Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `pans` is a list with at least `len(pans)` elements.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the user input is a string equal to `<`, `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` is 0.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is `<`, the value of `mak` will be 2.
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, the value of `mak` will be 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If the user input is `<`:
     ```python
     print('?', 2, 2, 3, 3)
     ```
     Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`:
     ```python
     print('?', 0, 0, 3, 3)
     ```
     Output: **? 0 0 3 3**

Since the user input is not specified, we need to consider both cases. However, based on the precondition, we can only provide the most precise description possible.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is 2 if the user input is `<`, otherwise [mak] is 0)**
