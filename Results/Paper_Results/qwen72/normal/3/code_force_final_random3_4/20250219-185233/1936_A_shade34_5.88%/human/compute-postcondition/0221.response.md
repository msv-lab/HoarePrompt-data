Functionality: ** The function `func` operates in an interactive environment with a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. It makes at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation. The function finds and outputs a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized, and 0 ≤ i, j < n. After the function concludes, the output buffer is flushed, and the indices (i, j) are printed. The function does not return any value. **
