Output State: **`i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<` and must have at least 3 elements, `n` is greater than `len(pans)`, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, the output buffer has been flushed, if the user input is `>`, `mak` is 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command has been executed, ensuring that the output buffer has been flushed. No other variables or conditions have been affected by this command, so the initial state remains unchanged except for the confirmation that the output buffer has been flushed.
