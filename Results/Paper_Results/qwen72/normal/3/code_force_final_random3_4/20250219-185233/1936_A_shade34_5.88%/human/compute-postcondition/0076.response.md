The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, as `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute. The initial state of `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` must be set to 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `mak` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed**
