### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem asks for the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after the array has been rearranged.
   - The beauty of the array is given by the formula: \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The maximum difference between any two elements in the array is \((\max(a_i) - \min(a_i))\).
   - If we sort the array in ascending order, the differences will be minimized, and if we sort it in descending order, the differences will be maximized.
   - However, the problem can be simplified by recognizing that the maximum beauty is achieved when the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other, and the rest of the elements are arranged in any order.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(l\) and the elements of the array \(nums\).
   - It initializes two variables \(x\) and \(y\) to track the maximum and minimum elements in the array, respectively.
   - It iterates through the array to update \(x\) and \(y\) with the maximum and minimum values found.
   - Finally, it prints the difference \(x - y\).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements in the array.
   - The maximum beauty of the array is indeed the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, as this difference will be the largest possible difference that can be achieved by rearranging the elements.
   - The program does not need to sort the array or perform any additional operations to achieve the maximum beauty.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem. It efficiently computes the maximum beauty of the array by finding the maximum and minimum elements and printing their difference.

Correctness: **True**
