Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using the MEX operation. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to compute the maximum possible sum for a subarray, but it does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray and apply it to the elements of the subarray. Instead, it seems to be calculating a different value that does not correspond to the MEX operation as described in the problem statement. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the program does not correctly handle this case because it does not compute the MEX of the subarrays and apply it to the elements of the subarrays. The logic in `func_1` and `make_stairs` does not align with the problem's requirements, leading to incorrect results.
