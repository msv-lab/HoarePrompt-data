Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` is not equal to its index relative to `start_index`, and `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is equal to `i - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, which reduces the value of `i` by 1.
- The value of `i` is now `i - 1`.
- The condition `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1` is updated to `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i` because `i` has been reduced by 1.
- The condition `is_already_stairs` is still False because the function call does not change the fact that at least one element in `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` is not equal to its index relative to `start_index`.
- The element at `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is now equal to `i - 1`, as the function call would have modified this element to match the new value of `i`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
