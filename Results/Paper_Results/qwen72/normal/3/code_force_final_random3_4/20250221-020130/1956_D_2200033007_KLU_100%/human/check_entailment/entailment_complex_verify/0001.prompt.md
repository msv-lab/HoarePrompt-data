You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, and operates on a list of integers `arr`. It returns a list of tuples based on the following conditions:
1. If the length of the sublist `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` is 1 and the single element is greater than 0, it returns an empty list.
2. If the length of the sublist `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` is 1 and the single element is less than or equal to 0, it returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`.
3. If the maximum value in the sublist `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` is equal to the square of the length of the sublist, it returns a list containing the tuple `(start_index, end_index)`.
4. If the sum of the element at `start_index` and the result of `func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` equals the maximum value in the sublist, it returns the result of `func_2(start_index + 1, end_index)`.
5. If the sum of the element at `end_index` and the result of `func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` equals the maximum value in the sublist, it returns the result of `func_2(start_index, end_index - 1)`.
6. If none of the above conditions are met, it recursively splits the sublist and checks for the condition `temp_res == max_value` within the loop, returning the combined results of `func_2(start_index, i - 1)` and `func_2(i + 1, end_index)` if the condition is met. If the loop completes without meeting the condition, the function will not return a value, which is an error in the provided code.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation that sets a subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX of that subarray, up to 5 × 10^5 times.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array and output the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - For a subarray `a[l:r]`, the MEX can be calculated by finding the smallest integer from 0 to `r - l + 1` that is not in the subarray.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
   - `func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the maximum possible sum for a subarray `a[start_index:end_index]`.
   - `func_2` is a recursive function that constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the maximum sum for a subarray `a[start_index:end_index]`.
   - It uses memoization to store results of subproblems in `res_dict`.
   - If the subarray has only one element, it returns the maximum of 1 and that element.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, it tries to split the subarray at different points and calculates the sum of the MEX of the subarrays plus the element at the split point.
   - It also considers the cases where the MEX is applied to the entire subarray.

5. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It first calculates the maximum value for the subarray using `func_1`.
   - If the subarray has only one element, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - For larger subarrays, it tries to find the optimal split point and recursively constructs the operations for the subarrays.

6. **Function 3 (`make_stairs`)**:
   - This function is responsible for transforming a subarray into a "staircase" pattern where the elements are set to their indices.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase pattern.
   - If not, it recursively sets the elements to the MEX of the subarray.

7. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly uses dynamic programming to find the maximum sum.
   - However, the `make_stairs` function is not correctly implemented for the MEX operation.
   - The MEX calculation is missing, and the function assumes a specific pattern (staircase) which is not always the optimal solution.
   - The `make_stairs` function should calculate the MEX of the subarray and set the subarray to that MEX value.

### Correctness:
**False**

The `make_stairs` function is not correctly implementing the MEX operation, and the program does not handle the MEX calculation properly. The program needs to be revised to correctly calculate the MEX of subarrays and apply the operations accordingly.
