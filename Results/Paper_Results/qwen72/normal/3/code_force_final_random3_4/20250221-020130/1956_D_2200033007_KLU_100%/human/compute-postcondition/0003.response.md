Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (l, r) representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`, and `is_already_stairs` is True, indicating that all elements in `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` are equal to their index relative to `start_index`.**
