### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation that sets a subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX of that subarray, up to 5 × 10^5 times.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array and output the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - For a subarray `a[l:r]`, the MEX can be calculated by finding the smallest integer from 0 to `r - l + 1` that is not in the subarray.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
   - `func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the maximum possible sum for a subarray `a[start_index:end_index]`.
   - `func_2` is a recursive function that constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the maximum sum for a subarray `a[start_index:end_index]`.
   - It uses memoization to store results of subproblems in `res_dict`.
   - If the subarray has only one element, it returns the maximum of 1 and that element.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, it tries to split the subarray at different points and calculates the sum of the MEX of the subarrays plus the element at the split point.
   - It also considers the cases where the MEX is applied to the entire subarray.

5. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It first calculates the maximum value for the subarray using `func_1`.
   - If the subarray has only one element, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - For larger subarrays, it tries to find the optimal split point and recursively constructs the operations for the subarrays.

6. **Function 3 (`make_stairs`)**:
   - This function is responsible for transforming a subarray into a "staircase" pattern where the elements are set to their indices.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase pattern.
   - If not, it recursively sets the elements to the MEX of the subarray.

7. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly uses dynamic programming to find the maximum sum.
   - However, the `make_stairs` function is not correctly implemented for the MEX operation.
   - The MEX calculation is missing, and the function assumes a specific pattern (staircase) which is not always the optimal solution.
   - The `make_stairs` function should calculate the MEX of the subarray and set the subarray to that MEX value.

### Correctness:
**False**

The `make_stairs` function is not correctly implementing the MEX operation, and the program does not handle the MEX calculation properly. The program needs to be revised to correctly calculate the MEX of subarrays and apply the operations accordingly.
