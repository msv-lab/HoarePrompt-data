The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`. `i` is a non-negative integer. Additionally, there are constraints on `start_index` such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, where `arr` is a list of integers, and `res` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(l, r)` representing the range of indices to be modified in `arr`.

The function returns `None` in both cases, which suggests that the function might be performing some operations on the input parameters but does not return any value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs operations on a list `arr` and a list of tuples `res`, but it does not return any value.**
