### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that set a range of elements to the MEX of that range.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operations should be performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function is designed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the elements in the array `arr` for the range `[start_index, end_index]`.
     - It uses dynamic programming with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
     - For a single element, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element itself.
     - For a range, it calculates the maximum sum by considering different splits and the MEX of the entire range.
     - The function returns the maximum sum for the given range.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function is designed to generate the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
     - It checks if the length of the sublist is 1 and returns the appropriate result.
     - It checks if the maximum value is equal to the square of the length of the sublist, which would indicate that the entire range can be set to the MEX.
     - It recursively splits the range to find the optimal operations.

   - **`make_stairs`**:
     - This function is designed to modify the array `arr` to form a "staircase" pattern, where the elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to `i`.
     - It ensures that the elements in the specified range are set to the MEX value and appends the corresponding operation to the `res` list.

3. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - The function correctly calculates the maximum sum for a given range using dynamic programming.
     - It handles the base case (single element) and the recursive case (splitting the range) appropriately.
     - The memoization ensures that the function is efficient and avoids redundant calculations.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - The function correctly generates the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.
     - It handles the base case (single element) and the recursive case (splitting the range) appropriately.
     - However, there is a potential issue in the function: if none of the conditions in the loop are met, the function will not return a value, which is an error. This should be fixed by ensuring a return value in all cases.

   - **`make_stairs`**:
     - The function correctly modifies the array to form a "staircase" pattern and appends the operations to the `res` list.
     - It ensures that the elements in the specified range are set to the MEX value.
     - The function does not return any value, which is consistent with its purpose.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - **`func_2`**:
     - The function should ensure that it always returns a value, even if none of the conditions in the loop are met. This can be fixed by adding a default return statement at the end of the function.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct, but there is a potential issue in `func_2` where it might not return a value in some cases. This can be fixed by adding a default return statement. Therefore, the current program is **not** fully correct.

### Correctness: **False**
