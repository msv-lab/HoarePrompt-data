### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation that sets a subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array and provide a sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray `a[start_index:end_index]` using dynamic programming.
   - The function uses a dictionary `res_dict` to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the function returns the maximum of 1 and the value at that index.
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, the function considers different ways to split the subarray and computes the MEX for each split.
   - The function then returns the maximum sum found among all possible splits.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**:
   - This function is designed to construct the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.
   - It first computes the maximum value using `func_1`.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the value is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - Otherwise, it recursively finds the optimal split that achieves the maximum value and constructs the operations accordingly.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is designed to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form (i.e., `a[start_index + j] == j` for all `j`).
   - If the subarray is not in the desired form, it recursively transforms the subarray by setting the values to the MEX of the subarray.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program uses a combination of dynamic programming and recursive construction to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` ensures that the maximum sum is computed efficiently.
   - The recursive construction in `func_2` and `make_stairs` ensures that the operations are correctly generated to achieve the maximum sum.

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 18 and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) appropriately.
   - The number of operations is limited to 5 * 10^5, which is sufficient for the given constraints.

7. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function `make_stairs` does not use the `i` parameter correctly. It should be passed the length of the subarray, but it is not clear how `start_index` is being used globally.
   - The function `make_stairs` should be called with the correct parameters to ensure it operates on the correct subarray.
   - The `res` list should be initialized and used correctly to store the operations.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the `make_stairs` function and the potential misuse of global variables, the program is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness: False**
