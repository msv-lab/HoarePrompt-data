Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program is almost correct, but there is a minor issue with the output for the "STAIR" condition. According to the problem description, the output should be "STAIR" (without the 'S' at the end), but the program outputs "STAIRS". This discrepancy will cause the program to produce incorrect output for the "STAIR" cases.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly output "STAIR" for the stair condition and will meet the requirements of the problem description.
