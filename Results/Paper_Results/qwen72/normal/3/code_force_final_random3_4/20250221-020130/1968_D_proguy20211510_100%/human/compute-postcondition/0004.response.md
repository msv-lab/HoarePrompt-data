To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `MOD` is 1000000007
- `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- `YES` is 'YES'
- `NO` is 'NO'

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The loop runs `int(input())` times, where each iteration reads four inputs: `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads two lists of integers: `p` and `a`.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - For `pb` and `ps`, the loop calculates the paths in the arrays `p` and `a` until a cycle is detected.

3. **Result Calculation:**
   - For each path, the loop calculates the maximum possible score (`resb` for `pb` and `ress` for `ps`) based on the values in `a` and the number of steps `k`.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The loop compares the scores `resb` and `ress` and prints 'Bodya' if `resb` is greater, 'Sasha' if `ress` is greater, and 'Draw' if they are equal.

### Variables Affected by the Loop:
- `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` (read from input)
- `p`, `a` (read from input)
- `pathb`, `paths` (lists created and modified)
- `vis` (list created and modified)
- `resb`, `ress` (integers calculated)
- `preb`, `pres` (integers calculated)

### Variables Not Affected by the Loop:
- `MOD`
- `alpha`
- `YES`
- `NO`

### Output State:
After the loop finishes executing all iterations, the variables `MOD`, `alpha`, `YES`, and `NO` remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, and `pres` will have their final values based on the last iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'.**
