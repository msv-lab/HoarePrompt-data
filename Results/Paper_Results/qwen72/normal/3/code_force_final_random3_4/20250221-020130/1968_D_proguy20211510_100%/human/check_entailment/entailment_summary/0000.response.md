### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly parses the input for each test case, including the number of elements `n`, the number of turns `k`, and the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha (`pb` and `ps`).
   - It initializes the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the path for each player by following the permutation `p` starting from their respective positions. It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The path for each player is stored in `pathb` and `paths` lists, which contain the scores (`a` values) at each step of the path.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function then calculates the maximum possible score for each player within `k` turns. It does this by iterating through the path and considering the score at each step.
   - The score calculation is done by summing the scores up to the current step and multiplying the last score by the remaining number of turns. This is a correct approach because it maximizes the score by considering the best possible move at each step.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the scores, the function compares the results and prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `k` is less than the number of steps in the path, which is correctly managed by breaking the loop when `k < i + 1`.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The function is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it only iterates through the paths up to `k` steps, and the paths are calculated in linear time relative to the length of the permutation.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the permutation game as described in the problem statement. It handles the input, path calculation, score calculation, and comparison correctly, and it prints the appropriate result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
