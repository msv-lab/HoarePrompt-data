The function operates in an interactive environment to find and print two indices `mak2` and `mak` from a permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} that maximize the bitwise XOR operation `p_i ⊕ p_j`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to achieve this. For each provided permutation, the function updates and uses internal variables to determine the indices and prints them in the format `! mak2 mak`. The function repeats this process for the number of test cases specified by the initial input.
