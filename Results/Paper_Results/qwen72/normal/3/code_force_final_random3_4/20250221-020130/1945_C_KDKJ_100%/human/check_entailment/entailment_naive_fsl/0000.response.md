Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position to lay the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones for the given sequence `a`. This is done using the list `S`, where `S[i]` contains the number of zeros and ones up to the i-th house. This allows for efficient computation of the number of zeros and ones on both sides of any potential road position.

3. **Condition Checking**: For each potential road position `i` (from 0 to n), the program checks if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the left side's length and if the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the right side's length. This is done using the conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum`.

4. **Optimal Position Selection**: The program keeps track of the optimal position `ans` that minimizes the absolute difference `abs(n / 2 - i)`. If multiple positions have the same minimum difference, it selects the smaller one. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to find the position that is as close to the middle of the village as possible.

5. **Output**: The program prints the optimal position for each test case, which is the required output format.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, and it correctly follows the logic to find the optimal road position. Therefore, the program is correct.
