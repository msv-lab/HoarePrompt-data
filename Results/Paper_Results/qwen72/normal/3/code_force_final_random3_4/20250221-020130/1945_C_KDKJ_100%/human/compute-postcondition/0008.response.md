Output State: **`n` is the same input integer, `a` is the same string consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is the same list containing sublists where each sublist represents the cumulative count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a` up to that point, and `ans` is the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`.**
