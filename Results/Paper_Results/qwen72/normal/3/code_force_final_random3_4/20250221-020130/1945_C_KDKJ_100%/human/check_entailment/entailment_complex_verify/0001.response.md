### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - This part is correctly implemented in `func_2` and `func_1`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of zeros and ones in the string `a` and stores them in the list `S`.
   - `S[i][0]` represents the number of zeros from the start of the string up to the i-th house.
   - `S[i][1]` represents the number of ones from the start of the string up to the i-th house.
   - This part is correctly implemented in `func_1` with the loop that appends the cumulative counts to `S`.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road can be built (from 0 to `n`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: the number of zeros on the left side of the road.
     - `lsum`: the total number of houses on the left side of the road.
     - `right`: the number of ones on the right side of the road.
     - `rsum`: the total number of houses on the right side of the road.
   - It checks if the number of zeros on the left side is at least half of the total houses on the left side (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
   - It checks if the number of ones on the right side is at least half of the total houses on the right side (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - This part is correctly implemented in `func_1` with the nested loop and conditions.

4. **Optimal Position Selection**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` to the current position `i` if `i` is closer to the middle of the village (`n / 2`) than the previously stored answer.
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `-1` to ensure it gets updated on the first valid position.
   - This part is correctly implemented in `func_1` with the `elif` condition and the update of `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the optimal position `ans` for each test case.
   - This part is correctly implemented in `func_1` with the final `print(ans)` statement.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the road can be built before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`).
   - The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` ensure that the road is not built in an invalid position.
   - This part is correctly implemented in `func_1`.

### Verification of Annotated Code:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The prefix sum list `S` is built correctly, and the conditions for checking the validity of each position `i` are accurate.
- The update of `ans` is done correctly to ensure the optimal position is selected.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all the edge cases and ensures the optimal position is selected based on the given conditions. The annotations and the original assessment align with the correct behavior of the program.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
