The loop head involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used within the loop body. The input must be a valid integer to ensure the loop can run without errors.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
