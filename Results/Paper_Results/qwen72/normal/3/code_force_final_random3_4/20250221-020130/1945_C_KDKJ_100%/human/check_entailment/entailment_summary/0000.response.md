### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
   - **Cumulative Counts:** It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores these counts in a list `S`. Each element `S[i]` contains two values: the number of '0's and the number of '1's up to the i-th house.
   - **Condition Checking:** The function then iterates over all possible positions `i` (0 ≤ i ≤ n) to check if the road can be laid after the i-th house. For each position, it checks:
     - If the number of '0's on the left side (up to index `i`) is at least half the length of the left side.
     - If the number of '1's on the right side (from index `i` to the end) is at least half the length of the right side.
   - **Optimal Position:** If both conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` to the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`. If no such position is found, it prints `-1`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** The function reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - **Test Case Handling:** It then calls `func_1` for each test case. Since `func_1` handles the input and output for each test case independently, the overall state of the program remains unchanged between calls.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the input for each test case.
- **Cumulative Counts:** The cumulative counts of '0's and '1's are calculated correctly and stored in the list `S`.
- **Condition Checking:** The conditions for laying the road are checked correctly for each possible position `i`.
- **Optimal Position:** The program correctly identifies the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the conditions.
- **Output:** The program prints the correct position for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program appears to meet all the requirements and constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
