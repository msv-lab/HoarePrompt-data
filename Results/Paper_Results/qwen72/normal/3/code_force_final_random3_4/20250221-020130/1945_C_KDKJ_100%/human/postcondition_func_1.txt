The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer from user input, which determines the number of times it will call the function `func_1`. The function `func_1` is called repeatedly, but since `func_1` does not modify any variables in the function signature of `func_2`, the overall state of the program remains unchanged after `func_2` concludes.
