You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:

        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.

        pl = []

                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)

                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: The loop executes `w` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `ln` and a list of integers `palka`. It then calculates the number of shapes that can be formed using the sticks, where a shape is defined as a set of three sticks of the same length. The result for each test case is printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `w` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks, followed by a list of integers `palka` representing the lengths of the sticks. The function then calculates the number of shapes that can be formed, where a shape is defined as a set of three sticks of the same length, and prints this number for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `w`, `ln`, and `palka` are consumed during the process but remain unchanged in the context of the function's execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks `palka`.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Shape Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each stick length `j`, it checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`).
   - If there are, it calculates the number of polygons that can be formed with that length by using integer division (`d[j] // 3`).
   - It adds this number to the `shapes` counter.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of shapes that can be formed for each test case.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The program assumes that each polygon must have exactly 3 sides (triangles). This is incorrect because the problem statement allows for polygons with any number of sides greater than or equal to 3.
- To correctly solve the problem, the program should check for the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with any number of sides (3 or more) for each unique stick length.

### Corrected Logic:
- For each unique stick length `j`, the number of polygons that can be formed is `d[j] // k` where `k` is the number of sides of the polygon.
- The maximum number of polygons that can be formed with `d[j]` sticks of length `j` is `d[j] // 3` (since a polygon with 3 sides is the minimum).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
        shapes = 0
        for j in d:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The dictionary `d` is used to count the frequency of each stick length.
- The loop `for j in d` iterates over the unique stick lengths.
- For each stick length `j`, it checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`).
- If there are, it calculates the number of polygons that can be formed with that length by using integer division (`d[j] // 3`).
- It adds this number to the `shapes` counter.
- Finally, it prints the number of shapes that can be formed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it only considers triangles, while the problem statement allows for polygons with any number of sides greater than or equal to 3.
