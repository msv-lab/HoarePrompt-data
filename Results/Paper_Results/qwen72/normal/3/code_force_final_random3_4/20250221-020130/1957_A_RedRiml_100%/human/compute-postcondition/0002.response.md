Output State: **The loop executes `w` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `ln` and a list of integers `palka`. It then calculates the number of shapes that can be formed using the sticks, where a shape is defined as a set of three sticks of the same length. The result for each test case is printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w` remain unchanged.**
