#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. It should accept parameters `t`, `cases` where `t` is the number of test cases and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has processed all test cases from the input, and for each test case, it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified within the loop. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated for each test case, but their final values are not retained after the loop completes. The loop itself has finished executing, and the program is ready to terminate or move on to the next part of the code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes each line as a test case, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The function processes each test case by extracting integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input, and determines if `a` meets certain criteria relative to `k` and `x`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program is ready to terminate or move on to the next part of the code.
