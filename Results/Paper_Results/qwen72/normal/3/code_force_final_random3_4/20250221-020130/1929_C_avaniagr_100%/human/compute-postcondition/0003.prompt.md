You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. It should accept parameters `t`, `cases` where `t` is the number of test cases and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has processed all test cases from the input, and for each test case, it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified within the loop. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated for each test case, but their final values are not retained after the loop completes. The loop itself has finished executing, and the program is ready to terminate or move on to the next part of the code.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t` and `cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
