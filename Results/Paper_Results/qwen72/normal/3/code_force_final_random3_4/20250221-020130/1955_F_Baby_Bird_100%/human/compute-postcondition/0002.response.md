Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` and a list `p_i` of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
