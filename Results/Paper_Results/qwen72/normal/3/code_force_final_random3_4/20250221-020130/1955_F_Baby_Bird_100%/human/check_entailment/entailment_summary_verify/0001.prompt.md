You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` and a list `p_i` of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve can remove numbers to maximize the number of times Bob wins.
   - The sequence consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - The input is a series of test cases, each with four integers representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - Bob wins if the total XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - Alice wins if the total XOR of the sequence is non-zero.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the total XOR zero as often as possible.
   - The XOR of the sequence can be influenced by the parity (odd or even) of the counts of each number.
   - Specifically, the XOR of the sequence will be zero if the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are such that their combined effect results in zero.

5. **Simplifying the Problem**:
   - The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have the following XOR properties:
     - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
     - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
     - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - This means that pairs of the same number or specific combinations of three different numbers can result in zero XOR.

6. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the total number of pairs and single numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - The formula used in the program is:
     \[
     \text{max\_wins} = \sum \left(3 \times \left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + \left(x \mod 2\right) \times (i < 3)\right) // 3
     \]
   - This formula essentially counts the number of pairs and single numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero, and then divides by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

7. **Verification**:
   - The formula correctly handles the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - It ensures that pairs of the same number are counted and single numbers are considered only if they can contribute to making the XOR zero.
   - The division by 3 ensures that the maximum number of wins is calculated correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.
