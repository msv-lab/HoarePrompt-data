### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve can remove numbers to maximize the number of times Bob wins.
   - The sequence consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - The input is a series of test cases, each with four integers representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - Bob wins if the total XOR of the sequence is zero.
   - Alice wins if the total XOR of the sequence is non-zero.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the total XOR zero as often as possible.
   - The XOR of the sequence can be influenced by the parity (odd or even) of the counts of each number.
   - Specifically, the XOR of the sequence will be zero if the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are such that their combined effect results in zero.

5. **Simplifying the Problem**:
   - The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have the following XOR properties:
     - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
     - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
     - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - This means that pairs of the same number or specific combinations of three different numbers can result in zero XOR.

6. **Algorithm**:
   - The formula used in the program is:
     \[
     \text{max\_wins} = \sum \left(3 \times \left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + \left(x \mod 2\right) \times (i < 3)\right) // 3
     \]
   - This formula essentially counts the number of pairs and single numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - The term \(3 \times \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\) counts the number of pairs of each number.
   - The term \(\left(x \mod 2\right) \times (i < 3)\) counts the number of single numbers that can contribute to making the XOR zero, but only for the first three numbers (1, 2, 3).

7. **Verification**:
   - The formula correctly handles the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - It ensures that pairs of the same number are counted and single numbers are considered only if they can contribute to making the XOR zero.
   - The division by 3 ensures that the maximum number of wins is calculated correctly.

### Detailed Analysis of the Formula:
- **Pairs of the Same Number**:
  - For each number \( x \) (where \( x \) is the count of 1, 2, 3, or 4), the term \(3 \times \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\) counts the number of pairs that can be removed. Each pair contributes to making the XOR zero.
- **Single Numbers**:
  - The term \(\left(x \mod 2\right) \times (i < 3)\) counts the number of single numbers that can contribute to making the XOR zero. This is only considered for the first three numbers (1, 2, 3) because the fourth number (4) does not form a valid combination with the first three to make the XOR zero.

  - Result: \(37 // 3 = 12\)

### Conclusion:
