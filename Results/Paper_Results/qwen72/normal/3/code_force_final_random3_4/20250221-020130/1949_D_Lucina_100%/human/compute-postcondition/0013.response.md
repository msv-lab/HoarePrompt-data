To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `xx` is a list of `n + 1` strings, with the first string being empty and the next `n` strings being user inputs.
- `a` and `b` are lists containing counts of 'F' and 'S' characters for each row and column, respectively.
- `sa` contains indices of rows or columns where the count of 'F' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'S' characters is 0.
- `sb` contains indices of rows or columns where the count of 'S' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'F' characters is 0.
- The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
- `t` is the length of `sa`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
