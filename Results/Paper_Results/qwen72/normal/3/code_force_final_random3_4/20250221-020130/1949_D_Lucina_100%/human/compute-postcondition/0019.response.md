The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. To ensure the loop executes, the range `1` to `n + 1` must be valid, which means `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `xx` remains unchanged, containing `n + 1` strings where the first string is empty and the next `n` strings are the inputs provided by the user.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged, containing the counts of 'F' and 'S' characters for each row and column, respectively.
- `sa` now contains the indices of the rows or columns where the count of 'F' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'S' characters is 0.
- `sb` now contains the indices of the rows or columns where the count of 'S' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'F' characters is 0.
- The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must start at 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
