Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `xx` remains unchanged, containing `n + 1` strings where the first string is empty and the next `n` strings are the inputs provided by the user. The list `a` and `b` also remain unchanged, containing the counts of 'F' and 'S' characters for each row and column, respectively. The list `sa` now contains the indices of the rows or columns where the count of 'F' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'S' characters is 0, as well as the indices of the rows or columns where both the count of 'F' and 'S' characters are 0. The list `sb` remains unchanged, containing the indices of the rows or columns where the count of 'S' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'F' characters is 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The variable `t` is assigned the value of the length of `sa` after the loop has executed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
