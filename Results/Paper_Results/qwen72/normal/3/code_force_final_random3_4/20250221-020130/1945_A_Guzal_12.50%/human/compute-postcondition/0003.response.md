The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided information, it seems there might be a misunderstanding since the output description is not provided. If the function is supposed to accept parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, and the output is based on these parameters, please provide the correct output description.

Assuming the function should accept parameters `a`, `b`, and `c` and return a value based on these parameters, the functionality would be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.**
