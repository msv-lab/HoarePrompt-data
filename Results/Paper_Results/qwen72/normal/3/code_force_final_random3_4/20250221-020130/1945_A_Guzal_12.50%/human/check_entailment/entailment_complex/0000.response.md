### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Tent Calculation:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert needs a separate tent, so the number of tents required for introverts is `a`.
   - **Extroverts:** Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. Therefore, the number of tents required for extroverts is `b // 3` if `b` is divisible by 3. If `b` is not divisible by 3, we need to check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in tents with extroverts and can also form their own tents if necessary.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts, making it impossible to fulfill the requirements. The function correctly prints `-1` in this case.
   - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it means there are still some participants left who cannot form a complete tent. The function correctly handles this by incrementing `k` by 1 to account for the additional tent needed.

4. **General Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the total number of tents as `a + (b + c) // 3` and then checks if there are any remaining participants. If there are, it adds one more tent to `k`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated number of tents `k` for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. It ensures that all participants are accommodated according to their preferences and outputs the minimum number of tents or `-1` if it is impossible.

**Correctness: True**
