Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program provided attempts to achieve this by printing specific pairs of coordinates for each test case.

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case individually by reading the integer \(n\).

2. **Output for Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program always prints the pairs `(1 1)` and `(1 2)`.
   - If \(n = 3\), it prints an additional pair `(2 3)`.
   - For \(n > 3\), it prints `(2 4)` and then prints pairs `(j j)` for \(j\) ranging from 4 to \(n\).

3. **Manhattan Distance Calculation:**
   - The Manhattan distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

4. **Analysis of Output:**
   - For \(n = 2\), the pairs `(1 1)` and `(1 2)` are printed. The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances \(\{1\}\), which is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).
   - For \(n = 3\), the pairs `(1 1)`, `(1 2)`, and `(2 3)` are printed. The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).
   - For \(n > 3\), the pairs `(1 1)`, `(1 2)`, `(2 4)`, and `(j j)` for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) are printed. The set \(\mathcal{H}\) should be analyzed to ensure it contains the maximum number of distinct distances.

5. **Checking Distinct Distances:**
   - For \(n = 4\), the pairs are `(1 1)`, `(1 2)`, `(2 4)`, and `(4 4)`. The distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
     - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
     - \(|1-2| + |2-4| = 3\)
     - \(|2-2| + |1-4| = 3\)
     - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
     - \(|4-4| + |4-4| = 0\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}\), which is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\).

6. **General Case for \(n > 3\):**
   - The pairs `(1 1)`, `(1 2)`, `(2 4)`, and `(j j)` for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) do not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). The distances between `(1 1)` and `(1 2)` are always \(\{0, 1\}\), and the distances between `(1 1)` and `(2 4)` are \(\{2, 3, 4\}\). However, the distances between `(j j)` and other points are not well-distributed to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct output to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
