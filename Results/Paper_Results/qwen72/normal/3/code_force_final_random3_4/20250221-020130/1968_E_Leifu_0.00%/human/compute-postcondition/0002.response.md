Output State: **t is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The loop has finished executing, and the values of t and n remain unchanged. The loop has printed '1 1', '1 2', and depending on the value of n, either '2 3' if n == 3, or '2 4' followed by pairs of integers (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n.**
