Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers where 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and `t` = 1, `edges` is an empty list, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and each value is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= `start` <= `n`, `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves from the `start` node to each leaf node, `empty` is True.**

Explanation:
- The code `nodes = defaultdict(list)` changes the `nodes` variable to a `defaultdict` with a default value of an empty list.
- This means that each key in `nodes` will now have an empty list as its value if it has not been explicitly set.
- The other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`, `moves`, `empty`) remain unchanged.
