The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `edges`, `nodes`, and `start`. 

- `n` and `t` are integers where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and t = 1.
- `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n.
- `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to n, and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the key node.
- `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.
- `moves` is a list of integers representing the number of moves from the start node to each leaf node.

The function returns the number of moves from the start node to each leaf node.
