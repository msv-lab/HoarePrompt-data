Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the calculated value of `ans`. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` retain their initial values, but the internal variables `a`, `c`, `i`, and `ans` are reset for each test case. The final state of the loop is that all test cases have been processed, and the corresponding `ans` values have been printed.**
