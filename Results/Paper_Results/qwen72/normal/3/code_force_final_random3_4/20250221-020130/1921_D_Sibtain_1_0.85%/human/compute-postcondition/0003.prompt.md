You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        a.sort()
        
        c.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
            continue
        
        i, ans = 0, 0
        
        while i < len(a) // 2:
            ans += abs(a[i] - c[i])
            i += 1
        
        j = len(c) - len(a) + i
        
        while i < len(a):
            ans += max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), abs(a[i] - c[j]))
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the calculated value of `ans`. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` retain their initial values, but the internal variables `a`, `c`, `i`, and `ans` are reset for each test case. The final state of the loop is that all test cases have been processed, and the corresponding `ans` values have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases defined by `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. It returns an error message if any of the parameters are out of their specified ranges or if the sum of `m` over all test cases exceeds 2 · 10^5. If all inputs are valid, it returns a result based on the specific logic applied to the lists `a_i` and `b_i`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
