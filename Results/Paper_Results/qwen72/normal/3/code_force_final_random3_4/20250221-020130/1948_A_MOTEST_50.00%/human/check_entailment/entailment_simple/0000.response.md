Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the integer `n` for each test case.
   - The input constraints are respected, with `t` and `n` being within the specified ranges.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the special case where `n == 1`. Since a string with exactly one special character is impossible (a special character must have a neighbor), the program prints 'NO' for this case.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For `n > 1`, the program constructs a string `ans` that contains exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs the string by repeating each of the first `n // 2` letters of the uppercase alphabet twice. This ensures that each repeated letter is a special character because it is equal to its neighbor.
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts the string with 'AAA' (which contains 3 special characters) and then repeats each of the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of the alphabet twice. This ensures that the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans` for valid cases.
   - The length of the constructed string is at most 200, which satisfies the problem's requirement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case `n == 1` correctly.
   - For other values of `n`, the program ensures that the string has the correct number of special characters and meets the length constraint.

6. **Console Clearing**:
   - The use of `os.system('cls')` to clear the console is not necessary for the problem's requirements and could be removed without affecting the correctness of the solution. However, it does not interfere with the logic of the program.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
