### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because a special character must have a neighbor, and if it has only one neighbor, it cannot be special.

3. **String Construction:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program constructs a string `ans` that contains exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs the string by repeating each letter from `string.ascii_uppercase` twice, `n // 2` times. This ensures that each repeated letter is a special character because it is equal to its neighbor.
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with the string "AAA" (which has 3 special characters) and then constructs the rest of the string by repeating each subsequent letter from `string.ascii_uppercase` twice, `n // 2 - 1` times. This ensures that the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string `ans` if `n` is greater than 1.
   - The program prints "NO" if `n` is 1.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
   - The program ensures that the constructed string has at most 200 characters, as required by the problem statement. Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `ans` will be `2 * 50 = 100` characters, which is within the limit.

6. **General Validity:**
   - The program uses the `string.ascii_uppercase` to ensure that it has enough unique characters to construct the string.
   - The logic for constructing the string is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the string has exactly `n` special characters and that the string length does not exceed 200 characters.

### Correctness:
**True**
