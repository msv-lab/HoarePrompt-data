t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 × 10^5; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 × 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}; d is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9; f is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sums of n, m, and k over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, 2 × 10^5, and 2 × 10^5, respectively.
