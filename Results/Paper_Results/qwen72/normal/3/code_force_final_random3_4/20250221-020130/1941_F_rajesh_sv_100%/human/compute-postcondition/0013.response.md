Functionality: ** The function `func_6` takes no explicit parameters but uses values returned from `func_4` to determine the largest and second largest differences between consecutive elements in a strictly increasing list `A`. It then calculates the minimum possible value of the maximum difference between `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` for each `f` in `F`, where `D` is a sorted list of unique integers, and `left` and `right` are the elements in `A` where the largest difference occurs. Finally, it prints the maximum of this calculated value and the second largest difference found in `A`. The function does not return any value. **
