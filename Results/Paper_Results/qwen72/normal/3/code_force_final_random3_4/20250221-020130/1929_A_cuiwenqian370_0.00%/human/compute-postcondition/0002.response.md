Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0.** 

The initial state is updated with the new variable `left` being assigned the value 0. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
