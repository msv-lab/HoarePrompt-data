The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`. The loop condition is `left <= right`. Right before the loop, `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `right` will be at least 1 (since `n - 1` for the smallest value of `n` is 1).

Since `left` is 0 and `right` is at least 1, the condition `left <= right` is already satisfied, and the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`**
