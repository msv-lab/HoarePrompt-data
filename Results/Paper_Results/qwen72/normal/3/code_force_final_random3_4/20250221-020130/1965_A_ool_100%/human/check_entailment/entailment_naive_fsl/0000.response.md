Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all piles have the same number of stones correctly. According to the problem description, if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can win by choosing \( k \) equal to the number of stones in each pile, which will empty all piles in one move. However, the function `func_1` in the provided program does not account for this scenario. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```

The program should output "Alice" because Alice can win by choosing \( k = 3 \). However, the current implementation of `func_1` will return "Bob" because it checks if the smallest pile is 1 and then proceeds to check the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set of pile sizes, which is not the correct logic for this specific case.
