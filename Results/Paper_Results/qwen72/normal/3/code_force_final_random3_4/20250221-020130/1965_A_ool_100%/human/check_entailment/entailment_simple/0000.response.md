Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list `arr` for each test case.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to determine the winner.
   - It creates a sorted list `set_` of unique elements from `arr`.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - If the smallest pile size (the first element in `set_`) is not 1, Alice can win by removing all stones from the smallest pile in her first move. This is because Bob will then be forced to make a move with a smaller `k`, and Alice can always mirror Bob's moves until Bob is unable to make a move. Therefore, the program correctly returns 'Alice' in this case.

4. **Difference Check**:
   - The program then iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop.
   - If the difference is exactly 1, it toggles the value of `A` (i.e., `A = not A`).

5. **Final Check**:
   - If `not_c` is `True` (i.e., all differences between consecutive pile sizes are exactly 1), it toggles `A` one more time.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' otherwise.

6. **Optimal Play**:
   - The logic of the program is based on the observation that if the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by removing all stones from the smallest pile.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1 and the differences between consecutive pile sizes are exactly 1, the game can be reduced to a sequence of moves where each player can only remove 1 stone from each pile. In this case, the winner depends on the parity of the number of piles with more than 1 stone.
   - The program correctly toggles `A` based on the parity of the number of unique pile sizes, which is a valid strategy for determining the winner in this game.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the smallest pile size is not 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the smallest pile size is 1 and the differences between consecutive pile sizes are exactly 1 correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
