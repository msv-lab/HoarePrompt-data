### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **String Construction:**
   - The function initializes a list `s` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This list keeps track of the number of times each character has been used.
   - It then iterates over the trace array `a` and constructs the string `ans` by converting each element `j` in `a` to a corresponding character. The character is determined by the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`, which maps to a lowercase Latin letter.
   - After adding the character to `ans`, the function increments the value at index `j` in the list `s`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case.

4. **Validation:**
   - The function correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
   - The trace array `a` is processed correctly to reconstruct a string `s` that matches the given trace.
   - The function ensures that the characters are chosen from the lowercase Latin letters `a-z`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function works for the edge case where `n = 1` and the trace array is `[0]`, correctly outputting a single character string `a`.
   - It also handles cases where the trace array is all zeros, such as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, correctly outputting a string of the same character repeated `n` times, like `aaaaaaaa`.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input trace `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`, the function correctly outputs `abracadabra`.
   - For the input trace `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`, the function correctly outputs `codeforces`.
   - For the input trace `[0]`, the function correctly outputs `a`.
   - For the input trace `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, the function correctly outputs `abcdefgh`.
   - For the input trace `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the function correctly outputs `aaaaaaaa`.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program correctly reconstructs a string from the given trace array for each test case, adhering to the problem's constraints and requirements.
