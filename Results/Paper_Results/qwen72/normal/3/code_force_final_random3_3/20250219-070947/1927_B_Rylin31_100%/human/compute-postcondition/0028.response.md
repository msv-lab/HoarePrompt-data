Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 1, `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` where the element at index `j` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `j` is the third element of `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` and then the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t`, `i`, `l`, `s`, `array`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The variable `ans` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` to the existing string.
- Since `s[j]` is 2, `s[j] + 97` is 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'.
- Therefore, `ans` now contains the character 'c' appended to the existing string, which was 'cc'.
- The final value of `ans` is 'ccc'.
