Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 1, `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` where the element at index `j` is 3 and all other elements are 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `j` is the third element of `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` and then the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s[j]` is incremented by 1.
- Initially, `s[j]` was 2, so after the increment, `s[j]` becomes 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
