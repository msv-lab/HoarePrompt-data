Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 2, `l` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 1), `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code snippet `ans = ''` resets the variable `ans` to an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `ans` being a string containing characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array` is no longer valid, as `ans` is now an empty string.
