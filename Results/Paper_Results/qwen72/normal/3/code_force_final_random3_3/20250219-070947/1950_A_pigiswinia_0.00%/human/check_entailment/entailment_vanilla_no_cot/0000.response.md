Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is almost correct, but there is a minor issue with the output for the "STAIR" condition. The problem description specifies that the output should be "STAIR" (without an 'S'), but the program outputs "STAIRS" (with an 'S'). This discrepancy will cause the program to produce incorrect output according to the problem's requirements.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')  # Corrected from 'STAIRS' to 'STAIR'
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this correction, the program will produce the correct output for all test cases.
