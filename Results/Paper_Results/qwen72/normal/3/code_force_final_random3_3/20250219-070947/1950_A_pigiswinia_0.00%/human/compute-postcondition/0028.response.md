Functionality: ** The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9) from the input. It then prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After `t` iterations, the function completes, and the program state is such that `t` iterations have been processed, with the appropriate output printed for each set of inputs. **
