You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9) from the input. It then prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After `t` iterations, the function completes, and the program state is such that `t` iterations have been processed, with the appropriate output printed for each set of inputs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and then iterates over each test case. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Reading Test Cases**: For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is also correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct for identifying a stair.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is correct for identifying a peak.
   - If neither condition is met, the program prints "NONE". This is correct as per the problem description.

4. **Output**:
   - For a stair, the program prints "STAIRS". However, the problem description specifies that the output should be "STAIR" (without the 'S'). This is a minor issue but it affects the correctness of the program.
   - For a peak, the program prints "PEAK", which is correct.
   - For neither, the program prints "NONE", which is correct.

Given the above points, the program is almost correct but has a small issue with the output for the "STAIR" case.

Correctness: **False**
