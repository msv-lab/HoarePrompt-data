The function `func` is called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each iteration, the function receives three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each integer is between 0 and 9 inclusive. However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters, so it is assumed that the function `func` is designed to handle these inputs internally or through some other mechanism (e.g., global variables, user input, etc.).

Since the function signature does not explicitly show the parameters, and based on the context provided, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times (1 <= t <= 1000). For each iteration, it processes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9) and returns a result based on these inputs.**
