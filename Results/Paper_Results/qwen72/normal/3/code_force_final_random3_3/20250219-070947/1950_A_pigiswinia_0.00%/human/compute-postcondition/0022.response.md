Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds.
- If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds.
- Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'PEAK'`.
- The initial state provides conditions for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
