Output State: **The function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. For each iteration, the function receives three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each integer is between 0 and 9 inclusive. `t` is now an input integer.**
