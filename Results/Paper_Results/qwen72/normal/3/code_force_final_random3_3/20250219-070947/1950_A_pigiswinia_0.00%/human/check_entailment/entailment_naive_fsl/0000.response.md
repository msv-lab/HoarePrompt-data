Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program is incorrect because it prints "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR" when the digits form a stair. The problem description specifies that the output should be "STAIR" (without the 'S') if the digits form a stair. This discrepancy means the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

For example, for the input:
```
1
1 2 3
```
The expected output is:
```
STAIR
```
But the program will output:
```
STAIRS
```
This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected.
