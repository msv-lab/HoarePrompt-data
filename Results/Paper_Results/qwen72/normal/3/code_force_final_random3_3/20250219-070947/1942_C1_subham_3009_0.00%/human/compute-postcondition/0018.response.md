Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 2 and is now `t - 3` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers representing the first `x` input values.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]` converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr` from strings to integers.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The new `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the corresponding string from the initial `arr` to an integer.
- The length of the new `arr` is `x`, as it only includes the first `x` elements of the original `arr`.
