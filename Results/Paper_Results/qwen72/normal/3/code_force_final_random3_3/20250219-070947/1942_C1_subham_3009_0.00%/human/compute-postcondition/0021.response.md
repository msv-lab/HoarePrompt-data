Postcondition: ***If the script is run as the main module, `t` is 0, and the loop has completed all iterations. For each iteration, `n`, `x`, and `y` were input integers, and `arr` was a list of integers of length `x`. The function printed `x - 2` for each test case. If the script is not run as the main module, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
