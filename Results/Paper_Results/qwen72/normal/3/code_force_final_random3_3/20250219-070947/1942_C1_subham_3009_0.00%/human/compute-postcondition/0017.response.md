Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 2 and is now `t - 3` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of strings representing the input values.**

The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The initial state specifies that `n`, `x`, and `y` are already integers from the input, but `arr` is now updated to be a list of strings, each representing an input value. The other variables remain unchanged.
