Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out by choosing vertices to form diagonals in a regular polygon. Given that `y = 0`, Bessie has already chosen all the vertices that can be used, and no additional vertices can be chosen. The key insight here is that in a regular polygon, the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2`. This is a well-known property of triangulation in polygons.

The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`. It then reads `x` vertices chosen by Bessie. The program correctly prints `x - 2` for each test case, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed using the `x` chosen vertices.

The program's behavior matches the expected output for the given problem constraints and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
