Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer greater than 0, and `t` is now `t - 1`.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are input integers.
   - `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the first `x` strings in the original `arr` to integers.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(x - 2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the value of `x - 2`.
   - The value of `x` is an input integer, and the exact value is not specified in the initial state.
   - Therefore, the output will be the value of `x` minus 2.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `x` is an input integer, the output will be `x - 2`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the input integer)**
