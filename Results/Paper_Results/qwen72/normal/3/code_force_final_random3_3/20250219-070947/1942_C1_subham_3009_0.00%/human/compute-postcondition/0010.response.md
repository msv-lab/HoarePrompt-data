Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 and is now `t - 2` (which must still be greater than 0), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the first `x` strings in the original `arr` to integers.**

The code snippet `[n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings, and converts each string to an integer, assigning these integers to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state of `t` and `arr` remains unchanged, and `n`, `x`, and `y` are now updated to the new input integers.
