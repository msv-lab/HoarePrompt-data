The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer greater than 2 and is now `t - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t - 2` must still be greater than 0, which means the original value of `t` must have been greater than 2.

Since `t` is already `t - 2` and we need `t` to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, we can simply state that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 2 and is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers of length `x`**
