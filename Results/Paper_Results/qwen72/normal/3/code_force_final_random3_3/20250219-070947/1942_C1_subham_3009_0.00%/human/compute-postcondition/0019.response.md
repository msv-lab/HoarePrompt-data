Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer greater than 2 and is now `t - 3`, and it must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer from the input.
   - `y` is the third integer from the input.
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing the first `x` input values.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(x - 2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet only involves the variable `x`.
   - `x` is the second integer from the input.
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `x - 2`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `x` is the second integer from the input, the value of `x - 2` will be the second integer from the input minus 2.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `x - 2`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second integer from the input)**
