You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program: 
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            print(x - 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to solve the given problem. It should be defined as `def func(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (y = 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: `t` is 0, and the loop has completed all iterations. For each iteration, `n`, `x`, and `y` were input integers, and `arr` was a list of integers of length `x`. The function printed `x - 2` for each test case.
    #State: *If the script is run as the main module, `t` is 0, and the loop has completed all iterations. For each iteration, `n`, `x`, and `y` were input integers, and `arr` was a list of integers of length `x`. The function printed `x - 2` for each test case. If the script is not run as the main module, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. If the script is run as the main module, it reads an integer `t` from the user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the user input, followed by a list of `x` integers. The function then prints `x - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the loop has completed all iterations. If the script is not run as the main module, the function does nothing and the state of the variables remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - The constraint `y = 0` means we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - In a regular polygon, the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is given by `x - 2`. This is a well-known property of triangulation in polygons.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints `x - 2` for each test case, which is the correct number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints: `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `4 <= n <= 10^9`, `2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, and `y = 0`.
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient as it only performs a few operations per test case, which is suitable for the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly solves the problem by outputting the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

Correctness: **True**
