Reasoning:

The program provided is not correct for the given problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` is defined without parameters, but it should take parameters to process the input for each test case. The correct definition should be `def func(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):`.

2. **Output Calculation**: The program prints `x - 2` for each test case. This is incorrect because the number of triangular pieces that can be formed is not necessarily `x - 2`. The number of triangles formed by non-intersecting diagonals in a polygon with `x` chosen vertices is more complex and depends on the specific vertices chosen and their arrangement.

3. **Handling of `y`**: The problem states that `y = 0` in this version, so you cannot choose any additional vertices. The program should focus on maximizing the number of triangles using only the `x` vertices Bessie has chosen.

4. **Algorithm**: The program does not implement any algorithm to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces. It simply prints `x - 2`, which is a heuristic that does not always hold true.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to:
- Parse the input correctly.
- Implement an algorithm to count the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.
- Ensure that the diagonals do not intersect.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
