Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. The problem states that Bessie has chosen \(x\) vertices and you can choose no more than \(y\) additional vertices. However, in this version, \(y = 0\), meaning you cannot choose any additional vertices. Therefore, the only vertices available for forming triangles are the \(x\) vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. The number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed from \(x\) vertices in a convex polygon is \(x - 2\). This is a well-known result in combinatorial geometry: any triangulation of a convex polygon with \(x\) vertices will always result in \(x - 2\) triangles.

3. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, it reads the values of \(n\), \(x\), and \(y\). It then reads the \(x\) vertices chosen by Bessie and prints \(x - 2\), which is the correct number of triangular pieces that can be formed using the \(x\) chosen vertices.

4. The program does not need to use the value of \(n\) or the specific vertices chosen by Bessie, as the number of triangles is solely determined by the number of vertices \(x\).

Thus, the program is correct for the given problem constraints and requirements.
