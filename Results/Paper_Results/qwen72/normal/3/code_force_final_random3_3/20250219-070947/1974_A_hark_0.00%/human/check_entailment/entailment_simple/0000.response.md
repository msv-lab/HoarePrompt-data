### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is not used in the program, so it does not affect the correctness of the solution. It simply returns the smaller of two values, but it is never called.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - The function calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`) using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen can hold 15 cells, so the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - It then updates `x` to account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` because each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen can hold 15 - 4 = 11 more 1x1 icons.
     - The function then calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1`). The formula `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` without the `+ 1` because if `x` is exactly 15, it should still fit in one screen.
     - The function prints the total number of screens required, which is `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.

   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - The function correctly calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - The function prints this value, which is correct.

   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - The function correctly calculates the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - The function prints this value, which is correct.

   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - The function correctly prints 0, which is correct.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - **Loop**: The function correctly iterates `t` times and calls `func_2()` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error in the calculation of the remaining 1x1 icons when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. Specifically, the formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11`, and the formula `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` should be `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

### Correctness: **False**
