The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraint provided, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or missing information, as the function signature does not include a parameter `t`. Assuming the function internally uses a variable `t` that is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the function's output is not specified in the given information. Therefore, I cannot accurately describe the return value without additional details.

However, if we assume the function is supposed to return something based on `t`, and since the output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of such functions.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It is expected to internally use a non-negative integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, but the specific return value based on `t` is not provided.**
