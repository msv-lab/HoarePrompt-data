Postcondition: **x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and x, y are now assigned new values from user input. If x == 0 and y > 0, the current value of x is 0, and the current value of y is greater than 0. If x > 0 and y == 0, the current value of x is greater than 0, and the current value of y is 0. Otherwise, either x is 0 or y is 0, but it is not the case that (x == 0 and y > 0).**
