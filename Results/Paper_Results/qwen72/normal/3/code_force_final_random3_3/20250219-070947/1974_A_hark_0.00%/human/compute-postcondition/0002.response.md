Initial State: `t` is an input integer, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable

```
func_2()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet calls the function `func_2()`. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine its exact behavior or the changes it might make to the variables. However, we can assume that it does not modify the global variables `t` or `_` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable.**
