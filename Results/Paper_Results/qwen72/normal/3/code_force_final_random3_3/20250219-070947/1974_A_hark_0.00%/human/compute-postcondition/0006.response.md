Output State: **`_` is incremented to be one more than its previous value, `t` must be greater than `_`, and `func_2()` has been called.** 

The value of `_` has been incremented by 1, and the condition that `t` must be greater than `_` still holds. The function `func_2()` has been executed, but since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine its impact on the state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `_` and the unchanged condition for `t`.
