Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and `func_2()` has been called `t` times.** 

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop has run exactly `t` times, where `t` is the input integer provided initially. During each iteration, the placeholder variable `_` was used, but its value is not retained or significant. The function `func_2()` has been called once for each iteration, so it has been called a total of `t` times. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is the input and is not modified within the loop.
