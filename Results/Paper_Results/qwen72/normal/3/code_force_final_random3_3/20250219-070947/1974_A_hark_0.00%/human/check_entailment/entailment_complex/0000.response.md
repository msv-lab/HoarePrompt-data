Reasoning:

1. **Function 3**: This function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. It then calls `func_2` `t` times. This part of the program is correct because it correctly handles the input and iterates over the test cases as required by the problem statement.

2. **Function 2**: This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of screens needed based on the following logic:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons.
     - It updates `x` to account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons. The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is intended to adjust `x` by subtracting the space taken by the 2x2 icons and adding back the space they occupy (since `y * 4` is the total space taken by `y` 2x2 icons).
     - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` is 0; otherwise, it is the ceiling of `x / 15` plus 1.
     - It prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
     - It prints the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is the number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons.
   - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
     - It prints the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is the number of screens needed to place all 1x1 icons.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
     - It prints 0, which is correct because no screens are needed.

3. **Function 1**: This function is not used in the program. It simply returns the smaller of two values, but it is not called anywhere in the code. Therefore, it does not affect the correctness of the program.

**Issues**:
- The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` in `func_2` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `x - bxsfory * 11` because each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so after placing `bxsfory` 2x2 icons, `bxsfory * 11` cells are occupied (4 cells per 2x2 icon plus 7 cells for the 1x1 icons that could have been placed in the same screen).

**Conclusion**:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed formula in `func_2` for calculating the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

Correctness: **False**
