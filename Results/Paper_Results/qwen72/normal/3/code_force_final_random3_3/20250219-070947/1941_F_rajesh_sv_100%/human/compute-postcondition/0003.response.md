The only object in the loop head is the variable `testcases`. The loop can execute again if `testcases` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` must be greater than 0, and `func_6()` has been called. Since the loop variable `_` is not used and is incremented internally by the `range` function, we do not need to adjust it. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0, `func_6()` has been called.**
