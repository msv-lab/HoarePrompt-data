The function `wrapper` does not accept any parameters. It checks if the tuple `args` is a key in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not in `d`, it calls `func` with the arguments in `args`, stores the result in `d` with `args` as the key, and returns this result. If `args` is already in `d`, it simply returns the value associated with `args` in `d` without modifying the dictionary.
