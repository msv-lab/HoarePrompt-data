Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `max_diff` is now `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `max_diff` (which is the same as the previous `max_diff`), `index` is 2, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`.**
