Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `A` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A[i] < A[i+1], `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the values returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `max_diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`, `next_max_diff` is -inf, `index` is 1, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `index`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
