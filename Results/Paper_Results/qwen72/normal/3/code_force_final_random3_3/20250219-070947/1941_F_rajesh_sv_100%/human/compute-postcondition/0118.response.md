The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters based on the provided function signature. However, the parameter constraints and relationships suggest that the function might use global variables or parameters that are not explicitly passed to the function. The constraints indicate that there are three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specific ranges, and three lists `A`, `D`, and `F` with specific properties. Since the function signature does not include these parameters, we can only describe the output based on the given constraints.

Output:
Case_1: If the function processes the data and meets the specified constraints, it returns a result based on the processing of the lists `A`, `D`, and `F`.
Case_2: If the function encounters an error or an invalid state (e.g., if the lists do not meet the specified constraints), it may return an error message or a specific error value.

Functionality: **The function processes global or predefined lists `A`, `D`, and `F` and returns a result based on the processing of these lists. If the lists do not meet the specified constraints, it may return an error message or a specific error value.**
