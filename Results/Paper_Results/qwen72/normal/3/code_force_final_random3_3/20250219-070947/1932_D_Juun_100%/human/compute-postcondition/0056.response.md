Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, `trump` is an input string, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value set to a non-`None` value, `suit` is the next key in the dictionary `suits`, and `rank` is the value associated with the next key in the dictionary `suits`. If `trumps` is not an empty list and `rank` is not `None`, the `answers` list has one more element, which is a string in the format `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, and the `trumps` list has one less element. If `trumps` is not an empty list but `rank` is `None`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. If `trumps` is an empty list, the program does not return any value.***
