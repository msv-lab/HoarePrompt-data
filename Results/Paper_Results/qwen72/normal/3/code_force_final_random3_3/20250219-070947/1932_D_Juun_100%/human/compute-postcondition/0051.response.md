Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings, `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is a list with one less element, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value set to a non-`None` value, `answers` is a list containing strings, `suit` is the next key in the dictionary `suits`, and `rank` is the value associated with the next key in the dictionary `suits`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**
