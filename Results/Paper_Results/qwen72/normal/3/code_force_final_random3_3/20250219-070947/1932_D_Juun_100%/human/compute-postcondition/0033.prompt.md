Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the current card if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` remains an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`, `rank` is the first character of the string `card`, `suit` is the second character of the string `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` contains the rank of the current card. If `suit` is not equal to `trump` and `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list containing a single string which is the result of joining two sorted two-character strings, where the first string is the value of `suits[suit]` and the second string is `rank` followed by `suit`, and the value for the key `suit` in `suits` is set to `None`. Otherwise, `answers` remains an empty list and the value of `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the current card if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` remains an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, the list `trumps` now contains the rank of the current card. If `suit` is not equal to `trump` and `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list that now contains a single string which is the concatenation of `rank` and `suit` in sorted order, separated by a space. Otherwise, the value of the key `suit` in `suits` is set to `rank`, and `answers` is a list that may contain a single string or remain empty. `card` is the next element in the list generated by `input().split()`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the current card if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` remains an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` contains the rank of the current card. If `suit` is not equal to `trump` and `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `suits[suit]` is set to `None`, and `answers` is a list with one more element appended, which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` (which is now `None`) and `rank` with `suit` appended to each. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is `None`, the value of the key `suit` in `suits` is set to `rank`. In all cases, `rank` is the first character of the next card in the `cards` list, `suit` is the second character of the next card in the `cards` list, and `card` is the next element in the list generated by `input().split()`, and the list must have at least one more element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
