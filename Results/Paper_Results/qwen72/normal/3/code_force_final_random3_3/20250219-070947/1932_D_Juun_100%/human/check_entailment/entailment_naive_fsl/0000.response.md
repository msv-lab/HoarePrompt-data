Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple non-trump cards of the same suit, and the second player cannot beat the first player's card with a higher-ranked card of the same suit. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S
```

The program will output:
```
3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S
```

However, in the second round, the second player cannot beat the first player's card `6D` with `9S` because they are of different suits and `9S` is a trump card. The correct output should be:

```
3C 4C
3S 7S
6D 9S
```

This shows that the program does not correctly handle the order of operations and the rules for beating cards, leading to an incorrect solution.
