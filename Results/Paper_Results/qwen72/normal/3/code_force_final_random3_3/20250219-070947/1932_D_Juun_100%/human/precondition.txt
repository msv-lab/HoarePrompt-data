The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a trump suit (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n unique cards, each represented by a two-character string where the first character is the rank (one of "23456789") and the second character is the suit (one of "CDHS"). The output for each test case is either a sequence of n lines, each containing two cards (the first card played and the card that beat it), or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no valid sequence can be found.
