Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump_suit` is a character from "CDHS", `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where the first character is a rank from "23456789" and the second character is a suit from "CDHS", `trump` is an input string, `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the current card if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` remains an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` contains the rank of the current card. If `suit` is not equal to `trump` and `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `suits[suit]` is set to `None`, and `answers` is a list with one more element appended, which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` (which is now `None`) and `rank` with `suit` appended to each. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is `None`, the value of the key `suit` in `suits` is set to `rank`. In all cases, `rank` is the first character of the next card in the `cards` list, `suit` is the second character of the next card in the `cards` list, and `card` is the next element in the list generated by `input().split()`, and the list must have at least one more element.***
