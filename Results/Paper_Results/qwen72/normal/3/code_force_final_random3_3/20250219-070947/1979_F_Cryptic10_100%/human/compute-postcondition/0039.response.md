The only object in the loop head is the range generated by `int(input())`. The loop can execute one more time if the range has not been fully iterated over. Since the loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, which is not used within the loop body, the only state that matters is the remaining number of iterations in the range.

At the end of the previous iteration, the range has been iterated over once, so the number of remaining iterations is one less than the original number of iterations specified by `int(input())`.

State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers, `ops` is a list containing all the tuples it originally had, `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx` and all `v1` values from `ops` tuples where `p1[-1]` was not equal to `v2`, `p2` is a list containing all `v1` values from `ops` tuples where `p1[-1]` was equal to `v2`, the loop will execute one more time if the original input was greater than 1**
