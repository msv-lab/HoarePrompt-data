The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v1` and `v2` from the tuple in the reversed `ops` list, and the list `ops` itself. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop will proceed with the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`.
- `p2` is an empty list.
- `ops` must contain at least two tuples.
- `v1` and `v2` are the values from the second tuple in the reversed `ops` list.
- `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left.
- If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`. Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list must be the third tuple from the end of the original `ops` list. This means that `ops` must have at least three tuples for the loop to continue.

State at the start of the next iteration:
- `v1` and `v2` will be the values from the third tuple in the reversed `ops` list.
- `ops` must contain at least three tuples.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` must contain at least three tuples, `v1` and `v2` are the values from the third tuple in the reversed `ops` list, `vx` is a set with at most 2 elements left.**
