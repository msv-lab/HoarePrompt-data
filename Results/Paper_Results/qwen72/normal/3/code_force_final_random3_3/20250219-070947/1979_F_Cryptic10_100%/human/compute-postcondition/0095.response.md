Output State: **`v1` has been removed from `vx`, `v2` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0, `ops` contains tuples based on the value of `v2` and now includes `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` now contains at least 1 element, `v3` has been removed from `vx`.**

The code snippet `ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` appends two new tuples to the list `ops`. The tuples are `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, where `v3` and `v1` are values that have been removed from `vx`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
