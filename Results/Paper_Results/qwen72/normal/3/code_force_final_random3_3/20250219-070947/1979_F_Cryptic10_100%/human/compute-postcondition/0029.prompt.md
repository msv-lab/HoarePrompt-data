Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `q` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the integer value read from the input (inclusive), and `ops` is an empty list. The integer value read from the input must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The function `q` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the integer value read from the input (inclusive), but `v1` has been removed from `vx`. `ops` is a list. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`, and `v3` is also removed from `vx`. In this case, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`, but `v1` is no longer in `vx`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The function `q` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the integer value read from the input (inclusive), but `v1`, `v3`, and the new `v1` have been removed from `vx`, and `vx` must have at least 3 elements. `ops` is a list. If the new `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If the new `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`, and `v3` is no longer in `vx`. In this case, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. `v1` and `v2` are the new values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`, and `v1` is no longer in `vx`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The function `q` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the integer value read from the input (inclusive), but the new `v1`, the previous `v1`, and `v3` have been removed from `vx`, and `vx` must have at least 3 elements. `v1` is no longer in `vx`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` in addition to any existing tuples. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`, and `v3` is no longer in `vx`. In this case, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` in addition to any existing tuples.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
