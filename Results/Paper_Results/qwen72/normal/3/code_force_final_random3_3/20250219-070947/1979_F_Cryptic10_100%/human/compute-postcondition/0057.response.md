Output State: **`v3` is the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument 0, `v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1` and `v3` if `v2` > 0, or `vx` also excludes `v3` if `v2` â‰¤ 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(v1, v2)` and additionally `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `v2` is greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0 as initially determined, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.**
