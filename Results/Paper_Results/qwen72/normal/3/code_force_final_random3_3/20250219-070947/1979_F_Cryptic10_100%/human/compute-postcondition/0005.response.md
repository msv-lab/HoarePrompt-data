Output State: **The function `q` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the integer value read from the input (inclusive), but `v1` has been removed from `vx`. `ops` is an empty list. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`, but `v1` is no longer in `vx`.**
