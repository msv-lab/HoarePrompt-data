Output State: **`v1` has been removed from `vx`, `v2` is either greater than 0 or less than or equal to 0, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` <= 0, `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v3` has been removed from `vx`. `v3` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `v3, _ = q(0)` assigns the value 0 to `v3` and discards the second value returned by the function `q`. The initial state is updated to reflect that `v3` is now 0, while the other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
