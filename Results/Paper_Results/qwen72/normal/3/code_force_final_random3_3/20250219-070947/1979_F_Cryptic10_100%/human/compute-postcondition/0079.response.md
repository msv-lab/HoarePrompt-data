The only variable in the loop head is `vx`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `vx`. If the length of `vx` is greater than 2, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive). For the loop to execute the first time, the length of `vx` must be greater than 2, which means the input integer must be greater than 2.

State: **`ops` is empty, `p1` contains the remaining elements of `vx` and any elements from `ops` that were appended to it, `p2` contains elements from `ops` that were appended to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) and the input integer must be greater than 2**
