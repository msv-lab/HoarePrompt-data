The only variable in the loop head is `vx`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `vx`. If the length of `vx` is greater than 2, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive). For the loop to execute the first time, the length of `vx` must be greater than 2, which means the input integer must be greater than 2.

State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) where the input integer must be greater than 2, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged**
