Output State: **The function `q` remains unchanged. `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to the integer value read from the input (inclusive). `ops` is a list containing tuples, where each tuple represents the elements removed from `vx` during the iterations. If `v2` > 0, the tuple `(v1, v2)` is added to `ops`. If `v2` â‰¤ 0, the tuple `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` are added to `ops`. The exact elements in `vx` and the contents of `ops` depend on the values returned by the function `q` during each iteration. `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`. `p2` is an empty list.**
