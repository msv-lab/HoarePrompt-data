Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are updated to the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) except for `v1`, and `v1` is removed from `vx`. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `v2` is greater than 0. If `v2` ≤ 0, `vx` also excludes `v3`, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. The tuple `(v1, v2)` is appended to `ops`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends the tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`.
- The initial state indicates that `v1` and `v2` are already updated based on the function `q` and the conditions provided.
- If `v2` > 0, `ops` already contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`, and appending `(v1, v2)` again means `ops` now contains two instances of `(v1, v2)`.
- If `v2` ≤ 0, `ops` already contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and appending `(v1, v2)` means `ops` now contains `(v3, 0)`, `(v1, 0)`, and `(v1, v2)`.
- The values of `v1`, `v2`, `vx`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
- The only change is the addition of the tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`.
