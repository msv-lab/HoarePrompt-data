The only object in the loop head is the range that depends on the integer value read from the input. For the loop to execute, the integer value read from the input must be greater than 0.

State: **The function `q` is defined as a lambda function that prints a query "? d" to the console, where `d` is an integer, and then reads a response from the input, converting it to a map of integers. The initial state remains unchanged, and the function can now be used to make queries to the interactor. The integer value read from the input must be greater than 0.**
