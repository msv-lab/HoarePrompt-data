The code `new_arr.append(arr[left])` adds the element at index `left` of the list `arr` to the list `new_arr`. The initial state specifies that `left` is 1, and `right` is `n - 2`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` initially contains the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` initially contains the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`.

Given this, the element at index 1 of `arr` is added to `new_arr`. Therefore, the output state is:

- If `left` is equal to `right` (i.e., `1 == n - 2`), `new_arr` will contain the first element of `arr` and the element at index 1 of `arr`.
- Otherwise, `new_arr` will contain the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, and the element at index 1 of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 2`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the first element of `arr` and the element at index 1 of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the last element of `arr`, the first element of `arr`, and the element at index 1 of `arr`.**
