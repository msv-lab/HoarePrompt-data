Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, we should try to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. 

The given program sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements by placing the largest and smallest elements next to each other as much as possible.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order. This is a good first step because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Constructing the New Array**: The program constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. This is done using two pointers, `left` and `right`, which start from the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively. The elements are appended to `new_arr` in a mirrored order:
   - If `left` equals `right`, it means there is only one element left, which is added to `new_arr`.
   - Otherwise, the largest element (`arr[right]`) and the smallest element (`arr[left]`) are added to `new_arr` in that order.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Beauty**: The program then calculates the maximum beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

This approach is correct because:
- Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are available for pairing.
- Alternating between the largest and smallest elements maximizes the differences between consecutive elements, which in turn maximizes the beauty of the array.

The program correctly handles the edge cases:
- When `n` is even, all elements are paired.
- When `n` is odd, the middle element is added last, which does not affect the maximum beauty calculation since it only appears once in the differences.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
