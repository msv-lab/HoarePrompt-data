### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function `func_1` step by step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with `n` and `arr` and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in `results`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function sorts the array `arr`.
   - It constructs a new array `new_arr` by placing elements in a mirrored order: starting from the last element and then the first element, followed by the second-to-last element and then the second element, and so on.
   - If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` will be the last element in `new_arr`.
   - It calculates the maximum beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

3. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array.
   - It provides a counterexample where the input is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and the expected output is `6`, but the actual output is `4`.

4. **Evaluating the Counterexample:**
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - The function `func_1` constructs `new_arr` as `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.
   - The beauty calculation is:
     - `(4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 3 + 2 + (-1) = 4`.
   - The original assessment claims that the correct maximum beauty should be `6`, which can be achieved by the array `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the beauty of the array, we need to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - One effective way to do this is to sort the array and then place the largest and smallest elements alternately. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - For the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the correct approach would indeed yield the array `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, both of which have a beauty of `6`.

6. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` does exactly this: it sorts the array and then places the largest and smallest elements alternately.
   - Therefore, the function should correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and placing the largest and smallest elements alternately, which maximizes the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
