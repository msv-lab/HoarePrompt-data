Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the last element and then the first element, followed by the second-to-last element and then the second element, and so on. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` will be the last element in `new_arr`, `max_beauty` is 0.**
