Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is 1, `right` is `n - 1`. If `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `left` is incremented by 1, so `left` is now 1.
- The values of `n`, `arr`, and `right` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `new_arr` remains the same: if `left` is equal to `right`, `new_arr` contains the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains the last element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`.
