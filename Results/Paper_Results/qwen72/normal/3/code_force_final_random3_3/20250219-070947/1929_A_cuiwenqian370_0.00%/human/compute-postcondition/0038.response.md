Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `arr` and then constructs a new list `new_arr` by placing the elements in a mirrored order: starting from the last element and then the first element, followed by the second-to-last element and then the second element, and so on. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` will be the last element in `new_arr`. The function returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`. **
