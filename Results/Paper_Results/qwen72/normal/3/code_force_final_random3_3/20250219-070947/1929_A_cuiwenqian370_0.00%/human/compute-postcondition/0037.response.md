The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the mirrored list `new_arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the mirrored list `new_arr`.**
