To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
```

Here, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The variable `i` will start from 1 and go up to `n-1`. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is not explicitly initialized in the state before the loop, but it will be automatically set to 1 by the `range` function when the loop starts.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Given the initial state that `2 <= n <= 100`, this condition is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

The other variables (`arr`, `left`, `right`, `new_arr`, and `max_beauty`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in a mirrored order, starting from the last element and then the first element, followed by the second-to-last element and then the second element, and so on. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `arr` will be the last element in `new_arr`, `max_beauty` is 0, `i` is 1**
