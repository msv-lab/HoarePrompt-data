### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's analyze the program and the problem description to understand why.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program sorts the input array `arr`.
   - It then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted array.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty of `new_arr` by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - After sorting `arr`, the array is in non-decreasing order.
   - The `while` loop constructs `new_arr` by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted array. This means that the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other, followed by the second largest and second smallest, and so on.
   - The `max_beauty` is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach of alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the sorted array is actually a correct strategy to maximize the beauty.
   - By placing the largest and smallest elements next to each other, we ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - For an even-length array, this approach pairs the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on.
   - For an odd-length array, the middle element is placed at the end of the new array, ensuring that the differences are still maximized.

5. **Counterexample Analysis:**
   - The counterexample provided in the original assessment is incorrect.
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the program constructs the new array as `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.
   - The beauty is calculated as:
     \[
     (4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
     \]
   - This is indeed the maximum beauty for this array.

6. **General Case Analysis:**
   - For any sorted array `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`, the approach of alternating elements from the end and the beginning will always maximize the beauty.
   - The absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` will be the largest possible differences, ensuring the maximum beauty.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct and the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
