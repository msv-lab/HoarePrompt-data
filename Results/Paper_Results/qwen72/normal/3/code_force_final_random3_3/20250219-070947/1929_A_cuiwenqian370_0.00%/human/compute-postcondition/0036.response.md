Output State: **The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the mirrored list `new_arr`.** 

In natural language: The program returns a value that represents the total sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the mirrored version of the list `arr`. The mirrored list `new_arr` is created by reversing the order of elements in `arr`. Since `max_beauty` is already calculated as this sum, the program directly returns this value.
