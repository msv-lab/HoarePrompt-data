The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and `test_cases`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `test_cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `test_cases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 1, and `test_cases` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`answers` is a list, `test_cases` must be greater than 1, and `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged. `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. `i` is 1**
