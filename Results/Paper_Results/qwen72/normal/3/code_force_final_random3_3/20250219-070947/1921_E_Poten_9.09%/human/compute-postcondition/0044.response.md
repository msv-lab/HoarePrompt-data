Postcondition: **`answers` is an empty list, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, and either `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd, or `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even. The current value of `clues[3]` is equal to the current value of `clues[5]`.**
