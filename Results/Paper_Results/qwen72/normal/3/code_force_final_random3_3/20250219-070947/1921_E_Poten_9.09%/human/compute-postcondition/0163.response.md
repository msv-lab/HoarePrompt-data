Output State: **`answers` is a list containing the results of all test cases ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') based on the conditions described in the loop, `test_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and the preconditions for `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all the iterations, the `answers` list will contain the results of the test cases, where each result is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', determined by the conditions specified in the loop. The `test_cases` variable will still represent the total number of test cases, and the variables `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
