Postcondition: ***`answers` is a list, `test_cases` must be greater than 1, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged, `i` is 1, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, and if `clues[3] == clues[5]`, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are of different parities, and if `clues[3] == clues[5]`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. In all other cases, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.***
