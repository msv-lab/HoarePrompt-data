Postcondition: **`answers` is either an empty list, a list containing the string 'Bob', or a list containing the string 'Draw'. `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged. `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, with `clues[2]` less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` not equal to 1, and both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` being either even or both odd. If `clues[3] == clues[5]`, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If `clues[3] != clues[5]`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if certain conditions based on the differences between `clues` elements are met, otherwise it contains 'Bob'.**
