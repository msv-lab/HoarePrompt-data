### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases, `test_cases`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The function checks if `x_a > x_b` or `h == 1`. If either condition is true, it appends 'Draw' to the `answers` list. This is because:
     - If `x_a > x_b`, Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, and they cannot meet.
     - If `h == 1`, the board has only one row, and neither player can move, resulting in a draw.

3. **Parity Check**:
   - The function checks the parity (odd or even) of `x_a` and `x_b`. If both have the same parity and `y_a == y_b`, Bob wins because they are in the same column and will meet on Bob's turn.
   - If both have the same parity and `y_a < y_b`, the function checks if the absolute difference in their y-coordinates is greater than 1. If so, it further checks if the difference in y-coordinates is greater than or equal to half the difference in x-coordinates. If either condition is true, it appends 'Draw'; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - If both have the same parity and `y_a > y_b`, the function performs a similar check as above but with the y-coordinates reversed.

4. **Different Parity**:
   - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities and `y_a == y_b`, Alice wins because they are in the same column and will meet on Alice's turn.
   - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities and `y_a < y_b`, the function checks if the absolute difference in their y-coordinates is greater than 1. If so, it further checks if the difference in y-coordinates is greater than or equal to half the difference in x-coordinates. If either condition is true, it appends 'Draw'; otherwise, Alice wins.
   - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities and `y_a > y_b`, the function performs a similar check as above but with the y-coordinates reversed.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the function prints the results stored in the `answers` list.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The logic for determining the outcome of the game is based on the relative positions of Alice's and Bob's chips and the parity of their x-coordinates.
- The conditions for a draw, Alice's win, and Bob's win are correctly implemented based on the problem description.
- The function correctly handles the edge cases where the board has only one row or the chips are initially in positions where they cannot meet.

### Potential Issues:

- The function does not handle the case where `x_a == x_b` and `y_a != y_b` explicitly, but this is covered by the parity checks and the conditions for drawing or winning.
- The function does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem description that requires printing the results.

### Conclusion:

The function appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given problem description and the provided test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
