Output State: **`answers` is a list, `test_cases` must be greater than 2, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged, `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `clues`. The other variables (`answers`, `test_cases`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t`) remain unchanged, and the value of `i` is still 2.
