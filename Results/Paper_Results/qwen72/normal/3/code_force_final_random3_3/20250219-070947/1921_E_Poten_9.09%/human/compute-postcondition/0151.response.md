The string 'Draw' is appended to the list `answers`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, `t`, `i`, and `clues`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `answers` is a list with an additional element 'Draw', `test_cases` must be greater than 2, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged, `i` is 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user.
