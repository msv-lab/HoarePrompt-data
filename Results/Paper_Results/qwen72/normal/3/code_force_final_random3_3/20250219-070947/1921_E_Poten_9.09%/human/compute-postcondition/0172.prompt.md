You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method or variable, as the function definition provided does not include any parameters. However, based on the problem description, the input should consist of multiple test cases, each containing six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b, where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

    #State: `answers` is a list containing the results of all test cases ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') based on the conditions described in the loop, `test_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and the preconditions for `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    for j in answers:
        print(j)
        
    #State: All results in the `answers` list have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each containing six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints and relationships between the input values.
