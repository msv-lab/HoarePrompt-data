Postcondition: ***`answers` is an empty list or a list containing either the string 'Draw' or 'Bob'. `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged. `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, with `clues[2]` less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` not equal to 1, both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` being either even or both odd, `clues[3]` greater than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` being greater than 1. If either the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.***
