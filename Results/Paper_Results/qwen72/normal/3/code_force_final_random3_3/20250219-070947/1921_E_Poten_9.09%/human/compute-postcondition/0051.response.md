Postcondition: **`answers` is an empty list, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, and `t` remain unchanged, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, and either `clues[2]` is even and `clues[4]` is odd, or `clues[2]` is odd and `clues[4]` is even. Additionally, `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. The condition `(clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is false.**
