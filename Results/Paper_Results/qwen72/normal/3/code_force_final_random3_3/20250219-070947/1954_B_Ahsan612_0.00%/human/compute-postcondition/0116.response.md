Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
   - `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `minn` is the minimum of the original `minn` and 1, and `minn` is currently equal to `inf`.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `minn`, and `num` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - The statement `print(-1)` will always print `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
