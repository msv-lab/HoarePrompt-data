The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it is being compared to the length of `ar`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is 1
- `ar` is a list of integers input by the user

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` (which is 1) must be less than the length of `ar`. This means that `ar` must have at least 2 elements (since `i` starts at 1, and the loop condition is `i < len(ar)`).

Since `i` is already 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`. The only thing to ensure is that `ar` has at least 2 elements. However, since `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, we cannot adjust the length of `ar` directly. Instead, we can state that the condition for the loop to execute is that `ar` must have at least 2 elements.

Therefore, the state that ensures the loop can execute the first time is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1**
