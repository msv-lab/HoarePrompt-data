Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, `same` is 1, and `ar[i]` is not equal to the previous `num` (which was the first element of `ar`).**

Explanation: The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to the minimum of its current value (`inf`) and the value of `same` (which is 1). Since 1 is less than `inf`, `minn` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
