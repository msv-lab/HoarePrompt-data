Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `i` is 4, `same` is 1, `minn` is 2 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `minn` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[3]` if `ar[1]` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `num` is updated to `ar[4]`.**
