Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in `ar` that was encountered during the loop, and `same` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer.
- The list `a` remains a list of integers of length `n` where each element is between 1 and `n`.
- The list `ar` remains a list of integers input by the user, and it must have at least 2 elements.
- The variable `i` is now equal to the length of `ar`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `num` is updated to the last element of `ar`.
- The variable `minn` is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements encountered in the list `ar` during the loop execution.
- The variable `same` is reset to 1, as it is updated to 1 whenever a new element is encountered in the list `ar`.
