Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `minn` is 1, `same` is 1, and the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**

The code snippet `same = 1` initializes the variable `same` to 1. This does not affect any of the other variables or their values, so the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the `same` variable.
