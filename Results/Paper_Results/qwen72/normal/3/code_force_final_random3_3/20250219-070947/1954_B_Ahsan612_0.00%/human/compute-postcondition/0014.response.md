Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`.**

The code snippet `same = 1` has no effect on the initial state because `same` was already set to 1. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged in the output state.
