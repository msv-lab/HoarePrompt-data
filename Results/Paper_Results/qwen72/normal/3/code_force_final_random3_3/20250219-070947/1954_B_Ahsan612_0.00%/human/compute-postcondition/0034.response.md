Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1, and `same` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.
- Since `same` is 1, `minn` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ar`, `i`, `num`) remain unchanged.
