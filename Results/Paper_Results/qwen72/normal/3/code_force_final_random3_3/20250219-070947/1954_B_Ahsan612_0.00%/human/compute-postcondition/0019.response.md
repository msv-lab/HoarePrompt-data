The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first or second element of `ar`, and `minn` is either 1 or infinity.**
