Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements in `ar`. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` is not equal to `inf`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `ar` to a new list of integers input by the user.
- The length of `ar` is now the number of integers input by the user, so `i` is updated to `len(ar)`.
- The last element of `ar` is now the last integer in the user input, so `num` is updated to the last element of `ar`.
- The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, but since `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements in the new `ar`, it might change.
- The rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- If `minn` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf` unless `same` is less than `inf`, in which case `minn` is updated to `same`.
- If `minn` was not `inf`, it is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `same`.
