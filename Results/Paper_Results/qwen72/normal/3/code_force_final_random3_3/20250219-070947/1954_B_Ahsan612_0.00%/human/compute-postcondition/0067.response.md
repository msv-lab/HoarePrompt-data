Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, and `len(ar)` must be greater than the current value of `i`**. 

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `i` is incremented by 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than the current value of `i`. The code snippet `i += 1` further increments `i` by 1. Therefore, `i` is now incremented by a total of 2 from its original value, and the condition that `len(ar)` must be greater than the current value of `i` still holds.
