Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `same` is 1, and `num` is the last element of `ar`. If `minn` was initially equal to infinity, `minn` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum of the original `minn` and 1, and is not equal to infinity.***
