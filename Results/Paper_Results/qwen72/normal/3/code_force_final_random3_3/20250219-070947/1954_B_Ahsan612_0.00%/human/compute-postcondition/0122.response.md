Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `ar` of length `n`. It then finds the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements in `ar`. If no such sequence exists, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program includes the number of test cases `t`, the number of elements `n` for the last test case, the list `ar` of integers input for the last test case, and the variables `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same` which are updated during the processing of the last test case. **
