Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (1 <= x < n <= 10^9) and returns a list containing the divisors of `x` in a specific order. The list includes all divisors of `x` found by iterating from 1 to the square root of `x`, with the smaller divisors in ascending order followed by the larger divisors in descending order. The function does not modify the input `x` or any other variables outside its scope. **
