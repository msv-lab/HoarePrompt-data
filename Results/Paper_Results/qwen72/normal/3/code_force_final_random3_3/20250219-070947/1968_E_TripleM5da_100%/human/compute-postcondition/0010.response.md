Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is n - 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - 1`. This is because the loop starts at `i = 3` and increments `i` by 1 until `i` reaches `n + 1`, but the loop body is executed for `i` values from 3 up to and including `n`. Therefore, the last value of `i` that is printed and the loop variable `i` will be `n - 1` after the loop completes. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
