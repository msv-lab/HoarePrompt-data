### Reasoning:

The given program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program's approach is to print the following points for each test case:
- (1, 1)
- (1, 2)
- (i, i) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\)

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

1. **Initial Points (1, 1) and (1, 2):**
   - The first two points are (1, 1) and (1, 2). The Manhattan distance between these two points is \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).

2. **Diagonal Points (i, i) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\):**
   - The program then prints points on the diagonal of the grid starting from (3, 3) to (n, n).
   - The Manhattan distance between any two diagonal points \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) is \(|i-j| + |i-j| = 2|i-j|\). This means the distances are even and range from 2 to \(2(n-3)\).

3. **Combining Distances:**
   - The distances between the initial points (1, 1) and (1, 2) and the diagonal points are:
     - From (1, 1) to (i, i): \(|1-i| + |1-i| = 2|i-1|\)
     - From (1, 2) to (i, i): \(|1-i| + |2-i| = |1-i| + |i-2| = |1-i| + |i-2| = 2|i-1.5| - 1\)
   - These distances include both even and odd values, ensuring a wide range of distinct distances.

4. **Maximizing the Set \(\mathcal{H}\):**
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will include:
     - 0 (distance between any point and itself)
     - 1 (distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2))
     - Even distances from 2 to \(2(n-3)\) (distances between diagonal points)
     - Odd distances from 1 to \(2(n-2) - 1\) (distances between (1, 1) or (1, 2) and diagonal points)
   - This approach ensures that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains a large number of distinct distances, which is the goal.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \(n = 2\), the program correctly outputs (1, 1) and (1, 2), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), the maximum possible size.
   - For \(n = 3\), the program outputs (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), the maximum possible size.

### Conclusion:
The program's approach is correct for maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. It ensures that the set contains a wide range of both even and odd distances, which is sufficient to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

### Correctness:
**True**
