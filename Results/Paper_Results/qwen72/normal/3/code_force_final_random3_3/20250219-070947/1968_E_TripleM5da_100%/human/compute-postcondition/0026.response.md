To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50 (This variable is not in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `n` is an integer greater than the initial value of `n` (This is a bit confusing, but we can interpret it as `n` being some integer value).
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop `for i in range(3, n + 1):` will execute if the range `range(3, n + 1)` contains at least one value.
   - The range `range(3, n + 1)` will contain at least one value if `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `i` should be 3 at the start of the loop to align with the loop head.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 to ensure the loop has at least one iteration.

Given these points, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3**
