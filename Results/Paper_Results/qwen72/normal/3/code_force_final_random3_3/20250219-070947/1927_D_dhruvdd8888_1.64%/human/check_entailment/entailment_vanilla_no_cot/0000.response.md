Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Function Call Issue**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called within the loop that processes each test case, but the function itself is defined outside the loop. This means that `ppp` is not defined within `func_1()`, which will cause an error when the program tries to access it.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Pair Finding**:
   - The logic for finding the pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i != a_j` is flawed. The program uses a list `arr` to store ranges of consecutive equal elements, but it does not correctly handle the case where the query range `(l, r)` spans multiple ranges of different elements.
   - The program assumes that if the start of a range is greater than `l`, then the previous element is a valid pair. This is not always correct, as the previous element might not be within the query range.
   - Similarly, the program assumes that if the end of a range is less than `r`, then the next element is a valid pair. This is also not always correct, as the next element might not be within the query range.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if all elements in the array are the same, the program might incorrectly output a pair of indices that are not within the query range.

4. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**:
   - The `bisect_left` function is used to find the position in `arr` where the query range starts. However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the query range starts or ends within a range of equal elements.

5. **Unnecessary Conditions**:
   - The conditions `if tc > 5` and `if ppp == 23` are unnecessary and do not contribute to solving the problem. They are likely debugging statements that should be removed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Preprocess the array to store the first and last occurrence of each element.
- For each query, check if there are any different elements within the range `(l, r)` by comparing the first and last occurrences of elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import sys

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        queries = []
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            queries.append((l, r))
            index += 2
        
        # Preprocess the array to store the first and last occurrence of each element
        first_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
        last_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
        for i in range(n):
            if first_occurrence[nums[i]] == -1:
                first_occurrence[nums[i]] = i + 1
            last_occurrence[nums[i]] = i + 1
        
        # Process each query
        for l, r in queries:
            found = False
            for i in range(l, r + 1):
                if first_occurrence[nums[i - 1]] < l or last_occurrence[nums[i - 1]] > r:
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                results.append(f"{l} {r}")
            else:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

func_1()
```

This version correctly preprocesses the array and checks each query to find a pair of different elements or report that no such pair exists.
