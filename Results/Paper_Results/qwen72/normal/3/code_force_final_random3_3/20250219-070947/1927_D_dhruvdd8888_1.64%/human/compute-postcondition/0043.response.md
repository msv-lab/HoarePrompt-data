Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`N` is greater than or equal to 0**: This means `N` is a non-negative integer.
2. **`i` is `N`**: `i` is initialized to the value of `N`.
3. **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end**: This means `nums` is a list of integers where the last element is always `-1`.
4. **`num` is `-1`**: `num` is initialized to `-1`.
5. **`s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`**: This means `s` is the index of the element just before the last `-1` in `nums`.
6. **`arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`**: `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. The first element of each tuple is `1 + s`, the second element is `i`, and the third element is `num` (which is `-1`).
7. **`LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1**: `LA` is the index of the last element in `arr`.
8. **`l` and `r` are input integers**: These are additional integers provided as input.
9. **`eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`**: `eli` is the index of the first tuple in `arr` whose first element is greater than or equal to `l`.
10. **`s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`**: `s` is updated to the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
11. **`e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`**: `e` is updated to the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
12. **`ppp` is 23 if `tc` is greater than 5**: This is not relevant to the print statement, so we can ignore it.
13. **`s` is greater than `l` and `s` is not equal to 1**: This means the updated `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(s - 1, s)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s` and `e`**:
   - `eli` is the index of the first tuple in `arr` whose first element is greater than or equal to `l`.
   - `min(eli, LA)` ensures that we don't go out of bounds if `eli` is greater than `LA`.
   - `s` is updated to the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e` is updated to the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will output `s - 1` and `s`.

### Final Output:
Given the conditions:
- `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1.
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

The print statement will output:
Output: **(s - 1, s) (where s is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and s is greater than `l` and not equal to 1)**
