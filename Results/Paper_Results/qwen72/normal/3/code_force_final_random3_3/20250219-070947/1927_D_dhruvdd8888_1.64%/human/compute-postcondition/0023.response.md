Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `num` is now the integer value of `nums[2]`. If `nums[2]` is not equal to the first integer in the list `nums`, `s` is 2, `e` is 0, and `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 2, nums[2])`. Otherwise, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, and `arr` is an empty list.**
