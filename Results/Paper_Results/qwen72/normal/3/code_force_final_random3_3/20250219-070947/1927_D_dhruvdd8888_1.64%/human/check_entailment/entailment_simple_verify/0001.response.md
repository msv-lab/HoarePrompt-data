### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case using `for ppp in range(tc):`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`, which is appropriate for the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends a dummy value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases. This is a common technique to ensure the loop processes the last segment of the array.

3. **Grouping Consecutive Elements:**
   - The loop `for i in range(N + 1):` checks if the current element `nums[i]` is different from the previous element `num`.
   - If they are different, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr`, which represents the range `[1 + s, i - 1]` where all elements are equal to `num`.
   - It then updates `s` to the current index `i` and `num` to `nums[i]`.
   - This part of the code correctly groups consecutive equal elements and stores the ranges in `arr`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries and processes each query.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)` and uses `bisect_left` to find the first range in `arr` that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the range to determine if a pair of different elements exists within the query range `(l, r)`.

5. **Output:**
   - If the start of the range `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is 1. If so, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair). Otherwise, it prints `s - 1, s` (a valid pair).
   - If the end of the range `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).
   - If the end of the range `e` is less than `N`, it prints `s, e + 1` (a valid pair).
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).

### Issues and Concerns:
1. **Redundant Input Reading:**
   - The function `func_1` redefines `input` as `sys.stdin.readline`, which is unnecessary and can lead to confusion. The `input` function should be used directly or a different name should be used for `sys.stdin.readline`.

2. **Incorrect Range Handling:**
   - The program appends a dummy value `-1` to `nums` to handle edge cases, but this can lead to incorrect results if the last element of `nums` is also `-1`. However, since the problem guarantees that the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`, and the elements are between `1` and `10^6`, the last element being `-1` is highly unlikely and can be considered a safe assumption.
   - The logic for determining the range and checking the conditions is not robust. For example, the condition `if s > l` and `if e >= r` may not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the condition `if s > l` is too strict and may miss valid pairs if `s` is exactly `l`.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program has some debug prints and special conditions for `ppp == 23` and `tc > 5`, which are not necessary for the problem and can be removed.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm does not correctly handle all possible query ranges. For example, if the query range `(l, r)` is entirely within a single group of equal elements, it will incorrectly print `-1 -1` even if there are different elements outside the group.
   - The program should check if the query range `(l, r)` spans multiple segments in `arr` to ensure it finds a valid pair of different elements.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program does not correctly handle all possible query ranges and may miss valid pairs of different elements. The logic for finding pairs of different elements is not robust and can lead to incorrect outputs.

Final: **False**
