Let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is set to `N`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end.
   - `num` is `-1`.
   - `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
   - `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.
   - `tc` is greater than 5.
   - `ppp` is 23.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is set to `N`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers where the last element is guaranteed to be `-1`.
   - `num` is `-1`.
   - `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`. This means `s` is the index of the element just before the `-1` in `nums`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples, each representing a segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`. Each tuple is of the form `(1 + s, i, num)`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers, and their values are not specified in the initial state.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(l, r)`.
   - This statement will print the values of `l` and `r`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `l` and `r` are input integers, their exact values are not known from the initial state.
   - However, the `print` statement will output the values of `l` and `r` as they are provided by the user.

Therefore, the output will be the values of `l` and `r` as they are input by the user.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are input integers)**
