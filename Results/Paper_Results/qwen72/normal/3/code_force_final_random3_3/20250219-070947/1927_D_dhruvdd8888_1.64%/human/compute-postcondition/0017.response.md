Postcondition: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, num)`, otherwise `arr` is an empty list.**
