Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
2. `i` is `N`.
3. `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end.
4. `num` is `-1`.
5. `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
6. `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.
7. `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
8. `l` and `r` are input integers.
9. `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
10. `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
11. `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
12. `ppp` is 23 if `tc` is greater than 5, and `s` is less than or equal to `l`. Additionally, `e` is not less than `N`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
- The values `-1` and `-1` are constants and do not depend on any variables or conditions from the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output `-1, -1` regardless of the values of `N`, `i`, `nums`, `num`, `s`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, or `ppp`.

Output: **-1, -1**
