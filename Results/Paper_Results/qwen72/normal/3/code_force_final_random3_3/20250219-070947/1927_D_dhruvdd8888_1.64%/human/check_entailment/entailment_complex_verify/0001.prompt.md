You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array a of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) where each element a_i is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and q queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5). Each query is defined by two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    LA = len(arr) - 1

If `ppp` is 23, the postcondition remains unchanged.

    #State: The values of `N`, `i`, `nums`, `num`, `s`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `LA` remains the length of `arr` minus 1. The loop iterates a number of times specified by the input integer. For each iteration, `l` and `r` are updated with new input integers. `eli` is updated to the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`. `s` and `e` are updated to the first and second elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. If `tc` is greater than 5 and `ppp` is 23, the loop prints `l` and `r`. If `s` is greater than `l`, the loop prints `s - 1` and `s` if `s` is not 1, otherwise it prints `-1, -1`. If `s` is less than or equal to `l` and `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the loop prints `-1, -1`. If `s` is less than or equal to `l` and `e` is less than `r` and `e` is less than `N`, the loop prints `s` and `e + 1`. If `s` is less than or equal to `l` and `e` is less than `r` and `e` is not less than `N`, the loop prints `-1, -1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `nums` from the standard input, processes the list to identify segments of consecutive identical numbers, and then handles a series of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, the function outputs a pair of indices indicating the boundaries of the segment that contains `l` and `r` or `-1, -1` if the segment does not exist or the conditions are not met. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case using `for ppp in range(tc):`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends a dummy value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It then iterates over the array to group consecutive equal elements and stores the ranges and values in `arr`.

3. **Grouping Consecutive Elements:**
   - The loop `for i in range(N + 1):` checks if the current element `nums[i]` is different from the previous element `num`.
   - If they are different, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr`, which represents the range `[1 + s, i - 1]` where all elements are equal to `num`.
   - It then updates `s` to the current index `i` and `num` to `nums[i]`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries and processes each query.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)` and uses `bisect_left` to find the first range in `arr` that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the range to determine if a pair of different elements exists within the query range `(l, r)`.

5. **Output:**
   - If the start of the range `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is 1. If so, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair). Otherwise, it prints `s - 1, s` (a valid pair).
   - If the end of the range `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).
   - If the end of the range `e` is less than `N`, it prints `s, e + 1` (a valid pair).
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).

### Issues and Concerns:
1. **Redundant Input Reading:**
   - The function `func_1` redefines `input` as `sys.stdin.readline`, which is unnecessary and can lead to confusion. The `input` function should be used directly or a different name should be used for `sys.stdin.readline`.

2. **Incorrect Range Handling:**
   - The program appends a dummy value `-1` to `nums` to handle edge cases, but this can lead to incorrect results if the last element of `nums` is also `-1`.
   - The logic for determining the range and checking the conditions is not robust. For example, the condition `if s > l` and `if e >= r` may not correctly handle all cases.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program has some debug prints and special conditions for `ppp == 23` and `tc > 5`, which are not necessary for the problem and can be removed.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm does not correctly handle all possible query ranges. For example, if the query range `(l, r)` is entirely within a single group of equal elements, it will incorrectly print `-1 -1` even if there are different elements outside the group.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues that affect its correctness, particularly in how it handles query ranges and edge cases. The logic for finding pairs of different elements is not robust and can lead to incorrect outputs.
