Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is `N`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end.
   - `num` is `-1`.
   - `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
   - `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `ppp` is 23 if `tc` is greater than 5. (Note: `tc` is not defined in the initial state, so we can ignore this part as it does not affect the print statement.)

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `s` is greater than `l`, then `s` is greater than `l`.
   - If `s` is 1, the current value of `s` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `s` is greater than 1.
   - If `s` is less than or equal to `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - If `e` is less than `r` and `e` is less than `N`, then `e` is less than `r`.
   - If `e` is less than `r` and `e` is not less than `N`, then `e` is not less than `N`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(l, r)`.

Given the initial state and conditions, the values of `l` and `r` are input integers. The conditions provided do not change the values of `l` and `r` directly. Therefore, the print statement will simply output the values of `l` and `r` as they were input.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the input integers)**
