Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `nums` from the standard input, processes the list to identify segments of consecutive identical numbers, and then handles a series of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, the function outputs a pair of indices indicating the boundaries of the segment that contains `l` and `r` or `-1, -1` if the segment does not exist or the conditions are not met. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. **
