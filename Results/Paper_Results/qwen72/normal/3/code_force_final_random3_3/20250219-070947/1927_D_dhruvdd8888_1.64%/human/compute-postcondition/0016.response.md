Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 1, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, num)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 1.
- All other variables (`N`, `i`, `nums`, `e`, `num`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
