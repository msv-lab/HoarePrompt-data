Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`N` is greater than or equal to 0**: This means `N` is a non-negative integer.
2. **`i` is `N`**: `i` is initialized to the value of `N`.
3. **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end**: This means `nums` is a list of integers where the last element is always `-1`.
4. **`num` is `-1`**: `num` is a constant value of `-1`.
5. **`s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`**: This means `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` before the `-1`.
6. **`arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`**: This means `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. The first element of each tuple is `1 + s`, the second element is `i`, and the third element is `num` (which is `-1`).
7. **`LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1**: `LA` is the index of the last element in `arr`.
8. **`l` and `r` are input integers**: These are additional integers provided as input.
9. **`eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`**: This means `eli` is the index of the first tuple in `arr` where the first element of the tuple is greater than or equal to `l`.
10. **`s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`**: This means `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
11. **`e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`**: This means `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
12. **`_` is the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`**: This means `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`, which is always `-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s, e + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s` and `e`**:
   - `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - Since `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)`, the first element of each tuple is `1 + s` and the second element is `i`.

2. **Determine the value of `s`**:
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - Given the form of the tuples in `arr`, `s` will be `1 + s` from the tuple.

3. **Determine the value of `e`**:
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - Given the form of the tuples in `arr`, `e` will be `i` from the tuple.

4. **Determine the value of `e + 1`**:
   - Since `e` is `i`, `e + 1` will be `i + 1`.

### Final Output:
The `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, which is `1 + s`, and the second element of the tuple plus 1, which is `i + 1`.

Output: **1 + s, i + 1 (where `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1` and `i` is the value of `N`)**
