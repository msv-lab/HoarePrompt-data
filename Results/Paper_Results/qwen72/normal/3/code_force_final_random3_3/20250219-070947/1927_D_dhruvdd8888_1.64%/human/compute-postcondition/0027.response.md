To determine what will be printed by the `print(nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformations applied to `nums`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is set to `N`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end.
   - `num` is set to `-1`.
   - `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
   - `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `ppp` is 23.

2. **Understanding `nums`:**
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, and with `-1` appended to the end.
   - For example, if the input is `1 2 2 3 3 3`, then `nums` will be `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, -1]`.

3. **Understanding `s`:**
   - `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
   - In the example `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, -1]`, `s` would be 6 (the index of the last element before `-1`).

4. **Understanding `arr`:**
   - `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.
   - In the example `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, -1]`, the segments are:
     - `1` (index 0)
     - `2, 2` (index 1 to 2)
     - `3, 3, 3` (index 3 to 5)
   - The corresponding tuples in `arr` would be:
     - `(1 + 0, N, -1)` for the segment starting at index 0
     - `(1 + 2, N, -1)` for the segment starting at index 1
     - `(1 + 5, N, -1)` for the segment starting at index 3

5. **Understanding `LA`:**
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - In the example, `arr` would have 3 tuples, so `LA` would be 2.

6. **Understanding `ppp`:**
   - `ppp` is 23, but it is not used in the `print(nums)` statement.

Given the initial state and the transformations, the `print(nums)` statement will print the list `nums` as it was constructed from the input with `-1` appended to the end.

Output: **[list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with -1 appended to the end]**

For instance, if the input was `1 2 2 3 3 3`, the output would be:
Output: **[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, -1]**
