Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is set to `N`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, split by spaces, with `-1` appended to the end.
   - `num` is `-1`.
   - `s` is the index of the last element in `nums` that is not `-1`.
   - `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` before the `-1`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `_` is the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement explicitly prints `-1, -1`.
   - The values of `s`, `e`, and `_` are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `-1, -1` regardless of the values of `N`, `i`, `nums`, `num`, `s`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, or `_`.

Output: **-1, -1**
