Output State: **The function is now set up to read input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline`. The initial state regarding the test cases, arrays, and queries remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.readline` reassigns the `input` function to read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline`.
- This change affects how input is read, but does not alter the values of `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, or `r` as they are not directly modified by this line of code.
- The constraints and conditions specified in the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
