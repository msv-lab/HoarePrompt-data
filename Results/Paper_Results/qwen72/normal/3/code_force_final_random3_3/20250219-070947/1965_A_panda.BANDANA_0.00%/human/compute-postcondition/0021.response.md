Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the new input, `e` is a set containing the unique elements from the new `l`, `m` is the length of the new `l`. If `1` is in the new `l`, the list `l` contains the integer 1. Otherwise, `1` is not in the new `l`.**

The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `l` to a new list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `e`, `m`) and conditions remain unchanged. The new list `l` will contain the integers input by the user, and the set `e` will contain the unique elements from this new list `l`. The length of the new list `l` will be stored in `m`. If `1` is in the new list `l`, then `1` is present in the list. Otherwise, `1` is not in the list.
