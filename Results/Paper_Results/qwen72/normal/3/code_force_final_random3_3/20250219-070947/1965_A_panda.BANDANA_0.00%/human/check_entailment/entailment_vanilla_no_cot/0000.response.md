Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all test cases. The logic in the program is too simplistic and only checks if there is a pile with 1 stone. If there is, it assumes Bob will win, and if not, it assumes Alice will win. However, this logic is incorrect because the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

### Correct Logic:
To determine the winner, you need to count the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If this count is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because:

- If the number of odd piles is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of odd piles for Bob, and vice versa.
- If the number of odd piles is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice will eventually be the one to face an odd number of odd piles.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        odd_count = sum(1 for x in l if x % 2 == 1)
        if odd_count % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the winner for all test cases based on the problem description.
