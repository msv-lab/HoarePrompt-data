Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have two installations launching fireworks at intervals of `a` and `b` minutes, respectively.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It then calculates and prints `m // a + m // b + 2`.

3. **Evaluating the Calculation**:
   - `m // a` gives the number of times the first installation can launch a firework within `m` minutes.
   - `m // b` gives the number of times the second installation can launch a firework within `m` minutes.
   - Adding these two values together gives the total number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes.
   - The `+ 2` part is incorrect because it does not account for the visibility overlap correctly.

4. **Correct Calculation**:
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the overlap of the visibility periods.
   - The visibility period of a firework launched at time `x` is from `x` to `x + m`.
   - We need to find the maximum overlap of these periods.
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time can be determined by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM of `a` and `b` gives the interval at which both installations launch a firework simultaneously.
   - The number of fireworks visible at the same time is the number of such intervals within `m + 1` minutes plus one (for the initial launch).

5. **Corrected Program**:
   - The corrected program should calculate the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
   - Here is the corrected program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_visible = (m + 1) // l + 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
   - The original program adds 2 to the sum of the number of launches within `m` minutes, which is incorrect.
   - The corrected program uses the LCM to find the maximum overlap and correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

Final: **False**
