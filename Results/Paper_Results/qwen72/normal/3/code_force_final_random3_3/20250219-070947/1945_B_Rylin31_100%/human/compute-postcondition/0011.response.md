The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `a`, `b`, and `m` such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. The function is expected to return a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

However, since the exact output is not provided, we can infer that the function likely performs some operation involving `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case and returns the results. Given the constraints, a common operation could be a modular arithmetic operation, but without the specific output details, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
