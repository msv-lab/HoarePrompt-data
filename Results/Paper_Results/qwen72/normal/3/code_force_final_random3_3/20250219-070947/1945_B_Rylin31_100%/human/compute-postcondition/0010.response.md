Output State: **`t` iterations have completed, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value `t-1` (since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration), and the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` will have been set to the input integers for the last iteration of the loop. The loop will have printed the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` for each of the `t` test cases.
