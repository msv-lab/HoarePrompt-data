Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.**

The code snippet `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of three input integers to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 1, which remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are now the input integers provided by the user.
