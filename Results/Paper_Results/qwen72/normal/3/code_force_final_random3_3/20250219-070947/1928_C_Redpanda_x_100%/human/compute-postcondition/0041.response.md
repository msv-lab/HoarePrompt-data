Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and the loop has yielded all values of the form `factor * primes[k]^i` for each `factor` in `rest` and for `i` ranging from 0 to `factors[prime]`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the following will be true:
- `k` is still a non-negative integer within the bounds of the `primes` list.
- `primes` remains a list of prime numbers.
- `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable.
- `prime` is still equal to `primes[k]`.
- The loop has generated and yielded all possible products of each `factor` in `rest` multiplied by `primes[k]` raised to the power of `i`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `factors[prime]` inclusive. This means that for each `factor` in `rest`, the loop has produced `factor * primes[k]^0`, `factor * primes[k]^1`, ..., up to `factor * primes[k]^(factors[prime])`.
