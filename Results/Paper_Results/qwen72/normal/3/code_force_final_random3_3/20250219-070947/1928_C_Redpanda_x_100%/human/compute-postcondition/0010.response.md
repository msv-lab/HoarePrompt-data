The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `factors[prime]`. The loop will execute one more time if the condition `_ in range(factors[prime] + 1)` is still true. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * 1`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, and a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` must be incremented by 1, and `factors[prime] + 1` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `factors[prime]` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again (since `_` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration).

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * 1`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 1, a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, `_` is 1**
