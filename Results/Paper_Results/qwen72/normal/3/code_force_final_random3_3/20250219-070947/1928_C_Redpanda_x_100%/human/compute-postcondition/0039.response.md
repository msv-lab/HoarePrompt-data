Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i * prime`, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 1, `_` is 2, and a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation:
- The value of `prime_to_i` is updated by multiplying it with `prime`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The new value of `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime_to_i * prime`.
