You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where the first \( k \) people in a line are numbered \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k \), the next \( k-2 \) people are numbered \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \), and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given constraints for a specific position \( n \) and number \( x \).

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - For a given position \( n \), the number \( x \) received by Vasya can be determined by the position within the repeating cycle.
   - The position within the cycle can be calculated as \( n \mod (2k-2) \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - \( k > 1 \)
   - \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \)

4. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function is intended to find the factors of \( n \) and then generate all possible factors of \( n \).
   - However, the function is incomplete and does not correctly handle the generation of factors. The `generate` function is called with an incorrect argument (`0`), and the `primes` list is not defined within the scope of `func_1`.

5. **Function 2 (`generate`):**
   - This function is a recursive generator that yields all possible factors of a number given its prime factorization.
   - The function is correctly implemented but relies on the `primes` and `factors` variables, which are not properly defined or passed in the context of `func_1`.

6. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.
   - The `func_1` function does not correctly handle the generation of factors and the `generate` function is not called with the correct arguments.
   - The program does not address the specific problem of determining the number of valid \( k \) values for a given \( n \) and \( x \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect and incomplete. It does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
