The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `factors[prime] + 1`. Therefore, we can only adjust these states.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes)
- `primes` is a list of prime numbers
- `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element
- `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`
- `factor` is the next element of `rest`
- `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k]`
- `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer
- A value `factor * 1` has been yielded

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop condition must still be true. The loop condition is `_` in `range(factors[prime] + 1)`. This means that the loop will execute `factors[prime] + 1` times. After the last iteration, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `factors[prime] + 1`.

Since `_` is not explicitly tracked in the state, we can infer that the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `factors[prime] + 1` must still be greater than the current value of `_`.

Given that `_` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `factors[prime]` remains the same

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `_` is incremented by 1, and a value `factor * 1` has been yielded.**
