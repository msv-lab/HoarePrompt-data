Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `generate` are not designed to handle the specific requirements of the problem, which involves determining the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position and the number he received.

The problem requires a function that takes two inputs, \( n \) and \( x \), and returns the number of different \( k \) values that fit the described settling pattern. The provided functions do not perform this task. Instead, they seem to be generating factors of a number, which is not directly related to the problem at hand.

For example, consider the input \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \). The correct output should be 4, as \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) are suitable. However, the provided program does not compute this result. It lacks the logic to determine the valid \( k \) values based on the settling pattern described in the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
