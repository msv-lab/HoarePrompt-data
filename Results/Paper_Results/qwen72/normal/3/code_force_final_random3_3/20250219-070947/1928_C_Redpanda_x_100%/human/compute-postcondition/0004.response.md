Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`.** 

In natural language: The variable `k` remains a non-negative integer within the range of the length of the `primes` list. The `primes` list is still a list of prime numbers. The variable `rest` still holds the result of the function `generate(k + 1)`. The new variable `prime` is now equal to the `k`-th element in the `primes` list.
