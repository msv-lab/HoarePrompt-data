Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation:
- The value of `prime_to_i` is updated by multiplying it with `prime`.
- The value of `prime` remains `primes[k]`.
- The other variables (`k`, `primes`, `rest`, `factor`, `factors[prime]`, `_`) and their conditions remain unchanged.
- The value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, but the specific value of `factor` and `prime_to_i` are not provided, so we describe it in terms of the variables.
