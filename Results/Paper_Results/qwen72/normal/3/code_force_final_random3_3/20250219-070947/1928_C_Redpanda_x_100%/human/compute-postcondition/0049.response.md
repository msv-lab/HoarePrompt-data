Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factors of `n` and their respective highest powers, `nn` is 1, `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > n`, `primes` is a list of the prime factors of `n`, `factor` is the third value yielded by `generate(0)`, and the third value of `factor` has been yielded. The third value of `factor` has been yielded again.**
