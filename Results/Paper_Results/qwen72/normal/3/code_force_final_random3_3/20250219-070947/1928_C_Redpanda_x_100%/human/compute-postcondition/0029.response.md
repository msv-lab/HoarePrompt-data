The only objects in the loop head are `factor` and `rest`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `rest` having more elements. At the end of the last iteration, `rest` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, and `factor` is the next element of `rest`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `rest` must still have at least one more element, and `factor` will be the next element of `rest`.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `primes[k]` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, and the loop has yielded values `factor * primes[k]^0`, `factor * primes[k]^1`, ..., `factor * primes[k]^(factors[prime])`**
