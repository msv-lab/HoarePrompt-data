The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 and `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24.
- `i` is `n`.

For the loop to execute, `i` must start from 1, and `n` must be at least 1. Since `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 24, it meets the requirement. However, `i` needs to be adjusted to start from 1.

State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1**
