Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer provided by the user such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
- `i` is 1.
- `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `nx` is a string of length `n`. Each character in `nx` is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[i]` at index `j - 1`. If the character is not '?', it is appended directly to `nx`. If the character is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nx)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `i` and `j`**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.

2. **Construction of `nx`**:
   - `nx` is a string of length `n`.
   - For each character in `nx` at position `k` (where \(0 \leq k < n\)):
     - The character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[i]` at index `j - 1`.
     - If the character is not '?', it is appended directly to `nx`.
     - If the character is '?':
       - Check if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.
       - If either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, append 'F' to `nx`.
       - Otherwise, append 'S' to `nx`.

3. **Understanding `i` and `j`**:
   - `i` is always 1.
   - `j` is always `n + 1`.

4. **Understanding `sa`**:
   - `sa` is a list of indices where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0.
   - The first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` are the indices that are considered for the 'F' condition.

5. **Character Determination**:
   - For each position `k` in `nx`:
     - The character is determined by `xx[1][n + 1 - 1]`, which simplifies to `xx[1][n]`.
     - If `xx[1][n]` is not '?', it is appended directly to `nx`.
     - If `xx[1][n]` is '?':
       - Check if `1` or `n + 1` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.
       - Since `j` is `n + 1`, it is always out of bounds for the list `sa` (which has indices from 1 to `n`).
       - Therefore, the condition simplifies to checking if `1` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - If `xx[1][n]` is not '?', `nx` will be a string of length `n` with the character `xx[1][n]` repeated `n` times.
   - If `xx[1][n]` is '?':
     - If `1` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` will be a string of length `n` with 'F' repeated `n` times.
     - Otherwise, `nx` will be a string of length `n` with 'S' repeated `n` times.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `xx`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n, and each character is determined by the rules: if xx[1][n] is not '?', it is repeated n times; if xx[1][n] is '?', and 1 is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa, 'F' is repeated n times; otherwise, 'S' is repeated n times)**.
