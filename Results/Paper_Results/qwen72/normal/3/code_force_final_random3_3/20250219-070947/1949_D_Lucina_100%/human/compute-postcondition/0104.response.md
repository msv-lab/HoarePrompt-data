Output State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `xx` contains `n` strings, each string being one of the `n` lines of input, `a` has its elements at indices 1 to `n` incremented by 1 for each 'F' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the input lines, `b` has its elements at indices 1 to `n` incremented by 1 for each 'S' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the input lines, `sa` is a list containing the value 3, and `sb` retains its value as described in the precondition.**
