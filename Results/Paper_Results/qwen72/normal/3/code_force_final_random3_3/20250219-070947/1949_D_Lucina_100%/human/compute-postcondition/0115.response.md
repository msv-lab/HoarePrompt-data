The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`, which means `n` must still be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24.

State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2. If `a[1]` and `b[1]` are both 0, `sa` is a list that now includes the value 1.**
