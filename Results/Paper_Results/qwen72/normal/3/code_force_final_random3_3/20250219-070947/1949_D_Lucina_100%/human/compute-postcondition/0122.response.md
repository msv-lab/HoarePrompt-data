The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start from 1. However, the initial state indicates that `i` is `n + 1`, which means the loop will not execute as `i` is already beyond the upper bound of the range.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `i` to start from 1, and `n` should remain within the specified range (2 <= n <= 24).

State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0. The values of `a`, `b`, `sb`, and `t` remain unchanged.**
