Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 2. If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb` (i.e., `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`), `nx` is the original value of `nx` followed by 'S'. Otherwise, if `xx[2][0]` is not '?' and `n` is less than 8, `nx` is 'SF'. If `xx[2][0]` is not '?' and `n` is 8 or greater, `nx` is 'FF'. If `xx[2][0]` is '?' and `n` is less than 8, `nx` is 'SF'. If `xx[2][0]` is '?' and `n` is 8 or greater, `nx` is 'FF'.***
