Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 3, `nx` is now `nx` + 'S'.**

The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the variable `nx`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `sb`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `nx`.
