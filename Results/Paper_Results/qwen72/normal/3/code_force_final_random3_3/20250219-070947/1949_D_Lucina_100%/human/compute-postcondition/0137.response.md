Output State: **`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, `j` is 2, `nx` is a string that is either 'FS' or 'SS'.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `nx` is determined based on the conditions involving `xx[i][j - 1]` and the list `sa`.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is a string containing the character at index 0 of the string at index 1 in `xx`. After the code `nx += 'S'` is executed, `nx` will be the original character followed by 'S'.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` is 'F'. After the code `nx += 'S'` is executed, `nx` will be 'FS'.
- Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. After the code `nx += 'S'` is executed, `nx` will be 'SS'.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `sa`, and `j` remain unchanged.
