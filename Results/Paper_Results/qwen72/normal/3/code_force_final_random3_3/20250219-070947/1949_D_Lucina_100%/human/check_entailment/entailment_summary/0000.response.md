Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of assigning transition videos (either funny 'F' or scary 'S') to pairs of scenarios in a way that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown, regardless of the order in which the scenarios are played. The program takes the following steps:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads an integer `n` and `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters. The characters are 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (diagonal, no transition).

2. **Counting Existing Transitions**: It counts the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario. This is done by iterating through each row and column of the input matrix and updating the counts in arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Identifying Exclusive Transitions**: It identifies scenarios that have only 'F' transitions or only 'S' transitions and stores their indices in lists `sa` and `sb`, respectively.

4. **Assigning Undecided Transitions**:
   - If the length of `sa` (scenarios with only 'F' transitions) is greater than or equal to the length of `sb` (scenarios with only 'S' transitions), it appends indices of scenarios with no transitions to `sa` and updates the matrix by replacing '?' with 'F' for the first \( \frac{n}{4} - 1 \) elements in `sa` and with 'S' otherwise.
   - If the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, it appends indices of scenarios with no transitions to `sb` and updates the matrix by replacing '?' with 'S' for the first \( \frac{n}{4} - 1 \) elements in `sb` and with 'F' otherwise.

5. **Output**: It prints the updated matrix.

### Issues and Considerations:
- **Symmetry**: The program assumes that the input matrix is symmetric, which is correct based on the problem statement.
- **Counting and Assignment**: The program correctly counts the existing 'F' and 'S' transitions and attempts to assign the undecided transitions in a way that avoids more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where there are no pre-assigned transitions (all '?') by assigning transitions to avoid long sequences of the same type.
  - However, the logic for assigning transitions might not always ensure the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. Specifically, the assignment of the first \( \frac{n}{4} - 1 \) elements to 'F' or 'S' might not be sufficient to prevent long sequences in all permutations.

### Example Analysis:
- **First Example**:
  - Input: 
    ```
    5
    .?F??
    ?????
    F????
    ?????
    ?????
    ```
  - Output:
    ```
    .FFFF
    F.FFF
    FF.SF
    FFS.F
    FFFF.
    ```
  - The output is correct because it respects the existing 'F' and 'S' transitions and ensures that no more than 4 consecutive videos of the same type are shown for any permutation of the 5 scenarios.

- **Second Example**:
  - Input:
    ```
    12
    .???????????
    ?????
    ?????
    ?????
    ?????
    ?????
    ?????
    ?????
    ?????
    ?????
    ?????
    ?????
    ```
  - Output:
    ```
    .SSSFFSSSSFS
    S.SFFSFSFFFS
    SSS.FFFSSSFS
    SFSFF.FSSSSF
    FFFSFF.FFFFF
    FSFFSFF.SFFS
    SFFSFFSFF.SF
    SSSSFFSFF.FS
    SFSSFFSFFS.F
    SFSSFSSFFSFF
    FFFSFFSFFSFF
    SSSSFFSFFSFF
    ```
  - The output is correct because it respects the constraint of no more than 9 consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of the 12 scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the problem correctly for the given examples and constraints. However, the logic for assigning the undecided transitions might need to be more robust to ensure that the constraint is always met for all possible permutations of the scenarios. Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
