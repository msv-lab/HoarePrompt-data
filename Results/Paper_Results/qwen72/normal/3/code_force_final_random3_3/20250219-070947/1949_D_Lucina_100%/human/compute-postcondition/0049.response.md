Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `j` is 2. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'S', the value of `b[1]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `b[1]` remains unchanged. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'F', the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1.***
