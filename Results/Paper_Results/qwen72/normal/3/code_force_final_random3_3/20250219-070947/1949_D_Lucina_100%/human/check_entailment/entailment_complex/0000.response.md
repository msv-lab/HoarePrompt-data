Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type are shown, regardless of the order in which the scenarios are played. The program does this by first reading the input matrix and counting the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario. It then categorizes scenarios into two lists, `sa` and `sb`, based on whether they have only 'F' or only 'S' transitions, respectively. If the number of scenarios with only 'F' transitions is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only 'S' transitions, it prioritizes adding 'F' transitions to the undecided ones. Otherwise, it prioritizes adding 'S' transitions.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Indexing and Off-by-One Error**: The program uses `n // 4 - 1` to determine the number of scenarios to assign 'F' or 'S' to. This is incorrect because it should be `n // 4` to ensure the correct number of scenarios are considered. For example, if `n = 12`, `n // 4 - 1` would be 2, but it should be 3.

2. **Symmetry Handling**: The program does not explicitly ensure that the matrix remains symmetric after replacing '?' with 'F' or 'S'. While the input is guaranteed to be symmetric, the program should ensure that the output matrix is also symmetric.

3. **Consecutive Transitions Check**: The program does not explicitly check if the generated matrix meets the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type. This is a critical part of the problem, and the program should include a mechanism to verify this.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to produce a correct solution for all valid inputs. The off-by-one error in the indexing and the lack of symmetry enforcement and consecutive transitions check can lead to invalid outputs.

Correctness: **False**
