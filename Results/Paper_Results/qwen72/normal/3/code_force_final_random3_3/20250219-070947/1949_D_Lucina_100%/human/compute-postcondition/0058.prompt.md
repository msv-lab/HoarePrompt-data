Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `x` is the new input provided by the user, `xx` is a list that now includes the previous value of `x`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, and `j` is 1. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'F', the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'S', the value of `b[1]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `b[1]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, and `j` is 2. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'F', the value at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1, and the state of `b[1]` remains unchanged. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'S', the value of `b[1]` is increased by 1, and the state of `a[1]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the states of both `a[1]` and `b[1]` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, and `j` is 3. If `x[2]` is 'F', `a[3]` is incremented by 1, and the states of `a[1]` and `b[1]` remain unchanged. If `x[2]` is 'S', `b[1]` and `b[3]` are both increased by 1, and the state of `a[1]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the states of `a[1]`, `a[3]`, and `b[1]` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
