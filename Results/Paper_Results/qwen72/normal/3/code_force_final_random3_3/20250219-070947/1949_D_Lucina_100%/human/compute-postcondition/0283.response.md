To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `j` and `n`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24
- `i` is 3
- `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0
- `j` is 2
- `nx` is determined based on the conditions provided

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented to 3.
- `n` remains the same (2 <= n <= 24).

### Final State:
State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 3, `nx` is determined based on the conditions provided**.
