Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 3, `nx` is the original value of `nx` followed by 'F'.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing value of `nx`.
- The initial value of `nx` is determined by the conditions provided in the initial state. However, since the exact value of `nx` is not specified, we only know that it is modified by appending 'F' to it.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `sb`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The output state reflects the updated value of `nx` and retains the initial conditions for the other variables.
