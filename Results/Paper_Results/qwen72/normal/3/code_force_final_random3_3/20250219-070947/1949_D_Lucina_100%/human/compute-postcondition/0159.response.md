Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, `j` is 1, and `nx` is a string. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not a question mark (`?`), `nx` is a string containing the character at index 0 of the element at index 2 of `xx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is a question mark (`?`), and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
