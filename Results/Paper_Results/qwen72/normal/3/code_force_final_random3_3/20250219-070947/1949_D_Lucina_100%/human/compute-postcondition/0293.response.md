The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, the function implicitly accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters. The characters can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (same scenario). The matrix formed by these strings is symmetric, and the number of 'F' and 'S' characters does not exceed 2 * floor(n / 2).

The function processes this input and returns a result based on the input matrix. However, the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Given the context, we can infer that the function likely returns some form of classification or analysis of the matrix, but without more details, we cannot specify the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each containing `n` characters ('F', 'S', '?', or '.'). It processes the symmetric matrix formed by these strings and returns a result based on the input, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
