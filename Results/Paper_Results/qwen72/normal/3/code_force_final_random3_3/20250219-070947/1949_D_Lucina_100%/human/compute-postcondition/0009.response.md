Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is the input provided by the user, `j` is 1, and `a[1]` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `a[1]` is incremented by 1, and the states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged. The character at the 0th index of `x` is still 'F'.
