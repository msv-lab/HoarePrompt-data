Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is `n`, `xx` contains `n` strings, each string being one of the `n` lines of input, `a` has its elements at indices 1 to `n` incremented by 1 for each 'F' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the input lines, `b` has its elements at indices 1 to `n` incremented by 1 for each 'S' encountered in the corresponding positions (0 to `n-1`) of the input lines. `sa` is a list containing the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0. `sb` is a list containing the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `b` is greater than 0 and the corresponding element in `a` is 0. Additionally, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` is a list that now contains the value 1. Otherwise, `sb` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` is now [1, 2]. Otherwise, `sb` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` is now [1, 2, 3]. Otherwise, `sb` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
