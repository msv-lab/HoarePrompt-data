Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding element in `a` is 0 and the corresponding element in `b` is 0, `j` is 2. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` is a string that has been updated to include an additional 'F' at the end. Otherwise, `nx` is a string that is either 'FS' or 'SS'.***
