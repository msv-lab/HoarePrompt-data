Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 3, `nx` is now `nx + xx[3][2]`.** 

The value of `nx` is updated by adding the value at `xx[3][2]` to it. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `sb`, `j`) remain unchanged.
