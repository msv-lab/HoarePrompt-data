Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is `n`, `nx` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `nx` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `sb`, or `j`, so they remain as they were in the initial state. The only change is that `nx` is now an empty string.
