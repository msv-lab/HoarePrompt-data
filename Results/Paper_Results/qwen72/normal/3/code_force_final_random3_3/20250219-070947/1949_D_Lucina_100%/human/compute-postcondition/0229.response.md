Postcondition: ***`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` followed by 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` followed by 'F' otherwise. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is 'SS' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or 'F' otherwise.***
