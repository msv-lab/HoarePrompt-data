n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input is a list of n strings, each of length n, where each string represents a row in the transition video plan. Each character in the string is either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (same scenario, no transition). The matrix is symmetric, and it contains at most 2 * floor(n/2) 'F' or 'S' characters.
