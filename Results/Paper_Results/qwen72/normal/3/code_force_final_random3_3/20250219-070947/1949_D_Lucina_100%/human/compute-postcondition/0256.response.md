Postcondition: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 2, `sb` contains the indices from 1 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` are both 0, `j` is 2. If `xx[2][0]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at index 0 of `xx[2]` concatenated with the character at index 1 of `xx[2]`. If `xx[2][0]` is '?', and `n` is less than 8, `nx` is 'S' concatenated with the character at index 1 of `xx[2]`. If `xx[2][0]` is '?', and `n` is 8 or greater, `nx` is 'F' concatenated with the character at index 1 of `xx[2]`. If `xx[2][0]` is '?', and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` followed by 'S'. If `xx[2][0]` is not '?' and `n` is less than 8, `nx` is 'SF'. If `xx[2][0]` is not '?' and `n` is 8 or greater, `nx` is 'FF'. If `xx[2][0]` is '?' and `n` is less than 8, `nx` is 'SF'. If `xx[2][0]` is '?' and `n` is 8 or greater, `nx` is 'FF'.**
