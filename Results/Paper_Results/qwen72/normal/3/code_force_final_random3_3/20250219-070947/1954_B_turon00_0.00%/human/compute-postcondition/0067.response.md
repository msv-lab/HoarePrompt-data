Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0. If `len(aa) == 1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.**

The initial state remains the same, but the variable `cnt` is now explicitly set to 0. The other variables and conditions are unchanged.
