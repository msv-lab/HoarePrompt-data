Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is `n`, `cnt` is 0. If `len(aa) == 1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is 0. If the first element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `0`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `0` if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 2 or 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
