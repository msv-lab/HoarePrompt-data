The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is 1. If the first element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `0`.**
