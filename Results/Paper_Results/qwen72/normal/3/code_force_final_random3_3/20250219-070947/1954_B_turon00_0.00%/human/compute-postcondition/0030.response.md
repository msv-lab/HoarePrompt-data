To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of `a`.
   - `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest `cnt` encountered during the loop that was not reset to 0.

2. **Understanding `cnt` and `ans`:**
   - `cnt` is calculated by counting the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
   - If the last element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest `cnt` encountered during the loop that was not reset to 0.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - `tmp` is the first element of `a`.
   - `i` is set to `n-1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - The loop will iterate from the end of the list `a` to the beginning, checking if each element is equal to `tmp`.
   - If an element is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented.
   - If an element is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is reset to 0.
   - The smallest non-zero `cnt` encountered during the loop is stored.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest non-zero `cnt`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If the last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` will be the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
   - If the last element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` will be 0.
   - `ans` will be the minimum value between `n` and the smallest non-zero `cnt` encountered during the loop.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value between n and the smallest non-zero cnt encountered during the loop that was not reset to 0)**
