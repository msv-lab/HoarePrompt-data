Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user.
- `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`.
- `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is very straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
- The value `-1` is a constant integer and will be printed as is.

### Output:
Output: **-1**

This output is independent of the initial state and will always print `-1` when the `print` statement is executed.
