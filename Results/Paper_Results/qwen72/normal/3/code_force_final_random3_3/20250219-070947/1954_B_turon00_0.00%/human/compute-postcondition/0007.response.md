Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of `a`.
   - `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`.
   - The set `aa` contains exactly one unique element.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `aa` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.
   - The condition that `aa` contains exactly one unique element implies that all elements in the list `a` are the same, but this information is not used in the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables and objects.

Output: **-1**
