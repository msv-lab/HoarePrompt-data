Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is `n`. If `len(aa) == 1`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest `cnt` encountered during the loop that was not reset to 0. If `len(aa) != 1`, the values of `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is 0, `ans` is `n` if `a[0] == tmp` and is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `a[0] != tmp`, `cnt` is 1 if `len(aa) == 1` or if `a[0] == tmp` and `len(aa) != 1`, and is 0 if `a[0] != tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, `i` is 1. If `a[i] == tmp`, `ans` is `n` if `a[0] == tmp` and is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `a[0] != tmp`, `cnt` is 2 if `len(aa) == 1` or if `a[0] == tmp` and `len(aa) != 1`, and is 1 if `a[0] != tmp`. If `a[i] != tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of the new `a`, and `i` is 2. If `a[i] == tmp`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the updated `cnt`. If `a[i] != tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and the previous `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
