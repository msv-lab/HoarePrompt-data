Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Check for All Elements Being the Same**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array `a` are the same by converting the array to a set `aa` and checking if the length of the set is 1.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Counting Elements**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to the minimum of the current `ans` and the count `cnt` of consecutive elements.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to ensure the last segment of consecutive elements is considered.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:

- The program assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the smallest segment of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element `tmp`. This assumption is incorrect because the array can be beautiful even if it contains segments of different lengths of the same element.
- The correct approach should be to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no segment of three elements exists where the middle element can be replaced by its neighbors. This requires a more complex logic to identify and handle such segments.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
