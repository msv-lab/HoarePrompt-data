Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements of `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest `cnt` encountered during the loop that was not reset to 0.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `cnt` remains as it was defined in the initial state: it is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise it is 0.
- The value of `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
