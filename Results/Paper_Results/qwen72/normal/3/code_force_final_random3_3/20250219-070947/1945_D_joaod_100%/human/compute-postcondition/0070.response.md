The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `v` is `na_frente` and `na_frente` is greater than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, the specific value of `v` and the specific value added to `total` are not explicitly known, but the relationship between the variables is maintained.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is the maximum representable floating-point number, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
