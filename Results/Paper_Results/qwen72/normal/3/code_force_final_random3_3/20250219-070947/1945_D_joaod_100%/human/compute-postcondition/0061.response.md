Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers read from input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers read from input, `total` is 0, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Additionally, the element at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the element at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. If `best` was greater than `total` plus the element at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to this new value. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.**
