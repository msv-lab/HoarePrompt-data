Output State: **`na_frente` must be at least 1, `v` is 0, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` remains the same.**

Explanation: The value of `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, where `v` is 0. The other variables, `na_frente` and `best`, remain unchanged. The condition for `best` being updated is not triggered by this code snippet, so `best` retains its previous value. The value of `v` is still 0, and `na_frente` must still be at least 1.
