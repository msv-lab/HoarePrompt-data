The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v` and `na_frente`. The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0 (inclusive), decrementing `v` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 0, and `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to have executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` must be decremented by 1, making `v` -1, and `na_frente` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5; `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than 0, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers read from input, `v` is -1, `total` and `best` are updated as per the loop body conditions.**
