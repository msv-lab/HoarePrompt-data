You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is `cases - 1`, `na_frente` is -1, `pos_final` is the last input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers read from input, `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value) to 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value) to 0 that are less than or equal to `pos_final`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from input. For each test case, it reads two integers `na_frente` and `pos_final`, followed by two lists of integers `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. It calculates the minimum cost to move from position `na_frente` to `pos_final` by either swapping elements or passing through them, and prints the best (minimum) cost found. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remaining unchanged, and the calculated best cost for each test case being printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `na_frente` and the desired position `pos_final`.
   - It then reads the costs `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each person in the queue.
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1, which is correct because the problem uses 1-based indexing.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total cost.
   - `best` is initialized to `sys.float_info.max`, which will be used to track the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people.

3. **Iterating Through the Queue:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning using a reverse loop (`for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1)`).
   - For each person `v` in the queue:
     - If `v` is within the range of the desired position `pos_final`:
       - It checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with person `v` is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
       - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
     - If `v` is not within the range of the desired position:
       - It simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all people in the queue, the program prints the minimum cost `best` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The logic for updating `best` and `total` is sound. It ensures that Kirill spends the minimum number of coins to reach a position within the first `m` people.
- The use of `sys.float_info.max` to initialize `best` ensures that the initial value is higher than any possible cost, allowing the program to find the minimum cost correctly.
- The program efficiently iterates through the queue in reverse, which is necessary to ensure that Kirill can make the optimal decision at each step.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately and follows the logic required to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `m` people.

### Correctness:
**True**
