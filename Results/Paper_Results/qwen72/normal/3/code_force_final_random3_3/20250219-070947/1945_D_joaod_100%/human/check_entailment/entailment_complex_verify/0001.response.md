### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `na_frente` and the desired position `pos_final`.
   - It then reads the costs `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each person in the queue.
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1, which is correct because the problem uses 1-based indexing.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will be used to accumulate the total cost.
   - `best` is initialized to `sys.float_info.max`, which will be used to track the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people.

3. **Iterating Through the Queue:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning using a reverse loop (`for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1)`).
   - For each person `v` in the queue:
     - If `v` is within the range of the desired position `pos_final`:
       - It checks if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with person `v` is less than the current best cost. If so, it updates `best`.
       - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
     - If `v` is not within the range of the desired position:
       - It simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all people in the queue, the program prints the minimum cost `best` for each test case.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
  - `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \le m \le n \le 200,000\).
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).
  - `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \le b_i \le 10^9\).
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

- **State After Function Call:**
  - `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
  - `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \le m \le n \le 200,000\).
  - `a` and `b` are lists of integers read from input.
  - `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
  - `c` is `cases - 1`.
  - `na_frente` is -1.
  - `pos_final` is the last input integer minus 1.
  - `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value) to 0.
  - `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` (initial value) to 0 that are less than or equal to `pos_final`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads and processes the input for multiple test cases.
  - It correctly adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` to 0-based indexing.

- **Correctness of Cost Calculation:**
  - The program iterates through the queue in reverse, which is necessary to ensure that Kirill can make the optimal decision at each step.
  - The logic for updating `best` and `total` is sound:
    - When `v` is within the range of `pos_final`, it updates `best` if the current total cost plus the cost to swap with person `v` is less than the current best cost.
    - It then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
    - When `v` is not within the range of `pos_final`, it simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `na_frente` is equal to `pos_final` or when `na_frente` is very small.
  - The use of `sys.float_info.max` ensures that the initial value of `best` is higher than any possible cost, allowing the program to find the minimum cost correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately and follows the logic required to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `m` people.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
