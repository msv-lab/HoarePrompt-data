You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))
    a_temp = a_new.copy()
    for i in range(1, len(a_new)):
        a_new[i] = a_new[i] - a_temp[i - 1]
    return a_new

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        if a[0] % 2 == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
    else:
        winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)
        if winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1):
            return 1
        else:
            return 2



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a list of positive integers `a` and a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= len(a)). It returns either 1 or 2 based on the following conditions: If `n` is 1, it always returns 1. If `n` is 2, it returns 1 if the first element of `a` is even, otherwise it returns 2. For `n` greater than 2, it recursively checks the rest of the list (`a[1:]`) with `n-1` and returns 1 if the recursive call returns 2 or if it returns 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1; otherwise, it returns 2.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game is a combinatorial game where players take turns removing the same number of stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of stones in the piles and how it affects the game.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function takes a list of pile sizes `a` and returns a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list of pile sizes.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the pile sizes into a form that can be more easily analyzed for the game's outcome.
   - The transformation is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and then computing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - This function determines the winner of the game given the transformed pile sizes `a` and the number of piles `n`.
   - The base cases are:
     - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can always remove all stones.
     - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the winner depends on the parity of the smallest pile. If the smallest pile has an even number of stones, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the outcome of the game by considering the first pile and the remaining piles.
   - The recursive call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` checks the outcome of the game if the first pile is removed.
   - The function returns `1` if Alice wins and `2` if Bob wins.

4. **Combining the Functions:**
   - The main logic of the program is to use `func_1` to transform the pile sizes and then use `func_2` to determine the winner.
   - The transformation in `func_1` is crucial because it simplifies the problem by reducing the pile sizes to their differences, which can be more easily analyzed for parity.

5. **Testing the Program:**
   - The provided test cases should be checked to ensure the program produces the correct output.
   - For example, in the first test case with piles `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the transformation results in `[3]`, and Alice wins because she can remove all stones in one move.
   - In the second test case with piles `[1, 7]`, the transformation results in `[1, 6]`, and Bob wins because Alice must remove 1 stone, leaving Bob with 6 stones to remove on his turn.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The transformation in `func_1` and the recursive analysis in `func_2` are consistent with the game's rules and the optimal play strategy.
