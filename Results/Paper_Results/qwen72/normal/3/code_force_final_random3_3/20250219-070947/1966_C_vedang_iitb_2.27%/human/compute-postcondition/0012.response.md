Postcondition: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), `n` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`, and `winNext` is not equal to 2, and either `winNext` is not equal to 1 or `a[0]` is equal to 1**
