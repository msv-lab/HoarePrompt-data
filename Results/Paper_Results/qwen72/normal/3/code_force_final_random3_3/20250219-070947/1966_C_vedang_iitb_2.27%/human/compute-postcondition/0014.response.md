The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of positive integers, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a). The function returns an integer, which can be either 1 or 2, based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of positive integers `a` and a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= len(a)), and returns either 1 or 2 based on the input parameters.**
