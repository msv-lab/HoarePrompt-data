Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function sorts the unique elements of the array and then computes the difference between consecutive elements.
   - The purpose of this function is not clear in the context of the game. The game involves removing the same number of stones from each nonempty pile, and the function does not directly help in determining the winner.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to determine the winner based on the number of piles and the first element of the sorted unique array.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the game's rules, especially when there are more than two piles.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the winner of the game, we need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles. The key observation is that if the number of piles is odd, Alice can always win by removing the smallest possible number of stones (1) on her first turn, ensuring that the number of piles remains odd for Bob. Conversely, if the number of piles is even, Bob can always win by mirroring Alice's moves.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def determine_winner(n, piles):
    # If the number of piles is odd, Alice wins
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return "Alice"
    else:
        return "Bob"

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(determine_winner(n, piles))
```

This implementation correctly determines the winner based on the number of piles, which is the key factor in this game.
