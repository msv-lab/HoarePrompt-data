### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing stones from piles.
   - On each turn, a player must choose a positive integer \( k \) that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and remove \( k \) stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The game is symmetric in the sense that if the piles are all the same size, the player who goes first (Alice) can always win by removing all stones in one turn.
   - If the piles have different sizes, the game becomes more complex, but the key is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles and the smallest pile size.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list of pile sizes and returns a sorted list of unique pile sizes, where each element (starting from index 1) is the difference between the current element and the previous element.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the list of pile sizes into a form that can be more easily analyzed for the game's outcome.
   - The transformation ensures that the smallest pile size is always 1, and the other pile sizes are relative differences from the smallest pile.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list of pile sizes.
   - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can remove all stones in one turn.
   - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the game depends on the parity of the smallest pile size:
     - If the smallest pile size is even, Alice can always win by removing an even number of stones.
     - If the smallest pile size is odd, Bob can always win because Alice will be forced to leave an odd number of stones, and Bob can then remove all stones.
   - For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the outcome by considering the next smallest pile size and the remaining piles.

5. **Recursive Strategy:**
   - The recursive strategy in `func_2` is based on the idea that the game can be reduced to a smaller subgame by removing the smallest pile size.
   - If the subgame results in a win for the next player (`winNext == 2`), the current player (Alice) wins.
   - If the subgame results in a win for the current player (`winNext == 1`) and the smallest pile size is not 1, the current player (Alice) wins.
   - Otherwise, the current player (Alice) loses.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where there is only one pile correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where there are two piles correctly by checking the parity of the smallest pile size.
   - The recursive approach ensures that the program can handle larger numbers of piles by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

### Correctness:
Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. The transformation in `func_1` and the recursive strategy in `func_2` are consistent with the problem's requirements and handle all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: **True****
