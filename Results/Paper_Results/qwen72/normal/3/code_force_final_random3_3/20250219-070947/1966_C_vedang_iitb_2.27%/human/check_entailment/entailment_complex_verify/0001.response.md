### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game is a combinatorial game where players take turns removing the same number of stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of stones in the piles and how it affects the game.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function takes a list of pile sizes `a` and returns a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list of pile sizes.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the pile sizes into a form that can be more easily analyzed for the game's outcome.
   - The transformation is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and then computing the differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Correctness Check:**
     - The function correctly sorts the unique elements of `a` and computes the differences.
     - The transformation is valid because it reduces the problem to a simpler form where the differences between pile sizes are considered.
     - For example, for the input `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the output is `[3]`, which is correct.
     - For the input `[1, 7]`, the output is `[1, 6]`, which is also correct.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - This function determines the winner of the game given the transformed pile sizes `a` and the number of piles `n`.
   - The base cases are:
     - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can always remove all stones.
     - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the winner depends on the parity of the smallest pile. If the smallest pile has an even number of stones, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the outcome of the game by considering the first pile and the remaining piles.
   - The recursive call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` checks the outcome of the game if the first pile is removed.
   - The function returns `1` if Alice wins and `2` if Bob wins.
   - **Correctness Check:**
     - The base cases are correctly handled.
     - The recursive logic is sound. It correctly considers the outcome of the game if the first pile is removed and checks if the remaining piles allow the current player to win.
     - For example, for the input `[3]` (one pile), the function returns `1` (Alice wins).
     - For the input `[1, 6]` (two piles), the function returns `2` (Bob wins) because the smallest pile is odd.
     - For the input `[1, 2, 3]` (three piles), the function correctly returns `1` (Alice wins) because the recursive call on `[2, 3]` returns `2` (Bob wins), and Alice can win by removing 1 stone from each pile.

4. **Combining the Functions:**
   - The main logic of the program is to use `func_1` to transform the pile sizes and then use `func_2` to determine the winner.
   - The transformation in `func_1` is crucial because it simplifies the problem by reducing the pile sizes to their differences, which can be more easily analyzed for parity.
   - **Correctness Check:**
     - The main loop reads the input, applies the transformation using `func_1`, and then determines the winner using `func_2`.
     - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and produces the expected output for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The transformation in `func_1` and the recursive analysis in `func_2` are consistent with the game's rules and the optimal play strategy.

Final: **True**
