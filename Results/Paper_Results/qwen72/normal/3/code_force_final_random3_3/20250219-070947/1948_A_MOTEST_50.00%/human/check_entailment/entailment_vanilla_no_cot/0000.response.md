Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly addresses the problem statement. Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each.

2. **Special Case Handling**: The program correctly identifies that a string with exactly one special character is impossible, as a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. Therefore, it prints 'NO' for `n == 1`.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating pairs of the same character from the uppercase alphabet. This ensures that each character in the string is special because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with the string 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters at positions 1, 2, and 3). It then continues to add pairs of the same character from the uppercase alphabet, ensuring that the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string for valid cases, and 'NO' for the invalid case where `n == 1`.

5. **Length Constraint**: The program ensures that the length of the constructed string does not exceed 200 characters, which is within the problem's constraints.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

- **Even `n`**:
  - The program constructs a string with `n` special characters by repeating each character from the alphabet twice. For example, if `n = 6`, the string 'AABBCC' is constructed, which has 6 special characters (A, A, B, B, C, C).

- **Odd `n`**:
  - The program starts with 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters) and then adds pairs of characters from the alphabet to reach the desired number of special characters. For example, if `n = 7`, the string 'AAABBBCCC' is constructed, which has 7 special characters (A, A, A, B, B, C, C).

The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
