Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 7 and odd, `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1] * 2` + `s[2] * 2` + `s[3] * 2`, `x` is 3, `j` is 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending `s[x] * 2` to it.
- `x` is 3, so `s[3] * 2` is appended to `ans`.
- The initial value of `ans` was 'AAA' + `s[1] * 2` + `s[2] * 2`.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1] * 2` + `s[2] * 2` + `s[3] * 2`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
