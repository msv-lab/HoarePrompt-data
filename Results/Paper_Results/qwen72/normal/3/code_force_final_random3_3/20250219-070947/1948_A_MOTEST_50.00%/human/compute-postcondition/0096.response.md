Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `x` is `n // 2`.
- If `n` is even:
  - `ans` is the string formed by concatenating each of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` repeated twice.
  - `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
- If `n` is odd:
  - `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2 + `s[2]` * 2 + ... + `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` * 2.
  - `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, `ans`, and `j`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
