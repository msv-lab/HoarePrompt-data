Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `ans` is the string `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2`, `x` is 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the string `s[2] * 2` to the existing value of `ans`. Initially, `ans` is `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2`, and `x` is 2. Therefore, after the code executes, `ans` becomes `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
