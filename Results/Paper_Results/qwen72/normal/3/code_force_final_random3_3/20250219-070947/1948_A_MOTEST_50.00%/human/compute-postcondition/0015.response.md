The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` was initially the string `s[0]` repeated twice, and `x` is 1. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an even input integer greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice, `x` is 1, `j` is 1**
