Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function and the main loop has some issues that can lead to incorrect results.

1. **Incorrect Handling of `w`**:
   - The line `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:` checks if `w` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, `w` is calculated as the square root of `q`, which is `(n + x - 2) // 2`. This approach is not correct for determining the valid values of `k`.
   - The square root check is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the value of `q` is 10, and `w` is approximately 3.16, which is not an integer. The program will not add 3 to the list `M`, even though `k = 3` is a valid solution.

2. **Incorrect Range in `func_1`**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):` should iterate over all possible divisors of `q`, not just up to the integer part of the square root. This can miss valid divisors. For example, if `n = 10` and `x = 2`, `q` is 10, and the loop will only check divisors up to 3, missing the divisor 5.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Adding Divisors**:
   - The divisors are added to the list `M` if they meet certain conditions, but the conditions are not correctly formulated. For example, the condition `if i >= x - 1:` and `if q // i >= x - 1:` are not sufficient to ensure that `k` is a valid solution.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the edge case where `n` is very close to `x`. For example, if `n = 100` and `x = 99`, the program should output 0, but it does not handle this case correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Iterate over possible values of `k` and check if the given `n` and `x` fit the described pattern.
- Ensure that the pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and that the number `x` is correctly assigned based on the position `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    valid_ks = []
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) < k - 1 and (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == x - 1:
            valid_ks.append(k)
    return len(valid_ks)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_ks(n, x))
```

This version correctly checks all possible values of `k` and ensures that the given `n` and `x` fit the described pattern.
