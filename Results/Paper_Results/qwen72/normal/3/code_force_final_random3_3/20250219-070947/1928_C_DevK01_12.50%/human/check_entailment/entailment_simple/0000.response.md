### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` and initializes `ans` to 0.

2. **Initial Check for Odd Sum:**
   - The program checks if the sum `n + x` is odd. If it is, the program prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because if `n + x` is odd, it is impossible to find a valid `k` that fits the given constraints. The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and for `k > 1`, `n + x` must be even.

3. **Function Call and List Initialization:**
   - The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` where `y = n + x`.
   - This function call is correct because it aligns with the problem's requirement to find divisors of `(n + x - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Additional Check for Larger `n`:**
   - The program checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`. If this condition is true, it calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` and adds the results to `L1`.
   - This additional check is necessary because it ensures that the second part of the settling pattern (where numbers decrease) is considered. The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` ensures that there are enough positions for the second part of the pattern to be relevant.

5. **Removing Duplicates and Output:**
   - The program converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and then prints the length of the set.
   - This step is correct because it ensures that each valid `k` is counted only once.

6. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` initializes an empty list `M` and calculates the square root `w` of `q`.
   - If `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1`, it adds `w` to `M`.
   - The function then iterates through all integers from 1 to `int(w) - 1` and checks if they are divisors of `q`. If they are, and if the divisor and its quotient are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, they are added to `M`.
   - Finally, the function returns the list `M`.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints. The initial checks, function calls, and the logic within `func_1` are all aligned with the problem description and handle the constraints appropriately.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
