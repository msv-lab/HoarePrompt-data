Postcondition: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < q ≤ 10^9, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` contains `[w]` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `M` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `w` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `q % i == 0`), and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
