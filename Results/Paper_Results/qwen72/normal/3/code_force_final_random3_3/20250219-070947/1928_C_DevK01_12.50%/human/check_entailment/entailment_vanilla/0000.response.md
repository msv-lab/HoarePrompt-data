### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` from the input.

2. **Initial Check for Odd `y`:**
   - The program calculates `y` as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, it means `n + x` is odd, and there is no valid `k` that can satisfy the conditions of the problem.

3. **Function `func_1` for Finding Divisors:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It first checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the square root to the list `M`.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `q` to find divisors of `q`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` and `q // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and adds them to the list `M`.

4. **Main Logic for Finding Valid `k` Values:**
   - The program calculates `L1` by calling `func_1` with `((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`. If this condition is true, it calls `func_1` again with `((n - x) // 2, x)` and adds the results to `L1`.
   - The program converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `y` is odd.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `3 * x - 2`, which means no additional valid `k` values can be found.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Odd `y` Check:**
  - If `y` is odd, the program correctly prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is because the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and `n + x` being odd means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy the pattern.

- **Finding Divisors:**
  - The function `func_1` is designed to find all valid `k` values by checking divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is a correct approach because the settling pattern involves numbers that are within the range of `1` to `k`.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The program combines the results from two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set. This ensures that all unique valid `k` values are counted.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of valid `k` values based on the given problem description and constraints. There are no obvious logical errors or issues with the approach.
