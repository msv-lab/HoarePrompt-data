### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem describes a specific pattern for numbering students in a line, which repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - Vasya remembers his position \(n\) and the number \(x\) he received, and we need to determine how many possible values of \(k\) fit this pattern.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it calculates \(y = n + x\) and checks if \(y\) is even.
   - If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 because the pattern described cannot produce an odd sum \(y\).
   - If \(y\) is even, it calls `func_1` with \((y - 2) // 2\) and \(x\) to find possible values of \(k\).
   - It also checks if \(n \geq 3x - 2\) and if so, calls `func_1` again with \((n - x) // 2\) and \(x\).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the unique list.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\), and their corresponding quotients.
   - It first checks if the square root of \(q\) is an integer and greater than or equal to \(x - 1\), and adds it to the list if true.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{q} \rfloor\) and adds divisors and their quotients to the list if they meet the criteria.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Even Check**: The program correctly identifies that \(y\) must be even for the pattern to work. This is because the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences, and the sum of \(n\) and \(x\) must be even for the pattern to fit.
   - **Divisor Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\) and their corresponding quotients. This is necessary because \(k\) must be a divisor of \(q\) or its quotient to fit the pattern.
   - **Combining Results**: The program correctly combines the results from the two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates to ensure each \(k\) is counted only once.
   - **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as \(n = 3x - 2\) and \(y\) being odd correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
