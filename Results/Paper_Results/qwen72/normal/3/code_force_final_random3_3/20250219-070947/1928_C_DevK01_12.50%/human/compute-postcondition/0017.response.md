Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < q â‰¤ 10^9, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is 2, `w` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `M` contains `[w, i, q // i, 2, q // i]` if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and `q` is divisible by `i` but `q // i` is less than `x - 1`, then `M` contains `[2, q // i]`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and `q` is not divisible by `i`, then `M` contains `[2]`. If `i` is less than `x - 1`, `M` remains unchanged.**
