You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of cows, `k` is an integer representing the index of your cow, and `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and all `a_i` are distinct.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `n - 1`, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` up to the point where the first element greater than `a[k - 1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element is found.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` up to the point where the first element greater than `a[k - 1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element is found, and wins is greater than or equal to `k`)
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`i` is `n - 1`, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` up to the point where the first element greater than `a[k - 1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element is found, and `wins` is less than `k`
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `k - 2`, `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + (k - 1 - win_with_swap)`, `wins` is less than `k`, and `k` remains the same.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: k - 2 (if wins is 0) or k - 1 - wins (if wins is not 0)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `max_wins` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of cows), `k` (an integer representing the index of your cow), and `ratings` (a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows). The function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
