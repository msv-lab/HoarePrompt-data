Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the input for multiple test cases. The `for _ in range(t):` loop should be indented to include the call to `func_1()`.

2. **Win Calculation Without Swap**: The logic for calculating the number of wins without swapping is incorrect. The loop should only consider the matches that your cow would participate in, which are from position `k` to the end of the list. The current loop iterates over the entire list, which is not correct.

3. **Win Calculation With Swap**: The logic for calculating the number of wins with a swap is also flawed. The program attempts to calculate the number of wins after a swap but does not correctly simulate the swap or the subsequent matches. It should consider the optimal position to swap your cow to maximize the number of wins.

4. **Output Logic**: The output logic is incorrect. The program should print the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve, either with or without a swap. The current logic does not correctly compute this.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_wins(n, k, a):
    # Calculate wins without swapping
    wins = 0
    if k > 1 and a[k-1] > a[k-2]:
        wins += 1
    for i in range(k, n-1):
        if a[i] > a[i+1]:
            wins += 1
        else:
            break

    # Calculate wins with optimal swap
    win_with_swap = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i == k - 1:
            continue
        # Simulate the swap
        a[k-1], a[i] = a[i], a[k-1]
        # Calculate wins after the swap
        temp_wins = 0
        if k > 1 and a[k-1] > a[k-2]:
            temp_wins += 1
        for j in range(k, n-1):
            if a[j] > a[j+1]:
                temp_wins += 1
            else:
                break
        # Revert the swap
        a[k-1], a[i] = a[i], a[k-1]
        # Update the maximum wins with swap
        win_with_swap = max(win_with_swap, temp_wins)

    return max(wins, win_with_swap)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max_wins(n, k, a))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Wins Without Swap**:
   - Check if the cow at position `k` can win the first match against the cow at position `k-1`.
   - Iterate from position `k` to `n-1` to count how many consecutive matches the cow at position `k` can win.

2. **Wins With Swap**:
   - Iterate over all possible positions to swap the cow at position `k` to.
   - For each swap, simulate the matches starting from the new position of the cow.
   - Revert the swap after calculating the wins to ensure the original list is not modified.
   - Track the maximum number of wins achieved with any swap.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the maximum number of wins, either with or without a swap.

This corrected program should handle the problem as described and produce the correct output for the given test cases.
