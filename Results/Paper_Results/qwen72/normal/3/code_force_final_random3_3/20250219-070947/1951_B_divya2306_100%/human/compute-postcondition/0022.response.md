To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`: This is the loop variable.
   - `win_with_swap`: This is the start of the range.
   - `k - 1`: This is the end of the range (exclusive).

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `win_with_swap` is less than `k - 1`.
   - If `win_with_swap` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, the loop will not execute.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` up to the point where the first element greater than `a[k - 1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element is found.
   - `wins` is less than `k`.
   - `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The loop variable `i` is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1` for the loop to execute.
   - Given that `wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` (which is `wins + 1`) must be less than `k - 1`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`. Since `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1` and `wins` is less than `k`, we need to ensure that `wins + 1` is less than `k - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`.
- `i` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains as `n - 1`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`, `wins` is less than `k`**
