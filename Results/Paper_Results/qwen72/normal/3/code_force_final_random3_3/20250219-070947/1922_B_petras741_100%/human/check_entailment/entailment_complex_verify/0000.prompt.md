You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    #State: `i` is `t`, `buffer` is an empty list. For each test case, if `n` is less than 3, the variables `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` remain undefined. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the sum of the counts of all elements in `eta` that appear in `w`, and `res` is the sum of the combinations of 3 elements from each `q[eta[j]]` plus the sum of the combinations of 2 elements from each `q[eta[j]]` multiplied by the total count of elements in `eta` that appear in `w` before the current element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `w`. If `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0. If `n` is 3 or greater, the function calculates and prints the number of unique combinations of three elements from the list `w` that are all the same, plus the number of unique combinations of two elements from the list `w` that are the same, multiplied by the count of the first unique element. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple distinct lengths of sticks, and it incorrectly calculates the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of valid triangles is flawed. The program assumes that if there are multiple sticks of the same length, they can form triangles with each other, but it does not correctly account for the possibility of forming triangles with sticks of different lengths.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
The correct output should be `2`, as mentioned in the problem description. However, the program will output `3`, which is incorrect. The program incorrectly includes the combination (3, 3, 2) as a valid triangle, but it is not a valid non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides (2 and 3) is not greater than the length of the longest side (3).

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Identify all unique stick lengths.
2. Count the number of sticks for each unique length.
3. Use the triangle inequality theorem to determine valid combinations of three sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle.
