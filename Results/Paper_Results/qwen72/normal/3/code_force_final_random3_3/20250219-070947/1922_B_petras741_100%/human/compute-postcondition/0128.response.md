Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is equal to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
