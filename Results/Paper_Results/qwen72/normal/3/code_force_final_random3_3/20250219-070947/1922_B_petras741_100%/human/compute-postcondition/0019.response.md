The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than `n + 1`, which is still satisfied since `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]` each incremented by 1, `j` is 1, and `eta` is either an empty list or a list containing the element 0 if `q[0]` is greater than 0**
