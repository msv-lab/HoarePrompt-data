The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, and `t` is the number of test cases, an input integer. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list**
