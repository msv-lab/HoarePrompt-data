Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]` each incremented by 1, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`, `res` is the result of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- `res` is calculated as `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.
- `q[eta[0]]` is the value of `rho`, which is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`.
- The formula `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6` computes the combination of `rho` taken 3 at a time, which is a common formula for calculating combinations.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
