The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `w[0]` incremented by 1, `j` is 1**
