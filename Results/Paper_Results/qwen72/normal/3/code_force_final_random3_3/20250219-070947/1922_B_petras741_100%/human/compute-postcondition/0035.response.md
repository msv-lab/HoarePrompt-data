Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]` each incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]` plus the value of `q` at the index `eta[1]`, `res` is the result of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * (q[eta[0]] + q[eta[1]])`.**
