Output State: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `t` is the number of test cases, an input integer. `buffer` is an empty list.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `buffer` is now an empty list.
