The code `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. The values of `j`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `r` are not directly modified by this code snippet, but the precondition states that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` and `r` is equal to `i + 1`. The value of `sum` will be updated based on the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`j`, `t`, `_`, `n` retain their initial values, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `r` is equal to `i + 1`, `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`.**
