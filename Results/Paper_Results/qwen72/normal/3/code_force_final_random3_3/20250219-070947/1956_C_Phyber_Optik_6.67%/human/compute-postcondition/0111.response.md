Let's analyze the print statement step by step based on the given initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement will print the integer `1` followed by the value of `j`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline, meaning the next print statement will continue on the same line.

4. **Values**:
   - `1` is a constant integer and will always be printed as `1`.
   - `j` is a variable that is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `j` can be any integer from 0 up to and including `n`.

5. **Output**:
   - The output will be `1` followed by the value of `j`, with a space at the end.

Output: **1 [j] (where j is an integer less than or equal to n)**
