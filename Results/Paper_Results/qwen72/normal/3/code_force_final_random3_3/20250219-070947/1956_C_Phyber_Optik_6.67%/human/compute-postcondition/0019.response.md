The code snippet `sum += i * n` increments the value of `sum` by the product of `i` and `n`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, `sum` is increased by \( 3 \times n \).

The initial conditions also include that if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `sum` is the initial value of `sum` plus \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is increased by \( i \times n \). However, the provided code snippet only updates `sum` by \( i \times n \), so the condition for `r` is not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `sum` is increased by \( 3 \times n \), `r` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial condition.**
