The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` will start from 1 and go up to `n`. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `n`, which means the loop would not execute as `i` is already at the end of the range. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to start from 1, and `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 0), `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, and `j` is `n + 1`**
