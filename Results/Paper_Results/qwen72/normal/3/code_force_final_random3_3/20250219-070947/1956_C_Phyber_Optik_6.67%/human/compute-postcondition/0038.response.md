Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `n + r` must be at least 2.
- `j` is `n + 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `j`**:
   - According to the initial state, `j` is defined as `n + 2`.
   - Since `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `j` will always be `n + 2`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j`, and will end with a space (`end=' '`).

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print `1` followed by the value of `j`, which is `n + 2`, and will end with a space.

Output: **1, n + 2, (where n is the input integer and must be greater than 0)**
