The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `r`) are not affected by this code.

Let's break down the initial state and the impact of the code:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `r` is 2.
- If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `sum` is \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) and `r` is 2. Otherwise, if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \leq i \times n \), then `sum` is \( i \times n \) and `r` is 2.

Now, let's calculate the new value of `sum`:
- The expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- The value of `sum` is updated by adding this result to its current value.

Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `sum`, we assume it is an unknown value. After the code execution, `sum` will be the initial value of `sum` plus \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \).

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `r` is 2, `sum` is the initial value of `sum` plus \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \).**
