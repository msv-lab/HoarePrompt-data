Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
   - The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the sequence, so each integer in the range is printed separated by a space.

4. **Output**:
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, the range will always generate at least one integer (1).
   - The exact sequence of integers printed will depend on the value of `n`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the sequence includes all integers from 1 to n inclusive)**
