The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n + r + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `r` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than or equal to `n + r + 1`. Given that `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust `j` to reflect this increment.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` and `r` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is a non-negative integer, and `j` is `j + 1`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1`. If `j` is greater than `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` still holds.**
