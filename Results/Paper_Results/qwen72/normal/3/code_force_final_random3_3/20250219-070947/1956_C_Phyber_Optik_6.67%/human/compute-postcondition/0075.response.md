Based on the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's break down the values of the variables and objects that are printed:

- `1` is a constant integer.
- `j` is incremented to 2, so its value is 2.
- The `end` parameter in the `print` function is set to `' '`, which means that after printing the values, a space will be added instead of a newline.

Given these details, the `print` statement will output:

Output: **1 2**
