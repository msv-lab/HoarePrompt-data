Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, and the condition \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \leq i \times n \) holds true**

The value of `sum` is updated to `i * n`, which is `1 * n` since `i` is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
