To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This is a new input integer greater than 0. The exact value of `n` is not provided, but it is a positive integer.
2. **`range(1, n + 1)`**: This generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.

### Explanation:
The `print` statement will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces. Since `n` is a positive integer, the output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of the input integer n)**
