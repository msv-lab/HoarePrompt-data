The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is a new input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

However, the condition `n + 1` must be greater than the new value of `i` (which is 3) for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` and `r` is 1. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, then `sum` is `i * n + 2 * n` and `r` is 0.**
