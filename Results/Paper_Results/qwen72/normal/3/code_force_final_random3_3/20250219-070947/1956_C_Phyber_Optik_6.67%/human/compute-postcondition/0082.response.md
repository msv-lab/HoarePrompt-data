Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `j` is 3.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 0. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it is a positive integer.

2. **Range Function**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - For example, if `n` is 5, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the sequence of integers generated by `range(1, n + 1)` separated by spaces.
   - For example, if `n` is 5, the output will be `1 2 3 4 5`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of the input integer n)**
