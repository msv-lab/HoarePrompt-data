Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 1, and the sum of the first `n` positive integers is greater than `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 1.
- The value of `j` was initially `n + r + 1`. Since `r` is now 1, `j` becomes `n + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
