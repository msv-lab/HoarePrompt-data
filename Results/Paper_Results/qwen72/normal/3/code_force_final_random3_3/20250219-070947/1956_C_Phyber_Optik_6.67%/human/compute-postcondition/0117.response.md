The objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `n`, and `r`. The loop condition is `j` being less than or equal to `n + r + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is a non-negative integer, and `j` is less than or equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and the condition `j <= n + r + 1` must still hold true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `r` is a non-negative integer
- `j` is less than or equal to `n`

For the next iteration:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now `j + 1`
- The condition `j <= n + r + 1` must still hold true, meaning `j + 1 <= n + r + 1`

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `j + 1`, and `j + 1 <= n + r + 1`**
