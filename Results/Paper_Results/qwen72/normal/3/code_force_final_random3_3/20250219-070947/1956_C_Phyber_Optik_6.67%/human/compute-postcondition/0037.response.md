The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `n`, and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n + r + 1`. If `j` is less than `n + r + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, and `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n + r` must be at least `j`.

Given that `j` is `n + 1` at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `j` will be `n + 2`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n + r + 1` must be greater than `n + 2`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, `n + r` must be at least 2, and `j` is `n + 2`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the program maintains the same state. Otherwise, the program also maintains the same state.**
