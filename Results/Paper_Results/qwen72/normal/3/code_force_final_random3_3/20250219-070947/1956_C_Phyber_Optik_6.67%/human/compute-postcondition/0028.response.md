Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `n + r` must be at least 1.
   - `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `j % n`, which is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Values of Variables:**
   - `2` is a constant integer.
   - `j` is greater than `n`, so `j % n` will be a value between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive). Since `j` is greater than `n`, `j % n` will be a non-negative integer less than `n`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The exact value of `j % n` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `j`, but it will be a non-negative integer less than `n`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **2, [j % n] (where [j % n] is a non-negative integer less than n)**
