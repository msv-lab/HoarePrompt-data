Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` is 3.
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `_` is 1 (though `_` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement prints the values of `1` and `j` separated by a space.
- The `end=' '` argument ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

### Values:
- `1` is a constant integer.
- `j` is explicitly given as 3.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the values of `1` and `j` separated by a space, followed by a space at the end.

Output: **1 3 **
