Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `r` must be a non-negative integer.
- `j` is greater than `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` into individual arguments for the `print` function.
- Since `n` is greater than 0, the range will always contain at least one element, which is 1.

### Example:
- If `n` is 5, then `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The `print` statement will unpack this sequence and print the numbers separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the sequence includes all integers from 1 to n inclusive)**
