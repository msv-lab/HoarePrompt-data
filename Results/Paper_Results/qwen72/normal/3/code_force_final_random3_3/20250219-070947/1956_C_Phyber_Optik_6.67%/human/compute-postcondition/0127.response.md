Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `r` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is defined as `j + 1`.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` holds.
- If `j` is greater than `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` still holds.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object, so the `print` statement will print the sequence of integers separated by spaces.

### Output:
- Since `n` is greater than 0, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.
- The `print` statement will print these integers separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the sequence includes all integers from 1 to n)**
