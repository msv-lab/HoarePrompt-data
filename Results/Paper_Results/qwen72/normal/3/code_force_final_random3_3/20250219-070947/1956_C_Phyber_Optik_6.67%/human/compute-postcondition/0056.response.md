Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `r` is 2, `sum` is now `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`.**

The value of `sum` has been updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `sum` is the result of the previous value of `sum` plus the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
