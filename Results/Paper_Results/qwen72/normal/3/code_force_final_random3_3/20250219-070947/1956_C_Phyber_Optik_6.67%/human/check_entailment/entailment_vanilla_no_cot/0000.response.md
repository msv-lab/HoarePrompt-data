Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix with no more than 2n operations, and the program's logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations is flawed.

### Issues:
1. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum in a way that does not correspond to the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The maximum sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), which is the sum of all elements in a permutation of length \( n \) multiplied by \( n \) (since each permutation is applied to a row or column).

2. **Number of Operations**: The program outputs \( n + r \) operations, where \( r \) is calculated in a way that does not ensure the operations are within the limit of \( 2n \). The correct number of operations should be \( 2n \) or fewer.

3. **Operation Type and Index**: The program outputs operations with indices that do not make sense. For example, it outputs column indices using \( j \% n \), which can result in zero, an invalid index.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum, you can simply apply the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) to each row and each column. This will ensure that each element in the matrix is a number from 1 to \( n \), and the sum of all elements will be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum and ensures that the number of operations is exactly \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit. Each operation is correctly formatted and valid.
