Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `sum` is increased by `i * n`. If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), then `sum` is \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 + i \times n \) and `r` is 1. Otherwise, if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \leq i \times n \), then `sum` is \( i \times n + i \times n \) and `r` is 0.**
