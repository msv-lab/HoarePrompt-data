The given code snippet introduces a type variable `T` using the `TypeVar` function from the `typing` module. However, this does not affect the values of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. The initial state remains unchanged, as the introduction of a type variable does not modify the existing variables or their values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 200,000, `v` is a list of integers of length n where 1 <= v_i <= 10^9, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. A type variable `T` has been introduced.**
