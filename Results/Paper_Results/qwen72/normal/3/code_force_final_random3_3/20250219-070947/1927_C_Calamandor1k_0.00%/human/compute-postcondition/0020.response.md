Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a` and must be greater than 0 or `len_b` is the length of `b` and must be greater than 0, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than 1. If `len_b` is greater than 1 and `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is 1. If `len_a` is greater than 1 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 2. Otherwise, `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` remains 0.**
