#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m). The lists a and b contain n and m integers, respectively, where each integer a_i and b_j satisfies 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
        
        count_a, count_b = 0, 0
        
        d = k // 2
        
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1
        
        print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is `k // 2`, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`. `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`. `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from user input, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m`, respectively. The function then checks if at least `k // 2` elements in both `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k` within the first `max(n, m)` elements. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and the lists `a` and `b` and integers `n`, `m`, and `k` being the inputs for each test case. The function does not return any value.
