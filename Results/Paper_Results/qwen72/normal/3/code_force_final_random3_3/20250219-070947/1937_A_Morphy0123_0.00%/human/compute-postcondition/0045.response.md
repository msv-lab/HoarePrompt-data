The variables in the loop head are `power` and `log2(n)`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must still be less than `log2(n)` after the adjustment. Since `power` is 2, `log2(n)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue. 

However, the state `n_cases` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2 does not affect the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 2, and `log2(n)` must be greater than 2**
