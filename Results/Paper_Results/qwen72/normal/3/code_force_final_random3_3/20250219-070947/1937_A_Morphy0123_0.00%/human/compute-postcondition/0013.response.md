Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than \(2^{\text{power}-1}\), `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n_cases`**: This variable remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
- **`i`**: This variable remains unchanged and is still 0.
- **`n`**: This variable remains unchanged and must be an input integer greater than 1.
- **`power`**: After the loop finishes executing, `power` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}}\) is greater than or equal to `n`. This means that `power` will be the smallest integer that satisfies the condition `power < log2(n)` in the loop, which is equivalent to `power` being the ceiling of `log2(n)`. 

For example, if `n` is 10, the loop will run until `power` is 4, because \(2^4 = 16\) is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 10.
