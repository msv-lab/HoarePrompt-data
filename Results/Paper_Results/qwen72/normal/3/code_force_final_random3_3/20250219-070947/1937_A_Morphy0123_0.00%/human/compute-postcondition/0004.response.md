The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`.

Based on the initial state:
- `n_cases` must be greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `i` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer, and the current value of `n` is 1 (though `n` is not used in the code snippet).

The `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables; it simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
