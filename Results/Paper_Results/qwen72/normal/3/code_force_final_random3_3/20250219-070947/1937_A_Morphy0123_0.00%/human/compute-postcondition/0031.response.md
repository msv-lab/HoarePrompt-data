Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\), `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n_cases` remains greater than 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` remains 1 because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\) for the loop to have executed the required number of times.
- The variable `power` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\). This means that the loop will stop when `power` is the smallest integer that makes \(2^{power}\) at least as large as `n`.

In simpler terms, `power` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^{power}\) is not less than `n`. For example, if `n` is 16, `power` will be 5 because \(2^5 = 32\) is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 16.
