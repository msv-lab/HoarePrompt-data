To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 ** power)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` is greater than 0 (this variable is not directly relevant to the calculation of `power`).
   - `i` is 2 (this variable is also not directly relevant to the calculation of `power`).
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `power` is the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)` minus 1.
   - `power` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Calculation of `power`:**
   - `log2(n)` is the base-2 logarithm of `n`.
   - The smallest integer greater than `log2(n)` can be found using the ceiling function, `ceil(log2(n))`.
   - `power` is then calculated as `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`.

3. **Ensuring `power` is not equal to `n`:**
   - Since `n` must be greater than 2, `log2(n)` will be greater than 1.
   - `ceil(log2(n))` will be at least 2 (since `log2(2) = 1` and `log2(3) = 1.58496...`, and the ceiling of both is 2).
   - Therefore, `power` will be at least 1 (since `ceil(log2(n)) - 1` will be at least 1).

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - `2 ** power` will be \(2\) raised to the power of `power`.

Given the initial state and the calculations:
- `power` is the smallest integer greater than `log2(n) - 1`.
- `2 ** power` will be \(2\) raised to this power.

Since `n` is greater than 2, `log2(n)` will be greater than 1, and `ceil(log2(n))` will be at least 2. Therefore, `power` will be at least 1.

Let's summarize the output:
- The value of `2 ** power` will be \(2\) raised to the power of the smallest integer greater than `log2(n) - 1`.

Output: **2 ** (smallest integer greater than log2(n) - 1) (where n is greater than 2 and power is the smallest integer greater than log2(n) - 1)**
