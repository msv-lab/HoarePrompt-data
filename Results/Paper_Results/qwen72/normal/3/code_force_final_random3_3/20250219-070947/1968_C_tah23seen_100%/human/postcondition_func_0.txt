The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` is calculated as `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is 1000000000. The input list `arr` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
