Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except for the elements from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` which are now calculated as `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1, and `i` is -1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The integer `n` remains unchanged.
- The list `ans` is now updated such that each element from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` is calculated by subtracting the corresponding element in `arr` from the next element in `ans`.
- The variable `i` is now -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
