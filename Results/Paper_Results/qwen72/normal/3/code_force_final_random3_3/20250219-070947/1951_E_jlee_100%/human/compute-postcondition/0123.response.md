Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count2` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 2 and `done` remains False. Otherwise, `count` remains greater than 0 and `done` remains False.***
