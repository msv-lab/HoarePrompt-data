Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise, and `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` > 1, `count2` remains equal to `count` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0, and the current iteration is skipped. If `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
