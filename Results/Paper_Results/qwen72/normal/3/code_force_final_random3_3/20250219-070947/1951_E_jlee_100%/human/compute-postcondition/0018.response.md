Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `done` is False.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - All characters in `s` are equal to `x`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
   - If `n` is 1, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

Given the initial state:
- Since all characters in `s` are equal to `x`, the first character and the last character of `s` are the same.
- Therefore, the condition `x` is not equal to the last character of `s` will always be False.
- The condition `n` is 1 will only be True if the string `string` has a length of 1.

Since the conditions for continuing to the next iteration of the loop are not met (because `x` is equal to the last character of `s` and `n` is not necessarily 1), the program will execute the `print('NO')` statement.

Output: **NO**
