Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `count` is greater than 0. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, `done` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
