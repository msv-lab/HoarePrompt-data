Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- The first character of `string` is not equal to the last character of `string`.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state, it will always print the same output regardless of the values of `n`, `j`, or the characters in `string`.

Output: **YES**
