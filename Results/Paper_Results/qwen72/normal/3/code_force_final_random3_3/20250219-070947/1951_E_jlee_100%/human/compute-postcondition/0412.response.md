To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is set to 2.
   - `count` and `count2` remain unchanged.
   - The conditions involve checking if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and updating the `done` variable accordingly.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is incremented by 1 and `done` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if `count` is 1 or greater, `done` remains unchanged.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given the initial state and conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `j`, `count`, or `done`. The conditions described do not affect the print statement directly, as the print statement is simply printing a constant string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **YES**
