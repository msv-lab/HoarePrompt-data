Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is set to 1, and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `n` is greater than 0, which means `s` is a non-empty list.
   - `j` is 1, so we are looking at the second element of the list `s`.
   - `count` is greater than 0, which means the condition `count >= 1` is always true.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition states that if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration.
   - Since `count` is greater than 0, the condition `count >= 1` is always true, and the loop will continue to the next iteration regardless of the value of `s[j]` or `x`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(2)` statement is outside the loop and does not depend on any of the conditions or variables inside the loop.
   - Therefore, the `print(2)` statement will always execute and print the integer 2.

### Conclusion:
The `print(2)` statement will print the integer 2, regardless of the values of `s`, `x`, `n`, `j`, `count`, or `done`.

Output: **2**
