Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is set to 1, and `done` is set to `True` if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.
   - If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Since `count` is already greater than 0, the condition `count` is greater than or equal to 1 is always true.
   - Therefore, the program will always continue to the next iteration of the loop if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - The `print('YES')` statement is not dependent on any of the conditions provided in the initial state. It will simply print 'YES' when executed.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `n`, `j`, `count`, `s`, and `x`.

Output: **YES**
