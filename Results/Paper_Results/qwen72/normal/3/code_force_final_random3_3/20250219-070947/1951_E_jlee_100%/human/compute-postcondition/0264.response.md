Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `count` is greater than or equal to 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count2` is increased by 1 if `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, or if `count` is greater than or equal to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains unchanged and `count2` is not modified.***
