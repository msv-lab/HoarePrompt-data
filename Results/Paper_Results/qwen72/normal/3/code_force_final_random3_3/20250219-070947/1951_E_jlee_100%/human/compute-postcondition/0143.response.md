Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string` that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count2` is 2. If `count2` == `count`, then `count` is greater than 0 and `done` remains False. If `count2` > `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` == `count` and `count` ≤ 1, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.***
