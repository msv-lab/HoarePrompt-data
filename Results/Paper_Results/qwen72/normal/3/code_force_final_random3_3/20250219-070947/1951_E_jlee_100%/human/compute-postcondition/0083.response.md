Output: **[string] (where [string] is the input string provided before the code is executed)**

Explanation:
- The `string` is described as an input string in the initial state.
- The `print(string)` statement will simply print the value of `string` as it is.
- Since the exact value of `string` is not provided in the initial state, the output will be the input string that was given before the code is executed.
