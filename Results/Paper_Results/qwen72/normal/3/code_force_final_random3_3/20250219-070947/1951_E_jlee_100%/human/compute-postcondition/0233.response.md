Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is set to 1, and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
