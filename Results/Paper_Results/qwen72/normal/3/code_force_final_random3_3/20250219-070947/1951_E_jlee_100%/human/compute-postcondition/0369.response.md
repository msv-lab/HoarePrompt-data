The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about variables `n`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, and `done`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
