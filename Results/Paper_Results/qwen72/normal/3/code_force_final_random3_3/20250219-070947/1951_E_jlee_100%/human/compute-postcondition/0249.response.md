To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, so `count` is set to 1, and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is greater than or equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `j`**: The value of `j` is explicitly given as 1.
2. **Value of `string`**: The variable `string` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer that it is the same as `s` (since the `print` statement uses `string` and the conditions use `s`).
3. **Value of `s[0]` and `s[n-1]`**: The initial state does not provide explicit values for `s[0]` and `s[n-1]`, but we know that `s` is a string or list of characters.
4. **Value of `s[j]` and `s[n-1-j]`**: The initial state indicates that `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, so `count` is set to 1. Additionally, `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

- **`string[:j]`**: This will print the substring of `string` from the start up to (but not including) the index `j`. Since `j` is 1, this will print the first character of `string`.
- **`string[j:]`**: This will print the substring of `string` starting from index `j` to the end. Since `j` is 1, this will print the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Conclusion:
Given that `j` is 1, the `print` statement will split the string `string` into two parts:
- The first part will be the first character of `string`.
- The second part will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Since the exact value of `string` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the first and the rest of the characters in `string`.

Output: **[first character of string], [rest of string starting from the second character]**
