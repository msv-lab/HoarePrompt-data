Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem described:

1. **Edge Case Handling for Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO". This is correct.

2. **Handling Strings with All Characters the Same**: The program correctly identifies that a string where all characters are the same cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO". This is correct.

3. **Handling Strings with One Different Character**: The program attempts to handle strings where all but one character are the same, but it has a logical error. Specifically, the condition `if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:` is incorrect. This condition checks if the middle character is different when the length is odd, but it should also check if the different character is not in the middle. For example, the string "aaabaaa" should be partitioned into "aaab" and "aaa" (or similar), but the program incorrectly prints "NO".

4. **General Case Handling**: The program's logic for handling general cases is overly complex and prone to errors. It attempts to find a non-palindromic partition by checking pairs of characters, but it does not always correctly identify valid partitions. For example, the string "abccba" should be partitioned into "ab" and "ccba" (or similar), but the program might not correctly identify this.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the string is already non-palindromic
        if string != string[::-1]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            continue
        
        # Try to partition the string into two non-palindromic parts
        for i in range(1, n):
            part1 = string[:i]
            part2 = string[i:]
            if part1 != part1[::-1] and part2 != part2[::-1]:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(part1, part2)
                break
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Single Character String**: If the string has only one character, it prints "NO" because a single character is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
2. **Already Non-Palindromic String**: If the string is already non-palindromic, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
3. **Partition into Two Non-Palindromic Substrings**: It tries to partition the string into two parts at each possible position. If both parts are non-palindromic, it prints "YES" and the two parts.
4. **No Valid Partition**: If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".

This corrected version should handle all cases correctly as per the problem description.
