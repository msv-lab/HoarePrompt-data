The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer, which means it must be within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) for the loop to execute. The variable `i` starts at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
