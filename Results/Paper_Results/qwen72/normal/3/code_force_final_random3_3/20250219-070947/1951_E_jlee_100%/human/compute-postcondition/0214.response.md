Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise.
- `count2` is greater than `count`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`j` is 0**: This means that the slicing operation `string[:j]` will return an empty string because it slices from the start of the string up to (but not including) index 0.
2. **`string[j:]`**: Since `j` is 0, this will return the entire string starting from index 0 to the end of the string.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print an empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Output: **'' [string] (where [string] is the entire string `string`)**
