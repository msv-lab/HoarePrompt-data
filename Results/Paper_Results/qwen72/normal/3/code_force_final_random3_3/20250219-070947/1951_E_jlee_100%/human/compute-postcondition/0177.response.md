Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is the new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False.** 

The code snippet `count2 = 0` resets the value of `count2` to 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
