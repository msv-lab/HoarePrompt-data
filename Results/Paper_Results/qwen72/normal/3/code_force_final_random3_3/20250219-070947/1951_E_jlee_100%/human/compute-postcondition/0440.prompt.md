Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s` where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
            continue
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x` was found, and `done` is False if the loop has not found a condition to print 'YES' and break. Otherwise, `done` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`, `count` is greater than or equal to 0, and `count2` is either unchanged or increased by 1. If `done` was initially False, it remains False after the if block. If `done` was initially True, it remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is `n-1`, `done` is `True` or `False` depending on the conditions within the loop, `count` and `count2` are updated as per the loop logic, `string` and `s` remain unchanged, `n` remains the length of `string`. If `done` is `False`, `j` is `n-1`, `done` is `False`, `count` and `count2` are updated as per the loop logic, `string` and `s` remain unchanged, `n` remains the length of `string`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
