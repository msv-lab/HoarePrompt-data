Postcondition: ***`j` is `n-1`, `done` is `True` or `False` depending on the conditions within the loop, `count` and `count2` are updated as per the loop logic, `string` and `s` remain unchanged, `n` remains the length of `string`. If `done` is `False`, `j` is `n-1`, `done` is `False`, `count` and `count2` are updated as per the loop logic, `string` and `s` remain unchanged, `n` remains the length of `string`.***
