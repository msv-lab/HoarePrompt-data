Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `count` is 0.**

The value of `count` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected. The conditions and values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
