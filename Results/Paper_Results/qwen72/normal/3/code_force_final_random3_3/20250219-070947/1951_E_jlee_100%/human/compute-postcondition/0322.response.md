The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is set to `n-1`, but for the loop to execute, `j` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is the length of `string` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
