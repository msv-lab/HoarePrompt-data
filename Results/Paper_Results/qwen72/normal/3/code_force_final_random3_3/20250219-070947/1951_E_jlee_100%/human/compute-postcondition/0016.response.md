Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `n` is 1, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
