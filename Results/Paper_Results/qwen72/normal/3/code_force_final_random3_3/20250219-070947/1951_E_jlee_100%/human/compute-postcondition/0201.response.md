Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 1.
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]` and remains unchanged otherwise.
   - `count2` is equal to `count`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about various variables, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
