Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `k` is 0.**

The code snippet `k = 0` sets the variable `k` to 0, overriding any previous value it might have had. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `k` and retains the initial values of the other variables.
