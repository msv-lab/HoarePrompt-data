Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all the constraints and requirements of the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program checks if `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`. This condition is intended to check if it's impossible to form complete groups of 3 for extroverts, but it is not sufficient.
   - The correct approach should be to first ensure that all extroverts can be placed in groups of 3. If `b % 3 == 0`, then all extroverts can be placed in complete groups. If `b % 3 != 0`, then we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the incomplete group(s).

2. **Calculating the Number of Tents:**
   - The program calculates the number of tents as `k += a + (b + c) // 3` and then adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. This is incorrect because it does not properly account for the specific requirements of introverts and extroverts.
   - The correct approach should be:
     - First, allocate tents for all introverts (`a` tents).
     - Then, try to form complete groups of 3 for extroverts using universals if necessary.
     - Finally, allocate the remaining universals in the most efficient way to minimize the number of tents.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when there are not enough universals to form complete groups for extroverts.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Tents for introverts
        k = a
        
        # Tents for extroverts
        if b % 3 == 0:
            k += b // 3
        else:
            k += b // 3 + 1
            c -= 3 - (b % 3)
            if c < 0:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
        # Tents for remaining universals
        k += (c + 2) // 3
        
        print(k)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Tents for Introverts:**
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent, so we add `a` to the total number of tents `k`.

2. **Tents for Extroverts:**
   - If `b % 3 == 0`, all extroverts can be placed in complete groups of 3, so we add `b // 3` to `k`.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, we need one more tent to accommodate the remaining extroverts. We also need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in this tent. If not, we print `-1` and continue to the next test case.

3. **Tents for Remaining Universals:**
   - After accommodating introverts and extroverts, we allocate the remaining universals in the most efficient way. Each tent can hold up to 3 universals, so we add `(c + 2) // 3` to `k`.

This corrected program should handle all test cases correctly and efficiently.
