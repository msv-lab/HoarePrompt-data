Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, and the remaining extroverts cannot be paired with universals to form a tent of 3 people. Specifically, the condition `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:` is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in the tent.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 4 1
```
- There is 1 introvert, 4 extroverts, and 1 universal.
- The introvert will need 1 tent.
- The 4 extroverts need to be in tents of 3 people each. However, 4 % 3 = 1, and there is only 1 universal available, which is not enough to form a tent of 3 people with the remaining extrovert.

The program incorrectly outputs `-1` for this case, but it should output `3` because the 1 universal can be paired with 2 extroverts in one tent, and the remaining extrovert can be paired with the introvert in another tent.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
