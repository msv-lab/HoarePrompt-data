### Reasoning:

1. **Introverts (a):**
   - Each introvert requires a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents required for introverts is simply `a`.

2. **Extroverts (b):**
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. This means that the number of extroverts must be a multiple of 3 for them to be fully accommodated. If `b % 3 != 0`, then there will be some extroverts left without a complete group of three, which is a problem.

3. **Universals (c):**
   - Universals can be placed in any tent configuration. They can be used to fill the remaining spots in tents with extroverts or to form their own tents.

4. **Tent Calculation:**
   - If `b % 3 == 0`, then all extroverts can be perfectly grouped into tents of three. The number of tents required for extroverts is `b // 3`.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, then we need to check if there are enough universals to complete the groups. Specifically, we need `3 - (b % 3)` universals to complete the last group of extroverts. If `c < 3 - (b % 3)`, it is impossible to accommodate all extroverts, and the function should output `-1`.
   - If there are enough universals to complete the groups, the remaining universals can be placed in any tent configuration. The total number of tents required is `a + (b + c) // 3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `b == 0`, then the number of tents required is simply `a + c // 3` (since all universals can be placed in tents of up to three people).
   - If `a == 0` and `b == 0`, then the number of tents required is `c // 3` (since all universals can be placed in tents of up to three people).

6. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly checks if it is possible to accommodate all extroverts by verifying if `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`. If this condition is true, it prints `-1`.
   - The program then calculates the total number of tents required as `a + (b + c) // 3` and adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0` to account for any remaining universals that need a tent.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the given problem and edge cases. It ensures that all participants are accommodated according to their preferences and outputs the minimum number of tents required or `-1` if it is impossible.

**Correctness: True**
