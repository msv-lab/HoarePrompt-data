### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Introverts:**
   - Each introvert requires a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents needed for introverts is `a`.

3. **Extroverts:**
   - Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two other people. Therefore, the number of tents needed for extroverts is `b // 3` (full tents) plus any remaining extroverts that need to be accommodated.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, there will be some extroverts left over that need to be paired with others. These can be accommodated using universals.

4. **Universals:**
   - Universals can be used to fill the remaining spots in tents that have extroverts or to form their own tents.
   - The program checks if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the available universals. Specifically, it checks if `b % 3 + c < 3`. If this condition is true, it means there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts, and the program outputs `-1`.

5. **Tent Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of tents needed as `a + (b + c) // 3`.
   - If there are any remaining participants after forming the tents, it adds one more tent to accommodate them.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of tents for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it is impossible to form a tent with the remaining extroverts and universals.
  - If `b % 3 == 0`, the program correctly calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

- **General Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where all participants can be accommodated according to their preferences.
  - The calculation `a + (b + c) // 3` ensures that introverts are given their own tents and the remaining participants are accommodated in the minimum number of tents.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the given constraints and edge cases correctly. It ensures that introverts are given their own tents, extroverts are paired with others, and universals are used to fill any remaining spots. The logic is sound and the output is correct for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
