The function should accept three parameters: t, a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple containing two integers n and m, and a string a representing the difficulties of the problems. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.
