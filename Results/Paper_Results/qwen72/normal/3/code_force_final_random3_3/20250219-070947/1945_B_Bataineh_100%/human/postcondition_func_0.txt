The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the user. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, it prints a specific integer result for each test case. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result of each test case to the console. After the function concludes, `t` is equal to the number of test cases processed, `i` is `t - 1`, and `a`, `b`, and `m` hold the values of the last test case. The final state of the program is that the function has printed the results for all `t` test cases.
