Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2, because no two fireworks from the same installation can overlap, but one from each installation can.
   - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than or equal to `b`, the program calculates the number of fireworks from the second installation that can be visible at the same time as one from the first installation. This is done by adding 2 (one from each installation) to the number of fireworks from the second installation that can fit within `m` minutes, which is `m // b`.
   - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, the program does the same as above but for the first installation, adding 2 to `m // a`.
   - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, the program calculates the total number of fireworks from both installations that can be visible at the same time, which is `m // a + m // b + 2`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

The logic in the program aligns with the problem description and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
