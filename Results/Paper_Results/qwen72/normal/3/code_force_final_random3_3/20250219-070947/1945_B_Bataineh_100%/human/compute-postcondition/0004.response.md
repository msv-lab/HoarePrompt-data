The given code snippet is:
```
print(2)
```

In the initial state, we have the following information:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.
- The current value of `m` is less than both `a` and `b`.

However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
