### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input.

2. **Logic for Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks**:
   - The program uses a series of conditional statements to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - **Case 1**: `if m < a and m < b`
     - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2. This is because the visibility period of each firework is less than the launch intervals of both installations, so no two fireworks from different installations can overlap in visibility.
   - **Case 2**: `elif m < a and m > b`
     - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `2 + m // b`. This is because the visibility period of each firework from the second installation can overlap with the firework from the first installation, and the number of fireworks from the second installation that can be seen simultaneously is `m // b`.
   - **Case 3**: `elif m < b and m > a`
     - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `2 + m // a`. This is because the visibility period of each firework from the first installation can overlap with the firework from the second installation, and the number of fireworks from the first installation that can be seen simultaneously is `m // a`.
   - **Case 4**: `else`
     - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is because the visibility period of each firework can overlap with the fireworks from both installations, and the number of fireworks from each installation that can be seen simultaneously is `m // a` and `m // b` respectively, plus the initial two fireworks launched at the start.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

### Correctness:
The program's logic is correct and aligns with the problem description. It correctly handles all the cases and produces the expected output based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
