The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. However, these conditions do not directly affect the loop's execution, as the loop's execution depends solely on `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
