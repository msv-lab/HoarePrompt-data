Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are the input integers provided by the user. If `m` is less than `b` and greater than `a`, `m` remains unchanged. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `m` remains unchanged regardless of its relationship to `a` and `b`.***
