The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it appears that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`. The function likely accepts these parameters in some form, possibly as a list of tuples or similar structure.

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers with the constraint 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the example. Given the constraints, a common functionality for such a function might be to perform some operation involving `a`, `b`, and `m` and return the result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided.**
