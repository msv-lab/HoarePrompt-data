Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are the input integers provided by the user. If the new `m` is less than both the new `a` and the new `b`, the current value of `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `m` remains unchanged regardless of its relationship to `a` and `b`.**
