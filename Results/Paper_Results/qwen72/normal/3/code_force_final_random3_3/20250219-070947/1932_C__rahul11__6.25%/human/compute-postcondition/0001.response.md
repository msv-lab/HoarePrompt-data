The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop iteration. For the loop to execute, the range must have at least one value. The range is determined by the input, which is expected to be an integer. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. This means the input to the loop should be `t`.

To ensure the loop can execute, the input must be at least 1. Since `t` is already defined as being at least 1, the state does not need to be adjusted for `_` or the input. However, for clarity, we can state that the input must be `t` and that `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, the input to the loop is `t` which must be greater than 0**
