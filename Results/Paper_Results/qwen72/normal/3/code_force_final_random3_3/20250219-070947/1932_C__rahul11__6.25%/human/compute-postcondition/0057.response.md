The only objects in the loop head are the list `arr` and the variable `i`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, and `i` has taken the value of `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will now take the value of `m`, and `arr` must still have at least two elements.

State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans * n`**
