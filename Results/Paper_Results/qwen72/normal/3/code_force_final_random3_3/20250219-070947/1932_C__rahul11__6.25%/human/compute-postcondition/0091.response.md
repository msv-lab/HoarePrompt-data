Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD` (based on the old value of `ans`), `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD` (based on the old value of `ans`), `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD` (based on the old value of `ans`), `l` is `l + 1`, `k` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `res[c] = ans % m % MOD` updates the value of `res[c]` to `ans % m % MOD`.
- Since `c` is increased by 1, the new value of `res[c]` is based on the old value of `ans`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
