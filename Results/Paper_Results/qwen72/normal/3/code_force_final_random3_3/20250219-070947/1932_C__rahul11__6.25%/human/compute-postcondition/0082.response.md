Output State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `k`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `res[c]` to `ans % m % MOD`.
- The value of `c` is increased by 1.
- All other variables (`arr`, `i`, `ans`, `res[0]`, `res[1]`, `l`, `r`, `k`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, which is the same as `res[0]` and `res[1]` based on the initial state.
