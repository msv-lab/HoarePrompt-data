Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is 0, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, `ans` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` and `MOD` remain unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    ans *= i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is 0, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, `ans` is `i`, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` and `MOD` remain unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is 0, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, `ans` is the next element in `arr` multiplied by `i`, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` and `MOD` remain unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is `n - 1`, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is 0, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, `ans` is the product of the next element in `arr` multiplied by the next element in `arr` and the next element in `arr`, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
