Output State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `k`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`. Since `l` is 1, `arr[l]` is `m`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `ans // m % MOD`.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `res[0]`, `res[1]`, `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- `c` is increased by 1.
- The condition `n` must be greater than `k` remains valid as `k` is `n - 1`.
