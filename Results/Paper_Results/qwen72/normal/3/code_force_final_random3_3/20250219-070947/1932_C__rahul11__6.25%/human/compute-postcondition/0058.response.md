The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * i`. Given that `i` is `m` and `ans` was previously updated to `ans * n`, the new value of `ans` is `ans * n * m`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans * n * m`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans * n * m`.**
