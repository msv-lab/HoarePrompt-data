Output State: **`arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `n`, `ans` is updated to `ans * n * n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the value of `ans` is now `ans * n * n`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
