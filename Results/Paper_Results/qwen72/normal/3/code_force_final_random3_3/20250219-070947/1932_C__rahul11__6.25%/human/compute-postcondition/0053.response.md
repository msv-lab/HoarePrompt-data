Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` provided by the user input, `n` is the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the user input, `s` is a list of characters from the user input, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is initialized to 0, `ans` is the final value of `n * m` after being modified by the loop, `i` is `m`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - (n - 1 - l)`, `k` is `n - 2`.**
