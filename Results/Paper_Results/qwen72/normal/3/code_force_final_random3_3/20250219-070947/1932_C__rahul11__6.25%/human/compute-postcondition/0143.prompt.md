Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `res` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are 0, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is 2, `l` is 0 if `s[k]` is not 'L' and 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[k]` is 'L' and `n - 2` if `s[k]` is not 'L', `res` is a list of length `n` where the first and second elements are `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first element if `s[k]` is 'L' and except the last element if `s[k]` is not 'L', `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user, and `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is 3, `l` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'L' and 0 if `s[1]` is not 'L', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `n - 2` if `s[1]` is not 'L', `res` is a list of length `n` where the first and second elements are `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[1]` is 'L', the third element of `res` is `ans // arr[l] % m % MOD`. If `s[1]` is not 'L', the third element of `res` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`. The rest of the elements in `res` are 0. `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first element if `s[1]` is 'L' and except the last element if `s[1]` is not 'L'. `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user, and `k` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is 4, `l` is 2 if `s[1]` is 'L' and 0 if `s[1]` is not 'L', `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L' and `n - 3` if `s[1]` is not 'L', `res` is a list of length `n` where the first and second elements are `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[1]` is 'L', the third element of `res` is `ans // arr[l-1] % m % MOD` and the fourth element of `res` is `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[1]` is not 'L', the third element of `res` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and the fourth element of `res` is `ans % m % MOD`. The rest of the elements in `res` are 0. `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the first element if `s[1]` is 'L' and except the last element if `s[1]` is not 'L'. `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least 3, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user, and `k` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
