Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD` before the update, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD` before the update, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD` before the update, `l` is `l + 1`, `k` is 0**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the value of `ans // arr[l] % MOD`.
- `arr[l]` is the element at index `l` in the list `arr`. Since `l` is `l + 1`, the value of `l` is now one more than its initial value.
- The values of `res[0]`, `res[1]`, and `res[c]` are based on the value of `ans` before the update, so they remain the same.
- The values of `c`, `i`, and `k` are not affected by the code.
- The list `arr` and the value of `n` remain unchanged.
