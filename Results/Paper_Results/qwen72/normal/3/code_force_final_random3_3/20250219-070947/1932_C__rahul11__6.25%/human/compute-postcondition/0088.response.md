Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `arr` is a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input, `i` is `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD` before the update, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD` before the update, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD` after the update, `l` is `l + 1`, `k` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
- The value of `c` is increased by 1.
- The value of `arr` remains a list of two integers `[n, m]` where `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is the second integer from the user input.
- The value of `i` remains `m`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`.
- The values of `res[0]` and `res[1]` remain `ans % m % MOD` before the update.
- The value of `l` is increased by 1.
- The value of `k` remains 0.
