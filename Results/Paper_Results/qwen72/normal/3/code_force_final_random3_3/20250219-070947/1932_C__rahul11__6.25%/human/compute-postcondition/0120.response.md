Output State: **`c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `res` is a list of length `n` where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are 0, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` except the last element, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `MOD` remains unchanged, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters input by the user, `k` is 0, and `s[k]` is not 'L'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
- `arr[r]` is the last element in `arr` because `r` is `n - 1`.
- The division `ans // arr[r]` removes the last element from the product of all elements in `arr`.
- The modulo operation `% MOD` ensures that the result is within the bounds defined by `MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
