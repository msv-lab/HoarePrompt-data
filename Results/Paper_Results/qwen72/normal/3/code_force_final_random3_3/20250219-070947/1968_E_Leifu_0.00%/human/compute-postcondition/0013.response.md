The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `j` being within the range from 4 to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5 and `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 6, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 6 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
