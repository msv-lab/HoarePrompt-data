Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.
- If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('2 4')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement `print('2 4')` is a simple string literal that does not depend on any variables or conditions.
- The string `'2 4'` is hardcoded and will be printed exactly as it is, regardless of the values of `n`, `t`, `i`, or `j`.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'2 4'` exactly as it is.
Output: **2 4**
