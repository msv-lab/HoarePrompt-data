Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `j` is 6.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break down the execution step by step:

1. `j` is explicitly given as 6.
2. `str(j)` converts the integer `j` to a string, resulting in the string `'6'`.
3. The `print` statement concatenates the string `'6'` with a space `' '` and another `'6'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **6 6**
