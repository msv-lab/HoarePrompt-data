### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to choose \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and prints a set of \( n \) points.
   - The program prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) for every test case.
   - If \( n = 3 \), it prints the point \((2, 3)\).
   - If \( n > 3 \), it prints the point \((2, 4)\) and then prints points \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).

3. **Evaluating the Program for Different \( n \):**
   - **For \( n = 2 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct and maximized for \( n = 2 \).

   - **For \( n = 3 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
     - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct and maximized for \( n = 3 \).

   - **For \( n > 3 \):**
     - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).
     - Let's evaluate the set of distinct Manhattan distances:
       - The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) is 1.
       - The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 4)\) is \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
       - The distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 4)\) is \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3 \).
       - The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((j, j)\) for \( j \geq 4 \) is \( |1-j| + |1-j| = 2(j-1) \).
       - The distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((j, j)\) for \( j \geq 4 \) is \( |1-j| + |2-j| = 2(j-1) - 1 \).
       - The distance between \((2, 4)\) and \((j, j)\) for \( j \geq 4 \) is \( |2-j| + |4-j| = 2(j-2) - 2 \).
       - The distance between any two points \((j, j)\) and \((k, k)\) for \( j, k \geq 4 \) is \( |j-k| + |j-k| = 2|j-k| \).

   - **Checking the Distances:**
     - The distances \( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, \ldots, 2(n-1) \) are all distinct and cover a wide range.
     - However, the program does not ensure that all possible distances from 0 to \( 2(n-1) \) are covered, which is necessary to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

4. **Example for \( n = 4 \):**
   - The program prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\).
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 3, 4, 6\}\).
   - The distance 2 is missing, and the set of distances is not maximized.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \( n > 3 \). The original assessment correctly identified that the program fails to cover all possible distances for \( n > 3 \).
