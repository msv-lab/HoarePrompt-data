The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` based on user input. The previous value of `n` is overwritten, and the new value of `n` is the integer input provided by the user. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. If the new value of `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables as per the initial condition. If the new value of `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `n` is 3, there are no changes to the variables. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n`.**
