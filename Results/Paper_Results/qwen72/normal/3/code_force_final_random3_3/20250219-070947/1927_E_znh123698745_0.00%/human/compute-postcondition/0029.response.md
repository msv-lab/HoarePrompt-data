Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list that alternates between the first and last elements of `array` until all elements from 1 to `n` are included, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

The code `array = list(range(1, n + 1))` reassigns `array` to a new list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.
