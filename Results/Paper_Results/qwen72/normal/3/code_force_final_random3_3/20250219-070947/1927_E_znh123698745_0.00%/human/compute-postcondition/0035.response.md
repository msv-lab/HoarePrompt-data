Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[-1]`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2.**

The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Initially, `a` contains the integers 1 and -1. After the code execution, the last element of `a` is now -2. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
