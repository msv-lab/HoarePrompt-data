Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, and `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, either `array[-1]` or `array[0]`, and either `array[a[-1] - 1]` or `array[a[0]]`, depending on whether `a[-1]` was initially `0` or `n-1`. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, the value of `a[-1]` is now `a[-1] - 1`. Otherwise, `answer` also contains `array[a[0]]`, and `a[0]` is now 2.***
