Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing only the integer 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, and the current value of `i` is 1, which means `(-1) ** i` is -1.**
