Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `array[-1]`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `(-1)` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`.
- The list `a` contains the integers 1 and -1, so `a[-1]` is -1.
- The list `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, so `array[-1]` is the last element of `array`, which is `n`.
- Therefore, `answer` is updated to contain the integers 1 and `n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
