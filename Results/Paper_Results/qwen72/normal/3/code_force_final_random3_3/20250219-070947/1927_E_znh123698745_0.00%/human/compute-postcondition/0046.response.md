The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input positive integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 2, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, and `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, either `array[-1]` or `array[0]`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]`, depending on whether `(-1)`**
