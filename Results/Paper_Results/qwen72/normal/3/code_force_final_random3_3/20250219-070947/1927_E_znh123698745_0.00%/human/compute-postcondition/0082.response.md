Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The initial value of `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). This variable represents the number of test cases.
- **`_`**: After all iterations of the loop, `_` will be `t-1` because the loop runs `t` times, and `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time.
- **`n` and `k`**: These variables are input for each test case and remain unchanged within their respective test case. They are positive integers where 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and k is even.
- **`array`**: For each test case, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which is created at the start of each iteration.
- **`i`**: After the inner loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the inner loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- **`answer`**: The `answer` list for each test case will contain the integers from 1 to `n` in an alternating pattern starting with 1. This means the list will look like `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ...]` depending on the value of `n`.
- **`a`**: The `a` list will contain the integers `n` and `-n` after the inner loop completes. This is because the `a` list is updated in such a way that `a[0]` starts at 1 and increments to `n`, while `a[1]` starts at -1 and decrements to `-n`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after all `t` test cases have been processed.
