Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list that now includes the value of `array[a[-1]]`.**

The code snippet appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. The value of `a[-1]` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value being appended to `answer`. However, since `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the appended value will be one of these integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
