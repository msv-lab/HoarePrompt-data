The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value at the index `a[0]` of the list `array` to the list `answer`.

- `a[0]` is 1.
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, so `array[1]` is the second element of `array`, which is 2.
- `answer` initially contains only the integer 1.

After executing the code, the value 2 is appended to `answer`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input positive integer greater than 1, `k` is an input positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1.**
