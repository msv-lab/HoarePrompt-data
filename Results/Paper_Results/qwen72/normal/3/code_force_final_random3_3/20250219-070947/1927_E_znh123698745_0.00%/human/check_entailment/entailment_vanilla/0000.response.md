### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation of length \( n \) such that the sums of all continuous segments of length \( k \) differ by no more than 1.
   - \( k \) is guaranteed to be even, and \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \) test cases are given.
   - The constraints ensure that \( 2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and the sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It initializes `answer` with the first element of `array` and a list `a` with two elements: 1 and -1.
   - It then iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) to construct the permutation:
     - If \( (-1)^i \) is -1 (i.e., \( i \) is odd), it appends the element at index `a[-1]` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - If \( (-1)^i \) is 1 (i.e., \( i \) is even), it appends the element at index `a[0]` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program starts with the first element of the permutation.
   - For odd indices, it appends the largest remaining element.
   - For even indices, it appends the smallest remaining element.
   - This alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) are balanced, as it alternates between the smallest and largest elements.

4. **Verifying the Output:**
   - The output is a permutation of length \( n \).
   - The sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) should differ by no more than 1.
   - The alternating pattern helps in balancing the sums, ensuring that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any \( k \)-length segment is at most 1.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the smallest possible \( n \) and \( k \) (e.g., \( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \)).
   - It also handles larger values of \( n \) and \( k \) within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a \( k \)-level permutation for the given problem. The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) are balanced, meeting the requirement that any two sums differ by no more than 1.

Correctness: **True**
