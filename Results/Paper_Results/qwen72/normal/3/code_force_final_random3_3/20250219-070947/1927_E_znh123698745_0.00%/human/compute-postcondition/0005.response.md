The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, as the range function will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. The variable `i` will start at 1 for the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The state of `i` is not something that needs to be explicitly adjusted since it is initialized by the loop itself, but we can state its initial value for clarity.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `i` is 1**
