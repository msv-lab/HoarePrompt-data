#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters, but the problem description implies that the function will be called multiple times with different inputs. Each input consists of four non-negative integers p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 (0 \le p_i \le 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The function should be designed to handle these inputs internally, possibly through a loop or a series of test cases.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: 4
    #4
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple lines of input, each containing four non-negative integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each line, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. The function does not return any value.
