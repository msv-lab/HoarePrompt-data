You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters, but the problem description implies that the function will be called multiple times with different inputs. Each input consists of four non-negative integers p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 (0 \le p_i \le 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The function should be designed to handle these inputs internally, possibly through a loop or a series of test cases.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: 4
    #4



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is between 1 and 4.
   - The game is played multiple times, and after each game, one number is removed from the sequence.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the set can be partitioned into pairs of identical numbers.
   - For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, the XOR properties are:
     - \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
     - \(2 \oplus 2 = 0\)
     - \(3 \oplus 3 = 0\)
     - \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\)
     - \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 1\)
     - \(2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 1\)

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as often as possible.
   - This can be achieved by removing numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence can be partitioned into pairs of identical numbers or specific combinations that result in zero XOR.

4. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
   - The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win using the formula:
     \[
     \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum(3 \times (x // 2) + x \% 2 \times (i < 3))}{3} \right\rfloor
     \]
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - \( x // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of each number.
     - \( x \% 2 \) gives the remainder when \( x \) is divided by 2, which is 1 if \( x \) is odd and 0 if \( x \) is even.
     - \( 3 \times (x // 2) \) accounts for the pairs, as each pair can be removed without affecting the XOR.
     - \( x \% 2 \times (i < 3) \) adds 1 for each odd count of 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4), as these can be used to balance the XOR to zero.

5. **Verification**:
   - The formula correctly accounts for the pairs and the odd counts of 1, 2, and 3.
   - The division by 3 ensures that the result is the maximum number of times Bob can win, as each win requires a combination that results in zero XOR.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
