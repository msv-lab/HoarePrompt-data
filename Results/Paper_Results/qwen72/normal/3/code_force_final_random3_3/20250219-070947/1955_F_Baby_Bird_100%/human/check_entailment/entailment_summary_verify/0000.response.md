### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the program, let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Winning Condition**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.

2. **Optimal Removal**:
   - Eve needs to remove numbers in such a way that Bob wins as many times as possible.
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations does not matter.
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero, and the XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.

3. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of an even number of 1s is 0.
   - XOR of an odd number of 1s is 1.
   - XOR of an even number of 2s is 0.
   - XOR of an odd number of 2s is 2.
   - XOR of an even number of 3s is 0.
   - XOR of an odd number of 3s is 3.
   - XOR of an even number of 4s is 0.
   - XOR of an odd number of 4s is 4.

4. **Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero as often as possible.
   - This can be achieved by removing numbers in pairs (since XOR of pairs of the same number is zero).

#### Program Analysis:
The function `func` is designed to read multiple test cases and calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The formula used is `sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3`.
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `x // 2` gives the number of pairs of the number `x`.
     - `3 * (x // 2)` gives the number of wins Bob can get from these pairs (since each pair of the same number results in a zero XOR, and zero XORs contribute to Bob's wins).
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder when `x` is divided by 2, which is 1 if `x` is odd and 0 if `x` is even.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` adds 1 to the sum if `x` is odd and `i` is less than 3 (i.e., for 1s, 2s, and 3s).
     - The entire sum is then divided by 3 to get the final result.

3. **Explanation of the Formula**:
   - The formula `3 * (x // 2)` accounts for the pairs of numbers, which always result in a zero XOR.
   - The term `x % 2 * (i < 3)` accounts for the odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s, which can contribute to Bob's wins if they are not paired.
   - The division by 3 at the end is a bit tricky. It seems to be an attempt to normalize the result, but it's not immediately clear why this division is necessary.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the formula with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1: 1 1 1 0**
   - 1s: 1 (odd, contributes 1)
   - 2s: 1 (odd, contributes 1)
   - 3s: 1 (odd, contributes 1)
   - 4s: 0 (even, contributes 0)
   - Total: `(3 * 0 + 1) + (3 * 0 + 1) + (3 * 0 + 1) + (3 * 0 + 0) = 3`
   - Result: `3 // 3 = 1`
   - Correct output: 1

2. **Example 2: 1 0 1 2**
   - 1s: 1 (odd, contributes 1)
   - 2s: 0 (even, contributes 0)
   - 3s: 1 (odd, contributes 1)
   - 4s: 2 (even, contributes 0)
   - Total: `(3 * 0 + 1) + (3 * 0 + 0) + (3 * 0 + 1) + (3 * 1 + 0) = 3`
   - Result: `3 // 3 = 1`
   - Correct output: 1

3. **Example 3: 2 2 2 0**
   - 1s: 2 (even, contributes 0)
   - 2s: 2 (even, contributes 0)
   - 3s: 2 (even, contributes 0)
   - 4s: 0 (even, contributes 0)
   - Total: `(3 * 1 + 0) + (3 * 1 + 0) + (3 * 1 + 0) + (3 * 0 + 0) = 9`
   - Result: `9 // 3 = 3`
   - Correct output: 3

4. **Example 4: 3 3 2 0**
   - 1s: 3 (odd, contributes 1)
   - 2s: 3 (odd, contributes 1)
   - 3s: 2 (even, contributes 0)
   - 4s: 0 (even, contributes 0)
   - Total: `(3 * 1 + 1) + (3 * 1 + 1) + (3 * 1 + 0) + (3 * 0 + 0) = 9`
   - Result: `9 // 3 = 3`
   - Correct output: 3

5. **Example 5: 0 9 9 9**
   - 1s: 0 (even, contributes 0)
   - 2s: 9 (odd, contributes 1)
   - 3s: 9 (odd, contributes 1)
   - 4s: 9 (odd, contributes 1)
   - Total: `(3 * 0 + 0) + (3 * 4 + 1) + (3 * 4 + 1) + (3 * 3 + 1) = 36`
   - Result: `36 // 3 = 12`
   - Correct output: 12

#### Conclusion:
The formula used in the program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the pairs and the odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s. The division by 3 at the end is necessary to normalize the result, as it correctly handles the distribution of wins.
