The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly, but the context implies that it operates with predefined variables `t`, `n`, and `s`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B'. The function returns the value of `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in the string `s` from the start, and `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function returns the value of `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in the string `s` and `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`.**
