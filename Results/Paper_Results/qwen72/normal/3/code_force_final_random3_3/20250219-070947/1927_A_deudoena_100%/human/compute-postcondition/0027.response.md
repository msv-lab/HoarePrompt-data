Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0 if the last character in `s` is not 'B', otherwise `ma` is `n` - 1, `m` is an input integer, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, and the last character in `s` is 'B' if the condition `j == 'B'` is true. If the last character in `s` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
