You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Annotated Code:

    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B'.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B', `m` is an input integer, `c` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the end, `l` is an empty list, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in `s`, and `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in `s` from the start.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the value of `ma - mi + 2`, where `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in the string `s` from the start, and `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads two inputs: an integer `m` and a string `s` of length `n` (1 <= n <= 10) consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B'. It calculates the distance between the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` and returns this distance plus 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `n`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the strip, `m`, and the string `s` representing the strip.
   - It initializes variables `ma` and `mi` to 0, which are intended to store the positions of the first and last black cells, respectively.
   - It also initializes `c` and `d` to 0, which are used to count the positions of the first and last black cells.

3. **Finding the First Black Cell:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from the beginning.
   - It increments `c` for each cell and checks if the cell is black (`'B'`).
   - When it finds the first black cell, it sets `mi` to `c` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Finding the Last Black Cell:**
   - The program then iterates through the string `s` from the end.
   - It increments `d` for each cell and checks if the cell is black (`'B'`).
   - When it finds the last black cell, it sets `ma` to `len(s) - d` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length:**
   - The program returns `ma - mi + 2` as the result.
   - This calculation is intended to find the length of the segment that includes the first and last black cells.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation:**
  - The calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` to include both the first and last black cells in the segment.
  - For example, if the first black cell is at position 2 and the last black cell is at position 5, the segment length should be `5 - 2 + 1 = 4`, not `5 - 2 + 2 = 5`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle the case where there is only one black cell correctly. In such a case, the segment length should be 1, but the current implementation might return an incorrect value.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    mi = len(s) + 1  # Initialize to a value greater than any possible index
    ma = 0  # Initialize to 0
    for j in range(len(s)):
        if s[j] == 'B':
            mi = min(mi, j + 1)  # Find the first black cell
            ma = max(ma, j + 1)  # Find the last black cell
    return ma - mi + 1  # Correct calculation for the segment length
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the flawed calculation of the segment length.
- The corrected program should work correctly for all valid inputs as described in the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
