Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem by checking if either dimension of the rectangle is even. If at least one dimension is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a different rectangle (considering rotations). If both dimensions are odd, it is not possible to form a different rectangle because cutting an odd-dimensioned rectangle will result in smaller rectangles that, when rearranged, will only form the original rectangle or its rotation.

The logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
