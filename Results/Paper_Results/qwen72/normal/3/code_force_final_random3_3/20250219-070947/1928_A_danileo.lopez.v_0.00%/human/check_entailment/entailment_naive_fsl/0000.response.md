Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both dimensions of the rectangle are odd but still can form another rectangle. For example, consider a rectangle of size 3 \times 3. According to the problem description, this rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times 1 rectangles, and these can be used to form a 1 \times 6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3 \times 3 rectangle. However, the program will output "No" for this case because neither 3 nor 3 is even, which is incorrect.
