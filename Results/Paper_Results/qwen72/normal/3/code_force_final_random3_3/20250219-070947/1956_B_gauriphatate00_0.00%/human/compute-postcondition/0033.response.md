Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to handle `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `a` as arguments and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, `results` contains the results of `func_1` for each test case, and `idx` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`. **
