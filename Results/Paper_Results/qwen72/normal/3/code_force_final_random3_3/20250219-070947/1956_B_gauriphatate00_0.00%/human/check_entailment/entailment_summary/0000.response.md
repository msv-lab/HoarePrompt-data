Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function calculates the maximum number of points the player can get by playing optimally.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
     - It then calculates the number of pairs (integers that appear exactly twice) in the list `a`.
     - Finally, it returns the minimum value between the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly identifies the number of pairs in the player's hand.
     - The `min(pairs, n // 2)` ensures that the player cannot score more points than the number of pairs they have, and also cannot score more than half the total number of turns they have (since each turn can only score one point).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
     - It processes each test case by extracting `n` and the list `a` from the input data.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly reads and processes the input for multiple test cases.
     - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the results.
     - It prints the results in the correct format.

**Overall Correctness**:
- The program as a whole correctly handles the problem description. It processes multiple test cases, calculates the optimal score for each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.
- The input handling in `func_2` is appropriate for the given constraints and format.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
