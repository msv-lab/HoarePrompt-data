Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1 from the previous state), `n` is the integer value of `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the integer value of the corresponding string in `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `4 + 3n`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` appended twice.**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`.
- The initial value of `idx` was `4 + 2n`, so after the increment, `idx` becomes `4 + 2n + n`, which simplifies to `4 + 3n`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, and `results` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by the code snippet.
