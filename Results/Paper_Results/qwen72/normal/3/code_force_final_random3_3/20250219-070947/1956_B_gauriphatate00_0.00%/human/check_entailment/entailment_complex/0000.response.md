Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.
   - It counts the number of pairs (cards with the same integer) in your hand using a `Counter`.
   - The number of points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and `n // 2` (since you only get a point if the card you play matches a card already on the table, and you can only play `n` cards in total).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` with `n` and `a` as arguments and appends the result to `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading `n` and the list `a`.
   - The output is also correctly handled by printing each result in `results`.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. Since Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, the best strategy for you is to play pairs first (if you have them) to maximize your points.
   - The logic of `func_1` ensures that you only get points for pairs, and it correctly limits the number of points to `n // 2` because you can only play `n` cards in total.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where `n` is 1 or where there are no pairs in your hand.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where you have more pairs than `n // 2`.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
