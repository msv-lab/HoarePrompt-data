Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1 from the previous state), `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the integer value of the corresponding string in `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` appended twice.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- The previous value of `n` (which was a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) is no longer relevant.
- The other variables (`t`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, and `results`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial state.
