Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` must have at least one element.
- `result` is the first element in `results`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the first element of the `results` list.

Since the exact value of the first element in `results` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of its position in the list.

Output: **result (where result is the first element in the `results` list)**
