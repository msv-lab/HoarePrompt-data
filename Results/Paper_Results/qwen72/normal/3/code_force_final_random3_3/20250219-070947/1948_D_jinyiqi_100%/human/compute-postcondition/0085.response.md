The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s_list`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `s_list` is a list of strings, where each string is a test case. Each string `s` in `s_list` has a length between 1 and 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings in `s_list` does not exceed 5000. The function processes these test cases and returns a value based on the following conditions:

- **Case_1**: The function returns nothing if none of the conditions are met.
- **Case_2**: The function returns `count`, which is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`. If any of these conditions are true, `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` is set to 0.
- **Case_3**: The function returns `count`, which is either 0, 1, or 2, depending on whether `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`. If none of these conditions are met, `count` is 0.
- **Case_4**: The function returns nothing if none of the conditions are met.
- **Case_5**: The function returns nothing if none of the conditions are met.
- **Case_6**: The function does not return any value.
- **Case_7**: The function returns the current value of `count`, which is `j`.
- **Case_8**: The function returns nothing if none of the conditions are met.
- **Case_9**: The function returns `count`, which is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`. If any of these conditions are true, `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of strings `s_list`. It processes each string in `s_list` and returns a value of `count` based on specific conditions involving characters at positions `k` and `k + j` in the string. The function may return nothing, 0, 1, or 2 depending on the conditions, or it may return the value of `j` as `count`.**
