Output State: **`t` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 2, `n - j` must be greater than 2, `count` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
