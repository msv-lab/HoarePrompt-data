Postcondition: **`t` is 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s_list` is a list of strings where each string is a test case, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the number of characters in `s` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 0. If `s[0]` is '?', `s[j]` is '?', or `s[0]` is equal to `s[j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `s[0]` is not '?', `s[j]` is not '?', and `s[0]` is not equal to `s[j]`.**
