The code snippet `n = len(s)` assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` is now a list of characters from the input string, `n` will be the number of characters in the list `s`.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes a string `s` of length 1 to 5000, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000. The function should take an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s_list` where each string is a test case. `s` is now a list of characters from the input string, and `n` is the number of characters in `s`.**
