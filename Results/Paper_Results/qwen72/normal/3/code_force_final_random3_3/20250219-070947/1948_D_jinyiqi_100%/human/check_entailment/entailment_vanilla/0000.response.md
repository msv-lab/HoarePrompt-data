### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling the function `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads a string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.
   - It initializes `n` to the length of the string `s`.
   - The program then iterates over possible lengths of the first half of the tandem repeat, starting from `n // 2` down to `1`.

3. **Tandem Repeat Check:**
   - For each possible length `j` of the first half of the tandem repeat, the program initializes a counter `count` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the string `s` from the start to `n - j` (the end of the first half of the potential tandem repeat).
   - For each character `s[k]` and its corresponding character `s[k + j]` in the second half:
     - If either `s[k]` or `s[k + j]` is a question mark, or if they are the same character, it increments the `count`.
     - If they are different and neither is a question mark, it resets the `count` to 0.
   - If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the program prints `count * 2` and returns.

4. **No Tandem Repeat Found:**
   - If the loop completes without finding any tandem repeat, the program prints `0`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Tandem Repeat Check:**
  - The program correctly checks for tandem repeats by comparing the first half and the second half of the string.
  - It handles question marks by considering them as wildcards that can match any character, which is correct according to the problem statement.
  - The `count` variable is used to track the length of the current potential tandem repeat. If `count` reaches `j`, it means a valid tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where no tandem repeat can be formed by printing `0`.
  - It also handles the case where the string consists entirely of question marks by finding the longest possible tandem repeat.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, which is acceptable given the constraints \(1 \le |s| \le 5000\) and the total length of the strings over all test cases not exceeding 5000.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing question marks with lowercase Latin letters. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
