Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the logic for determining if the tower can have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution. 

The correct condition should be that the number of moves `n` and the target number of cubes `m` should have the same parity (both even or both odd) because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and starting from 0 cubes, the parity of the number of cubes will match the parity of the number of moves.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n % 2 == m % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity, which is the correct condition for the problem.
