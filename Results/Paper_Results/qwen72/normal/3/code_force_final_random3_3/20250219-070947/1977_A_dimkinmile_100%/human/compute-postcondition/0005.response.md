Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, where the input is a space-separated string of two integers. If the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative (i.e., (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0), the function proceeds with this condition. Otherwise, the difference between `n` and `m` is either not divisible by 2 or `n - m` is less than 0, and the function handles this alternative condition.**
