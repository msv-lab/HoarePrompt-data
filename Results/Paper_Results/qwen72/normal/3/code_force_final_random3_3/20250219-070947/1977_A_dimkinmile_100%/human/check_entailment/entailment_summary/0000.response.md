### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input for each test case.
   - It checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of moves to add cubes must be equal to the number of moves to remove cubes plus `m`.
   - This can be expressed as: `n = k + (k - m)` where `k` is the number of moves to add cubes.
   - Simplifying, we get: `n = 2k - m` or `n + m = 2k`.
   - Therefore, `n + m` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that `n + m` is even.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `n` is at least as large as `m`, which is necessary because you can't remove more cubes than you have.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is equal to `m` correctly, as `n - m` will be 0, which is even and non-negative.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is less than `m` correctly by printing "No" because it is impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions checked are appropriate and cover all necessary cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
