You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers p of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should be called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000).
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n + 1`, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: *The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct). The function is called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000). `n` is an input integer, and `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the input integers, with an additional 0 at the beginning. If `n` is 2, the current value of `n` remains 2. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is set to `n + 1`, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n`, representing the best friends of each friend. For each test case, if `n` is 2, it prints 2. If `n` is greater than 2 and there exists any friend `i` such that the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints 3. The function is designed to be called multiple times with different test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the number of friends `n`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1 (to match the 1-based indexing in the problem).

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`**:
   - If there are only 2 friends, the program directly prints `2` because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Checking for Cycles**:
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, which means that the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself. This indicates a cycle of length 3 or a self-loop (which is not possible given the problem constraints).
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints `2` and returns, as inviting any two friends in this cycle will ensure both come to the party.

5. **Default Case**:
   - If no such cycle is found, the program prints `3`.
   - The idea here is that if there are no cycles of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. This is because inviting 3 friends will always ensure at least 2 of them come, given the constraints of the problem.

### Analysis:
- **Cycle Detection**: The program correctly identifies cycles of length 3 by checking `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This is a valid approach because if such a cycle exists, inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure both come to the party.
- **Special Case for `n == 2`**: The program correctly handles the special case where there are only 2 friends.
- **Default Case**: The program correctly prints `3` if no cycle of length 3 is found. This is because in the absence of a cycle of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come is indeed 3.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
