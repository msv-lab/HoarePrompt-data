### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the number of friends `n`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1 (to match the 1-based indexing in the problem).

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`**:
   - If there are only 2 friends, the program directly prints `2` because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - This is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Checking for Cycles**:
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, which means that the best friend of the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself. This indicates a cycle of length 3.
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints `2` and returns, as inviting any two friends in this cycle will ensure both come to the party.
   - This is a valid approach for detecting cycles of length 3, but it does not handle all possible scenarios where fewer than 3 invitations are needed.

5. **Default Case**:
   - If no such cycle is found, the program prints `3`.
   - The idea here is that if there are no cycles of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. However, this is not always correct. For example, consider the case where there are two pairs of friends who are best friends with each other (e.g., `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`). In this case, inviting one friend from each pair (2 invitations) will ensure that both friends in each pair come to the party.

### Analysis:
- **Cycle Detection**: The program correctly identifies cycles of length 3 by checking `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. However, it fails to consider other possible scenarios where fewer than 3 invitations are needed.
- **Special Case for `n == 2`**: The program correctly handles the special case where there are only 2 friends.
- **Default Case**: The program's default case of printing `3` is not always correct. It assumes that if there are no cycles of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required is 3, but this is not necessarily true.

### Conclusion:
The program is not logically correct for all cases. It fails to handle scenarios where there are pairs of friends who are best friends with each other, which can be resolved with fewer than 3 invitations.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
