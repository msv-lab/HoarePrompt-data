You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers p of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should be called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000).
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n + 1`, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: *The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct). The function is called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000). `n` is an input integer, and `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the input integers, with an additional 0 at the beginning. If `n` is 2, the current value of `n` remains 2. If `n` is greater than 2, `i` is set to `n + 1`, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct). It processes the data related to the best friends of each friend and does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.

Case_3: The program does not return any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
