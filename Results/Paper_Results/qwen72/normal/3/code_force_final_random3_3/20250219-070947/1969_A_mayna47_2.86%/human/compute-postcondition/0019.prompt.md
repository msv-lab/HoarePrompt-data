Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should be called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000). `n` is now an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 2. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the input integers, with an additional 0 at the beginning.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
        print(2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. If `v[v[v[i]]]` is equal to `i`, the program returns nothing. Otherwise, the program does not modify any variables and continues execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. If `v[v[v[i]]]` is equal to `i`, the program does not return any value. Otherwise, the program does not modify any variables and continues execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
