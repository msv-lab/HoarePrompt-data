Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` (if it exists, otherwise `y` is `n + 1`), and `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y` after all iterations.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is the total number of test cases.
- The variable `_` is now `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times.
- The variable `inp` is a new list of integers read from the input for the last test case.
- The variable `a` is the last element of the list `inp` for the last test case.
- The variable `x` is the smallest element in the list `inp` for the last test case.
- The variable `y` is the second smallest element in the list `inp` for the last test case, or `n + 1` if there is no second smallest element.
- The variable `ans` is the number of elements in the list `inp` for the last test case that are greater than both `x` and `y` after all iterations of the inner loop have completed.
