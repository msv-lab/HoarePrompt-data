Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `_` is 1, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` (if it exists and is different from `x`), and `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to be the integer input provided by the user.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, which remains valid after the code execution.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `_`, `inp`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
