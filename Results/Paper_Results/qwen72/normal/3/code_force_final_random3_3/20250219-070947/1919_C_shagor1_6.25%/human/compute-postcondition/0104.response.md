Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `_` is 2 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
4. `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element.
5. `a` is the last element of `inp`.
6. `x` is the smallest element in `inp`.
7. `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` (if it exists, otherwise `y` is `n + 1`).
8. `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `inp`**: This list is populated with integers from the input. The list must have at least one element.
2. **Variable `a`**: This is the last element of the list `inp`.
3. **Variable `x`**: This is the smallest element in the list `inp`.
4. **Variable `y`**: This is the second smallest element in the list `inp`. If the list `inp` has only one element, then `y` is set to `n + 1`.
5. **Variable `ans`**: This is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- If `inp` has only one element, `x` will be that element, and `y` will be `n + 1`. Since `n + 1` is always greater than the single element in `inp`, no element in `inp` can be greater than both `x` and `y`. Therefore, `ans` will be 0.
- If `inp` has more than one element, `x` and `y` will be the smallest and second smallest elements, respectively. `ans` will count the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest element `x` and the second smallest element `y` (or `n + 1` if `y` does not exist).

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest element `x` and the second smallest element `y` (or `n + 1` if `y` does not exist))**
