Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `x` is the smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `y` is the smallest element in `inp` that is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `n + 1`, `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y` after all iterations.** 

The code `*inp, = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `inp`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` are defined based on the new list `inp` and the initial value of `n`.
