The code snippet `x == y` is a comparison operation that checks if `x` is equal to `y`. However, this comparison does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program. It only evaluates to a boolean value (True or False), which is not stored or used in this context.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to any variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `inp`, `ans` is 0 if the second element of `inp` ≤ `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1.**
