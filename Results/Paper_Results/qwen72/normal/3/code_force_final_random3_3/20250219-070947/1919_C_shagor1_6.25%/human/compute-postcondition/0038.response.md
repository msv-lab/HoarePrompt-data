Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 1, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input, `a` is undefined, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is undefined.**

The variables `x` and `y` are both assigned the value `n + 1`, where `n` is an input integer within the specified range. The other variables remain unchanged.
