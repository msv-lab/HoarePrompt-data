Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `_` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers from the input, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`.**

The values of `x` and `y` are both set to `n + 1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `inp`) remain unchanged.
