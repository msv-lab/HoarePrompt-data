Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` (if it exists, otherwise `y` is `n + 1`), and `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 2·10^5.
- The variable `_` remains 2.
- The variable `inp` is a list of integers from the input, and it must have at least one element.
- The variable `a` is the last element of the list `inp`.
- The variable `x` is the smallest element in the list `inp`.
- The variable `y` is the second smallest element in the list `inp` if such an element exists; otherwise, `y` remains `n + 1`.
- The variable `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.
