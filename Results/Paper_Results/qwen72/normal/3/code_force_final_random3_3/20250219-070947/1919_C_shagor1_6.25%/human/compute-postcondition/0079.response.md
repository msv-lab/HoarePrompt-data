Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `inp`, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `a` is greater than `x`, and `a` is less than or equal to `y`.**
