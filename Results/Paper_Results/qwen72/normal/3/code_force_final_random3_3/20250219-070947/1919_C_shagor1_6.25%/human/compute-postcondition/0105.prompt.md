Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    *inp, = map(int, input().split())
    x = y = n + 1
    ans = 0
    for a in inp:
        if a <= x:
            x = a
        elif a <= y:
            y = a
        else:
            x == y
            y = a
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `_` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` (if it exists and is different from `x`), and `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 1, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `x` is the smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to the initial `x` (which is `n + 1`), `y` is the smallest element in `inp` that is greater than `x` and less than or equal to the initial `y` (which is `n + 1`), `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y` after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the last element of `inp`, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp` (if it exists, otherwise `y` is `n + 1`), and `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
