The loop head only involves the variable `j` and the range it iterates over, which is fixed at `range(2)`. This means that the loop will execute a fixed number of times, specifically twice, regardless of the values of other variables. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since the loop iterates over `range(2)`, the next value of `j` will be 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the increment of `j` to 1, while the other variables (`cases`, `i`, `k`, `lex`, and `arr`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing the element 1. If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` and `arr` is a list containing the integer 26.**
