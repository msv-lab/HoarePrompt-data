Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing `[26]`, `j` is 0. If `lex` is between 0 and 26 (exclusive), `lex` remains an input integer within this range. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `lex` is updated to the input integer minus 26 and remains greater than or equal to 26.***
