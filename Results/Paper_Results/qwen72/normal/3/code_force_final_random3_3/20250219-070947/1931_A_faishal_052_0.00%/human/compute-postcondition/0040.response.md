The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and the range `3`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` being less than `3`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and it must still be less than `3`.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `k` is 1**
