The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range value `2`. Since the range is set to `2`, the loop will execute exactly 2 times regardless of the initial value of `j`. However, the initial value of `j` should be set to 0 for the loop to start correctly.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list**
