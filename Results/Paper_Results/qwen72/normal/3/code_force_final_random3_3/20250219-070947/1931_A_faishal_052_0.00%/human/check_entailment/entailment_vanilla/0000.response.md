Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that can be encoded to a given integer `n`. The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the encoded integer `lex`.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then iterates 2 times (for the first two letters of the word).
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should append the smallest possible value that can be subtracted from `lex` without making it negative.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it should append the largest possible value that can be subtracted from `lex` without making it negative.
   - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should append the largest possible value that can be subtracted from `lex` without making it negative.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

4. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The program sorts the list `arr` to ensure the smallest possible values are used first.
   - It then prints the corresponding characters by converting the positions to letters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.

5. **Issues**:
   - The logic for appending values to `arr` is flawed. It should always try to use the smallest possible values first to ensure the word is lexicographically smallest.
   - The program does not handle cases where `lex` is less than 52 correctly. It should always try to use the smallest possible value that can be subtracted from `lex` without making it negative.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should always try to use the smallest possible values for the first two letters and then use the remaining value for the third letter.
   - We can achieve this by:
     - Subtracting the smallest possible value (1) from `lex` for the first two letters.
     - The remaining value will be the position of the third letter.

7. **Revised Program**:
   ```python
   def func():
       cases = int(input())
       for i in range(cases):
           lex = int(input())
           arr = [1, 1, lex - 2]  # Start with the smallest possible values for the first two letters
           arr.sort()  # Ensure the list is sorted to get the lexicographically smallest word
           for k in range(3):
               print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')  # Convert positions to letters
           print()  # Move to the next line for the next test case
   ```

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The original program does not correctly handle the decoding logic to find the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The revised program correctly handles the decoding logic and ensures the word is lexicographically smallest.

Correctness: **False**
