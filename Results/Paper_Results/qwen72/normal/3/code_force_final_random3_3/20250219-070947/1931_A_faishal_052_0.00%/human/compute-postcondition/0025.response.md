Postcondition: ***`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 24, `arr` contains `[1, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 2. If `lex` is 25, `arr` contains `[26, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 27. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` contains `[1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 27. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 52.***
