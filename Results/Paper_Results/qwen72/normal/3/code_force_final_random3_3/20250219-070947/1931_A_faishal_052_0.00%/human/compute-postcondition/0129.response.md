Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `cases` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is 1.
- `lex` is an input integer.
- `arr` is defined based on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 27]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `arr[k]` based on the value of `lex`:**
   - `k` is 1, so we need to look at the second element of `arr`.

2. **Evaluate the different cases for `lex`:**
   - **If `lex` is less than or equal to 26:**
     - `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`.
     - `arr[k]` is `1`.
     - `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is `'a'`.

   - **If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52:**
     - `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`.
     - `arr[k]` is `26`.
     - `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is `'z'`.

   - **If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52:**
     - `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 27]`.
     - `arr[k]` is `26`.
     - `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is `'z'`.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `arr[k]` is always `26` regardless of the value of `lex` (as long as `lex` is greater than 26).
- Therefore, `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will always be `chr(122)`, which is `'z'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **z**
