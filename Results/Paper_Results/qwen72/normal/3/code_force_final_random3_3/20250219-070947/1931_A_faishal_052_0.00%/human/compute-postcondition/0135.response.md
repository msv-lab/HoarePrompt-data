Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `lex` (3 ≤ lex ≤ 78) from the input, which is the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters. The function then calculates and prints a string of three lowercase Latin letters whose positions sum up to `lex`. The letters are sorted in non-decreasing order of their positions. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the variables `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `lex` are in their final states as described in the annotations. **
