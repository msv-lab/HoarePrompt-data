The only object in the loop head is the variable `k`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and the range specified in the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `k` is 2**
