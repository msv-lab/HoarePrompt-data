Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, [1, 26, `lex`] if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, or [26, 26, `lex - 27`] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged. The variable `k` is incremented to 3, which is the number of iterations the loop has completed. The array `arr` also remains unchanged, as the loop only prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr` but does not modify the array itself.
