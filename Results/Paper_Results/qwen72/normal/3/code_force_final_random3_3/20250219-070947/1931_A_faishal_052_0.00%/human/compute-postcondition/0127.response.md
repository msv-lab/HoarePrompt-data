Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `cases` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is 0.
- `lex` is an input integer.
- `arr` is defined based on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is `[1, 26, lex]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 27]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `k`**: `k` is 0.
2. **Value of `arr[k]`**:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr[0]` is 1.
   - If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr[0]` is 1.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr[0]` is 26.

3. **Value of `chr(arr[k] + 96)`**:
   - `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is `'a'`.
   - `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is `'z'`.

### Conclusion:
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr[0]` is 1, and `chr(1 + 96)` is `'a'`.
- If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr[0]` is 1, and `chr(1 + 96)` is `'a'`.
- If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr[0]` is 26, and `chr(26 + 96)` is `'z'`.

Since `k` is 0, the value of `arr[k]` will be either 1 or 26 depending on the value of `lex`. Therefore, the `print` statement will output either `'a'` or `'z'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **'a' (if lex is less than or equal to 51) or 'z' (if lex is greater than or equal to 52)**
