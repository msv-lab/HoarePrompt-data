Output State: **`cases` is 0, `i` is `cases` - 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, [1, 26, `lex` - 26] if `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), or [26, 26, `lex` - 51] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `cases` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `i` is equal to `cases` - 1, meaning it has reached the last index of the loop.
- The variable `j` is 2, as it always completes the inner loop of 2 iterations.
- The variable `k` is 3, as it always completes the final loop of 3 iterations.
- The variable `lex` is an input integer, and the array `arr` is sorted in ascending order. The contents of `arr` depend on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains [1, 1, `lex`].
  - If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains [1, 26, `lex` - 26].
  - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 51].
