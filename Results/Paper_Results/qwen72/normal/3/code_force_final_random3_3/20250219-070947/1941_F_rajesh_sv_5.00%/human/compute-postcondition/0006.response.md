Output State: **`testcases` must be greater than 2, `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, `func_6()` has been called, and `func_6()` has returned.**

The code `func_6()` has already been executed and has returned, so calling it again does not change the state of the program. The initial conditions remain unchanged.
