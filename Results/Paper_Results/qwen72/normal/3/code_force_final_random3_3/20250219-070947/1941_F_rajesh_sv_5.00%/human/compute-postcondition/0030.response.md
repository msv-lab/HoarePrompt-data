Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` is the length of `A`, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the element which, together with the previous element, forms the largest difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`.**
