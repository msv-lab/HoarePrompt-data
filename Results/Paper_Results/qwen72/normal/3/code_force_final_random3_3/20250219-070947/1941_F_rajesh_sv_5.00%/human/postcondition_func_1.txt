The function `wrapper` takes no explicit parameters but uses the global variables `args` and `d`. It returns the value associated with `args` in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not already a key in `d`, the function calls `func` with the arguments in `args`, stores the result in `d` with `args` as the key, and then returns this result. The dictionary `d` is updated to include the result of `func` for the given `args` if it was not previously present.
