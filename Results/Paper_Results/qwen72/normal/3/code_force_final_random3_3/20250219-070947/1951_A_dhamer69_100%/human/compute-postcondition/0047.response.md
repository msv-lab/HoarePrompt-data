Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a new input string. If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1' characters, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.*** 

Note: Since the if and else parts do not specify any changes to the variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition, with the additional condition that `t` is decreased by 1.
