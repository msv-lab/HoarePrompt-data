Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string. If `n` is 2, the program executes the if part. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, or if `count_1` is 2 and the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11', the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part, where either the number of occurrences of the substring '11' in `s` is not equal to 1, or `count_1` is not equal to 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string. If `n` == 2, the conditions for the if part are met: if `s` == '00', no additional changes are made. Otherwise, no additional changes are made. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the conditions for the if part are met. If `s` contains exactly one '11' and `count_1` is 2, the conditions for the if part are also met. Otherwise, the conditions for the else part are met.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string. If `n` == 2, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `n` != 2 and `count_1` (the number of '1' characters in `s`) is odd, or if `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' and exactly two '1' characters, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
