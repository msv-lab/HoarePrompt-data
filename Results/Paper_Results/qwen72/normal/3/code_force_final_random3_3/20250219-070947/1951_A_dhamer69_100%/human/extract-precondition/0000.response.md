It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. The function described in the problem is `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)`, not `func()`. Let's correct this and extract the precondition based on the given problem description.

Problem description: The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is designed to find and process subfolders in the current directory whose names are numeric and fall within a specified range. For each qualifying subfolder, the function lists all `.html` files and generates two new files for each `.html` file: one with a `-ac.py` suffix and another with a `-wa.py` suffix.

Function definition:
```python
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end.**
