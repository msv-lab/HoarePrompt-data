Postcondition: ***`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is 2, `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together. If `x` is divisible by 2, `rev_res` is concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`. If `x` is not divisible by 2, `rev_res` is concatenated with the reversed value of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the second element in `rev_val`. `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string, and must have at least 2 elements.***
