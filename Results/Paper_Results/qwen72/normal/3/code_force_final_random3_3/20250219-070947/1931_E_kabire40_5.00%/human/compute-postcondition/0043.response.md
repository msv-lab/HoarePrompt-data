Postcondition: ***`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string and must have at least 2 elements, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, `x` is 2. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` plus the string representation of the integer value of the third element in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `val_in` is the third element of `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` concatenated with the reversed string of `val_in`.***
