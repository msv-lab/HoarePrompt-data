Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the last string in the `operational_list`, `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is 0. If `x` is divisible by 2, `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together, and `val_in` appended as a string. `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string, `val_in` is the integer value of the first element in `rev_val`. If `x` is not divisible by 2, `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together, plus the reversed value of `val_in`. `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string, `val_in` is the first element of `rev_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is 1, `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together. If `x` is divisible by 2, `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is now `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is not divisible by 2, `val_in` is the value of the second element in `rev_val`, and `rev_res` is now `rev_res` concatenated with the reversed value of `val_in`. `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string, and must have at least 1 element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is 2, `rev_res` is a string containing all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original string, concatenated together. If `x` is divisible by 2, `rev_res` is concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`. If `x` is not divisible by 2, `rev_res` is concatenated with the reversed value of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the second element in `rev_val`. `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all the strings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have a different length than the original string, and must have at least 2 elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
