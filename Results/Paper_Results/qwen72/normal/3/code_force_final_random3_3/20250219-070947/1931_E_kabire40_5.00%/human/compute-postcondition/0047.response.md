Postcondition: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the string representations of the integer values of the even-indexed elements in `rev_val` and the reversed strings of the odd-indexed elements in `rev_val`. `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input, and `x` is the length of `rev_val` minus 1. Additionally, `10 ** int(max_power)` is greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)`.**
