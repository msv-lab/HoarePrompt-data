Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x`, `rev_res` is either the first element in `operational_list` or an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is the first element in `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x` and `rev_res` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the second element in `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the second element in `operational_list`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of the previous `rev_res` and the second element in `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of the first element in `operational_list` and the reversed string of the second element in `operational_list`, and `rev_res` is either the first element in `operational_list` or an empty string. `list_len` and `max_power` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`, `list_len` and `max_power` remain unchanged. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the third element in `operational_list`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of the previous `rev_res` and the third element in `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of the first element in `operational_list` and the reversed string of the third element in `operational_list`, and `rev_res` is either the first element in `operational_list` or an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
