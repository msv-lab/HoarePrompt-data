Output State: **`y` is 1, `x` is the second element in `operational_list`, `operational_list` must have at least 2 strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_res` remains an empty string.** 

The code snippet appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. Since the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`, `rev_val` now contains the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_res` remains an empty string. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
