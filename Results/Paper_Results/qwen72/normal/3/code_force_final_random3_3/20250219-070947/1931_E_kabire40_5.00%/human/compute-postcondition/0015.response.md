Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the first element in `operational_list` and the reversed string of the second element in `operational_list`, `rev_res` is either the first element in `operational_list` or an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input that must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the second element in `operational_list`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the second element in `operational_list`, then `rev_res` is the second element in `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of the second element in `operational_list` and `rev_res` is an empty string.**
