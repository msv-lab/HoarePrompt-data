Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not simulate the turns and the optimal play strategy for both players. Instead, it reverses the digits of the numbers and concatenates them in a specific order, which does not follow the rules of the game.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output "Anna" because it does not correctly simulate the game. According to the problem statement, Anna can reverse the number 2 to 2, and then Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than 10^2 = 100. Therefore, Sasha wins. However, the program does not follow this logic and instead concatenates the numbers in a way that does not reflect the game's rules.
