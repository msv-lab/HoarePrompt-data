Output State: **`y` is 1, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `x` is the first element in `operational_list`, `operational_list` must have at least 1 string, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`.**

Explanation:
- `x_rev` is assigned the value of the reversed string `x`, converted to an integer.
- The values of `y`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, `x`, `operational_list`, `list_len`, and `max_power` remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions are still valid, with the addition of the new variable `x_rev`.
