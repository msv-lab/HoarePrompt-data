Postcondition: ***`y` is 1, `x` is the third element in `operational_list`, `operational_list` must have at least 3 strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. If the length of `x_rev` as a string is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is set to the string `x` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` remains an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.***
