Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x` is -1. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, the condition is false and the integer value of `rev_res` is less than or equal to 10 raised to the power of the integer value of `max_power`.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least one string, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the first string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the first string in the `operational_list` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least two strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the second string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the second string in the `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string, and the reversed string of `x` is appended to `rev_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is 2, `operational_list` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least three strings, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x` is the third string in the `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the third string in the `operational_list` concatenated with itself. Otherwise, `rev_res` is an empty string, and the reversed string of `x` is appended to `rev_val` again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
