Output State: **`y` is 1, `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`, `rev_res` is an empty string, `x` is the first element in `operational_list`, `operational_list` must have at least 1 string, `list_len` and `max_power` are now assigned the values from the input split by a space, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`.
- `rev_val` was initially an empty list, and now it contains the reversed string of `x`.
- The other variables (`y`, `rev_res`, `x`, `operational_list`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `x_rev`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
