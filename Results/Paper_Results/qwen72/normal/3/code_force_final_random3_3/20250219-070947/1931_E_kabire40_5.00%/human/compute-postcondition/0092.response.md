Output State: **`y` is 1, `operational_list` has the same number of strings as the initial input, `list_len` and `max_power` are assigned the values from the input split by a space, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string, followed by the string representation of the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`, and then followed by the reversed string representation of the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`, `val_in` is the integer value of the second element in `rev_val`, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is 2.**

Explanation:
- `rev_res` is updated by appending the reversed string representation of `val_in` to it.
- All other variables (`y`, `operational_list`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `val_in`, `rev_val`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `rev_res` includes the original content plus the reversed string of `val_in`.
