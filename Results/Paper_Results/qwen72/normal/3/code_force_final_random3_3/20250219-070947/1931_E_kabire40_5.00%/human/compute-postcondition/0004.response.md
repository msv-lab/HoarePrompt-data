The code snippet `operational_list = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `operational_list`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings based on the input.**
