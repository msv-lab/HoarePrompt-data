The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for `i` to be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `nodes[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element, and `nodes[v]` has one more element `u` appended to it.**
