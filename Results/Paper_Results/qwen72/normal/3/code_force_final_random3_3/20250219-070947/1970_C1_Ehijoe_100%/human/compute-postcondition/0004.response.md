The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. Given that `n` is already an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, this condition is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n`.

However, `i` needs to be initialized to 0 for the loop to start correctly. The other variables (`t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `i` is 0**
