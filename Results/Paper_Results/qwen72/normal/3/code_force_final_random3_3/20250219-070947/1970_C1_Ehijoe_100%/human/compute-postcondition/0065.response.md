Postcondition: ***The loop has completed all iterations, and the `tree` list now contains a sequence of nodes starting from the first element of `ends` (`s`) and ending at the second element of `ends` (`e`). The `prev` variable is set to the last node added to `tree` before the loop terminated, and `curr` is set to `e`. The values of `n`, `i`, `nodes`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged, and `ends` still contains all keys from `nodes` that have a list of length 1. `start` is assigned the value of an input integer. `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list. `moves` is a list containing two elements: `idx` and `n - idx - 1`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is an odd number, the program follows the if part. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even, and the program follows the else part.***
