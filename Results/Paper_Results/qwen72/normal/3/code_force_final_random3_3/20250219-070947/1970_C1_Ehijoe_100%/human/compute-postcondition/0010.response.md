Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `i` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes[u]` now contains `v` as an additional element, `nodes[v]` now contains `u` as an additional element, and `nodes[u]` has one more element `v` appended to it.**

In natural language: The initial state remains mostly unchanged, but the list `nodes[u]` now has an additional element `v` appended to it. The other variables and conditions remain the same.
