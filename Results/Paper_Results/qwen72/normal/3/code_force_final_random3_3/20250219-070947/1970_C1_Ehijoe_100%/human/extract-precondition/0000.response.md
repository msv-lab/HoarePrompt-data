Precondition: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the function should be called with specific inputs that are not directly passed as arguments. The inputs are expected to be provided in a predefined format: the first line contains two integers n and t, where n represents the number of nodes in the tree (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) and t is always 1. The next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree. The last line contains a single integer u (1 ≤ u ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round.**
