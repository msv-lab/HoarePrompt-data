Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least three keys, `key` is the third key in `nodes`, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `ends` is a list containing the third key in `nodes`.**

Explanation: The code `ends.append(key)` adds the third key in `nodes` to the list `ends`. Since the initial state specifies that if `len(nodes[key]) == 1`, `ends` is a list containing the third key in `nodes`, and otherwise `ends` remains an empty list, after appending `key`, `ends` will definitely contain the third key in `nodes`. All other variables remain unchanged.
