Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and must have at least one key, `key` is the first key in `nodes`, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `ends` is a list containing the first key in `nodes`.** 

The code appends the first key in `nodes` to the list `ends`, which was initially empty. The other variables remain unchanged.
