#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input arguments, but the provided function definition does not include any parameters. For the problem to be correctly addressed, the function should accept parameters such as the number of test cases `t`, the size of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `a`.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not perform any actions. It simply returns `None` without modifying any input variables or the program state.
