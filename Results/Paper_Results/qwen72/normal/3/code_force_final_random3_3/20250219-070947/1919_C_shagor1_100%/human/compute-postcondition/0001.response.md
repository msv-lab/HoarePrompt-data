Functionality: **The function is intended to accept parameters such as the number of test cases `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains the size of an array `n` and the array `a` itself. However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters, and thus it does not return any value or perform any operation based on the input.**
