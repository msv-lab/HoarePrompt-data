You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input arguments, but the provided function definition does not include any parameters. For the problem to be correctly addressed, the function should accept parameters such as the number of test cases `t`, the size of the array `n`, and the array `a` itself. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `a`.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept parameters such as the number of test cases `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains the size of an array `n` and the array `a` itself. However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters, and thus it does not return any value or perform any operation based on the input.

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
