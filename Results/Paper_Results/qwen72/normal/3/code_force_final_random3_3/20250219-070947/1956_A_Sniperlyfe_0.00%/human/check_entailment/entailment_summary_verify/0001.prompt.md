You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `k` and `q` from the user input, followed by a list `p` of `k` positive integers and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers. It then processes each element `n` in `qs` by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. After processing all elements in `qs`, it prints the results of `res` for that test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and the results for each test case have been printed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function takes two parameters: `n` (the number of players) and `p` (the list of positions to be removed).
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - Inside the loop, it reduces `n` by the number of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. This is done using a generator expression `(1 for x in p if x <= n)` which counts the number of valid positions to remove.
   - Once the loop exits, it returns the remaining number of players, which is the number of winners.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, where `k` is the length of the sequence `p` and `q` is the number of different initial player counts to consider.
   - It then reads the sequence `p` and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results.
   - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for the current test case.

### Issues:
- **Output Timing:**
  - The `print` statement inside the loop that processes each initial player count `n` is incorrect. It should be outside the loop, after all results for the current test case have been computed.
  - The current placement of the `print` statement will print partial results for each `n` in `qs`, which is not the desired behavior.

### Corrected Function 2:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Conclusion:
- The logic of `func_1` is correct and handles the problem as described.
- The logic of `func_2` is mostly correct, but the placement of the `print` statement is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program needs the `print` statement to be moved outside the inner loop to correctly print the results for each test case.
