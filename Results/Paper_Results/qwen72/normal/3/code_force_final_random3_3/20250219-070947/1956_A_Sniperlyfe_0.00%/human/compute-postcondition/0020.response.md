Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is an empty list.** 

The code snippet initializes `res` as an empty list, which means that the list `res` now contains no elements. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
