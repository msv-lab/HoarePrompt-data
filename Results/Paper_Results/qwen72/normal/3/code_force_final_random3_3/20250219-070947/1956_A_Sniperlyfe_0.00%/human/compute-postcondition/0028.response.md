Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is the third element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`.
- The initial state specifies that `res` already contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- After executing the code, `res` will contain two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
