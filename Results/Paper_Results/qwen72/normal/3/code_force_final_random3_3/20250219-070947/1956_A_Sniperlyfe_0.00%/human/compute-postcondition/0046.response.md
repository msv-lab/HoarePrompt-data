Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is `t` (the total number of iterations), `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the last element in `qs` for the last iteration, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` is now 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
- The variable `_` has reached the total number of iterations, which is the value of `t` at the start.
- The variables `k` and `q` hold the input integers provided for the last iteration.
- The list `p` contains the integers provided by the user for the last iteration, with the same properties as the initial state.
- The list `qs` contains the integers provided by the user for the last iteration, with the same properties as the initial state.
- The variable `n` is the last element in `qs` from the last iteration.
- The list `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` for each iteration of the loop, in the order they were processed.
