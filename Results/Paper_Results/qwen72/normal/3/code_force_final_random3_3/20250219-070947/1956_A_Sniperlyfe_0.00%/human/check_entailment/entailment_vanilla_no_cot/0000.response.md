Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical issue in the `func_2` function. Specifically, the `print` statement is inside the loop that iterates over each `n` in `qs`, which means it will print the result after processing each `n` individually, rather than printing all results at once after processing all `n` values. This will result in incorrect output formatting.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
# Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

In this corrected version, the `print` statement is moved outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`, ensuring that all results are printed together for each test case. This aligns with the expected output format.
