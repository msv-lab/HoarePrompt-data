To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `k` and `q` are input integers.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements.
   - `n` is the third element in `qs`.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `n` is the third element in the list `qs`. Since `qs` must have at least 3 elements, `n` is a known integer.
   - `func_1(n, p)` is a function that takes two arguments: `n` (an integer) and `p` (a list of integers). The exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we can only describe its output based on the given information.
   - `res` is a list that initially contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`. After that, the result of `func_1(n, p)` is appended to `res` again. Therefore, `res` will contain two identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement converts each element in `res` to a string using `map(str, res)`.
   - The `join` method then concatenates these string elements with a space as the separator.
   - Since `res` contains two identical elements, the output will be the string representation of the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice, separated by a space.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the result of `func_1(n, p)` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] (where n is the third element in the list qs and p is the list of integers provided by the user)**
