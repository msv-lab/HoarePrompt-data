Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 1.
2. `_` is 2.
3. `k` and `q` are input integers.
4. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements.
6. `n` is the third element in `qs`.
7. `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`n` is the third element in `qs`**:
   - Since `qs` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `n` will be the integer at index 2 of `qs`.

2. **`res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it**:
   - `func_1(n, p)` is called twice, and the results are stored in the list `res`.
   - Therefore, `res` will contain two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **`print(' '.join(map(str, res)))`**:
   - The `map(str, res)` function converts each element in the list `res` to a string.
   - The `' '.join(...)` function joins these string elements with a space in between them.
   - The `print` function then outputs this joined string.

### Final Output:
Since `res` contains two identical elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the output will be the string representation of these two elements separated by a space.

Output: **result_of_func_1(n, p) result_of_func_1(n, p)** (where `result_of_func_1(n, p)` is the result of the function `func_1` when called with `n` as the third element of `qs` and `p` as the user-provided list of integers)
