Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 250. k and q are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100. p is a list of k positive integers where 1 <= p[i] <= 100 and p[i] < p[i+1] for all 0 <= i < k-1. qs is a list of q positive integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q.**
