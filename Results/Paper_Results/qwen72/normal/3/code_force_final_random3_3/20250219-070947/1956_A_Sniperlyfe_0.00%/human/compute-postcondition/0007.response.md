Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `n` is the first element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of the function `func_1` called with `n` and `p` to the list `res`.
- `n` is the first element in `qs`.
- `res` was initially an empty list, and now it contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`) remain unchanged.
