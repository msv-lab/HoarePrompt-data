### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - The function is designed to simulate the process of kicking out players from the game until no more players can be kicked out.
   - The loop `while n >= min(p):` continues as long as there are players that can be kicked out based on the sequence `p`.
   - Inside the loop, `n -= sum(1 for x in p if x <= n)` calculates the number of players to be kicked out in the current round and reduces `n` by that amount.
   - The loop terminates when `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`, meaning no more players can be kicked out.
   - The function returns the number of players remaining, which is `n`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of queries `qs`.
   - It initializes an empty list `res` to store the results for each query.
   - For each query `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
   - However, the function prints the results inside the loop for each query, which means it prints the list `res` after each append. This is incorrect because it should print the results once all queries have been processed.

3. **Output Issues**:
   - The program should print the results for all queries in `qs` for each test case only once, after all queries have been processed.
   - The current implementation prints the results after each query, which will produce incorrect and redundant output.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it prints the results prematurely inside the loop for each query, leading to incorrect and redundant output. The correct implementation should print the results for all queries in `qs` only once, after all queries have been processed.
