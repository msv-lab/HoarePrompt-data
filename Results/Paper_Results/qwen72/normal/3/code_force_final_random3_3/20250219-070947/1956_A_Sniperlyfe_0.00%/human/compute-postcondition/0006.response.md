The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `n` will take the value of the first element in `qs` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `n` is the first element in `qs`, `res` is an empty list**
