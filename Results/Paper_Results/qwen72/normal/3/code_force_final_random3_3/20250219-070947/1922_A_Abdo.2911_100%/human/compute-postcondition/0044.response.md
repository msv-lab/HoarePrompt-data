Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are user inputs with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`. If there exists at least one character in `a` that is equal to the corresponding character in `b` and the corresponding character in `c` is different, or if there exists at least one character in `a` that is not equal to the corresponding character in `b` and the corresponding character in `c` is not equal to either `a` or `b`, then `possible` is set to True. Otherwise, `possible` remains False.**
