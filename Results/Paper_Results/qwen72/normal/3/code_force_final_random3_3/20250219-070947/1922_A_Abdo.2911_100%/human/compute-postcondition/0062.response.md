Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 0, `possible` is True, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `b`. Additionally, the first element of `c` is not equal to the first element of `a` and the first element of `c` is not equal to the first element of `b`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
