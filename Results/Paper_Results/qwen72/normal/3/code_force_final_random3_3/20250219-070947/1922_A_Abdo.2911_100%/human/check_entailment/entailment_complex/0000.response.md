Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and verify if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Conditions**:
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False`.
   - It iterates through each character index `i` from 0 to `n-1` to check the conditions for a valid template:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`:
       - The template requires that the corresponding character in `c` must be different from `a[i]` (and `b[i]` since they are the same).
       - If this condition is met, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`:
       - The template requires that the corresponding character in `c` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
       - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next index.
       - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `possible` remains `False`, it prints 'NO'.

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `1`, `1`, `a`, `b`, `c`
  - `a[0] == b[0]` (both are 'a' and 'b' respectively, so they are different).
  - `c[0] != a[0]` (c[0] is 'c', which is different from 'a').
  - The function should print 'YES', which is correct.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `2`, `2`, `aa`, `bb`, `aa`
  - `a[0] == b[0]` (both are 'a' and 'b' respectively, so they are different).
  - `c[0] == a[0]` (c[0] is 'a', which is the same as 'a').
  - `a[1] == b[1]` (both are 'a' and 'b' respectively, so they are different).
  - `c[1] == a[1]` (c[1] is 'a', which is the same as 'a').
  - The function should print 'NO', which is correct.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `10`, `mathforces`, `luckforces`, `adhoccoder`
  - `a[0] != b[0]` (a[0] is 'm' and b[0] is 'l').
  - `c[0] != a[0]` and `c[0] != b[0]` (c[0] is 'a', which is different from 'm' and 'l').
  - The function should print 'YES', which is correct.

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `3`, `acc`, `abd`, `abc`
  - `a[0] != b[0]` (a[0] is 'a' and b[0] is 'a').
  - `c[0] == a[0]` (c[0] is 'a', which is the same as 'a').
  - `a[1] != b[1]` (a[1] is 'c' and b[1] is 'b').
  - `c[1] == a[1]` (c[1] is 'b', which is the same as 'b').
  - `a[2] != b[2]` (a[2] is 'c' and b[2] is 'd').
  - `c[2] == a[2]` (c[2] is 'c', which is the same as 'c').
  - The function should print 'NO', which is correct.

Based on the above reasoning, the function correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not.

Correctness: **True**
