### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False`.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, then `a` and `b` match the template at this position, and `c` does not. This makes the template possible, so `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.
     - If `a[i]` is different from `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template at this position, which is not allowed. The loop continues to the next position.
     - If `a[i]` is different from `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `a` and `b` can match the template at this position, and `c` does not. This makes the template possible, so `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES".
   - If `possible` is `False`, the function prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic correctly checks if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not.
- The conditions for setting `possible` to `True` are:
  - `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]` (both `a` and `b` match the template, and `c` does not).
  - `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i] != b[i]` (both `a` and `b` can match the template, and `c` does not).
- The conditions for setting `possible` to `False` are:
  - `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] == a[i]` or `c[i] == b[i]` (at least one character in `c` matches the template, which is not allowed).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a template `t` exists such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. The conditions and the flow of the program are consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
