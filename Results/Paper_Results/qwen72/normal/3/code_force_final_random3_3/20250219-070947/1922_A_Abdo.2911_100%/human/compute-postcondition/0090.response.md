Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is True/False (unchanged)**

The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer. The other variables remain unchanged, except that their initial values are still valid, and `n` is now the new input integer. The state of `possible` remains the same as it was initially (True or False).
