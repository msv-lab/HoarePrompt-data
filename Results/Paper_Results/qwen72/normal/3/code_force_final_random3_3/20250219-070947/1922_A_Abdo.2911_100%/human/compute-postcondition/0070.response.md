Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is 1, `possible` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `possible` to `True`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the first characters of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this assignment, so they remain as stated in the initial state.
