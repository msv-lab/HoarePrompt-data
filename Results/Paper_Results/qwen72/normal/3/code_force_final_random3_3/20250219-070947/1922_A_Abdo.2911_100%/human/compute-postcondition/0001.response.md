The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts, as it will be assigned by the `range(t)` function. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
