Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t-1`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is set by the loop. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is unchanged if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] == a[i]` or `c[i] == b[i]`, the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
