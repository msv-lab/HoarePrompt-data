Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `b` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `c` is the new user input with leading and trailing spaces removed, `i` is `n-1`, `possible` is False.** 

The code snippet sets the variable `possible` to `False`, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain as they were initially, and `possible` is now explicitly `False`.
