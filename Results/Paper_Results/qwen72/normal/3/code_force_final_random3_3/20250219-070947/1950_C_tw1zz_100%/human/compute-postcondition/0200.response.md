Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the hour part of the input string `s`.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.
   - `h1` is the hour part in 12-hour format.
   - `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.

2. **Conditions for `h1` and `time`:**
   - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is between '13' and '23', `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print` statement will concatenate `h1`, `':', `m`, `' ', `time` without any separators.
   - The value of `h1` and `time` will depend on the value of `h` as per the conditions provided.

Let's consider a few examples to illustrate the output:

- **If `s` is "01:30":**
  - `h` is '01'.
  - `m` is '30'.
  - According to the conditions, `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - Output: **01:30 AM**

- **If `s` is "12:45":**
  - `h` is '12'.
  - `m` is '45'.
  - According to the conditions, `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
  - Output: **12:45 PM**

- **If `s` is "15:15":**
  - `h` is '15'.
  - `m` is '15'.
  - According to the conditions, `h1` is '03' (15 - 12) and `time` is 'PM'.
  - Output: **03:15 PM**

- **If `s` is "00:00":**
  - `h` is '00'.
  - `m` is '00'.
  - According to the conditions, `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - Output: **12:00 AM**

- **If `s` is "24:00" (which is not a valid input as per the format "hh:mm"):**
  - `h` is '24'.
  - `m` is '00'.
  - According to the conditions, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.
  - Output: **:00**

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **[h1]:[m] [time] (where [h1] is the hour part in 12-hour format and [time] is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h` as described in the conditions)**
