Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string provided by the user, `m` is the minute part of the input string provided by the user, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h1` is an empty string, `time` is an empty string.**

The code snippet `time = ''` does not change the value of `time` from its initial state, as it was already an empty string. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
