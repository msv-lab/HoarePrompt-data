Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the correct handling of the AM/PM designation and the special cases for "00" and "12". The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map each 24-hour hour to its corresponding 12-hour format, and it maintains the leading zeros for hours and minutes as required. The output format is also correct, with the time and AM/PM designation separated by a space. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
