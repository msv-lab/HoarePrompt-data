Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the hour part of the input string `s`.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the print statement).

2. **Conditions for `h1` and `time`:**
   - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', `h1` is `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', `h1` is the corresponding 12-hour format hour and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is not one of the specified values, `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - The print statement concatenates `h1`, `:`, `m`, a space, and `time` without any separators.
   - The value of `h1` and `time` depends on the value of `h` as described in the conditions.
   - The value of `m` is the minute part of the input string `s`.

Let's consider the possible values of `h` and their corresponding `h1` and `time`:

- If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '04', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '05', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '06', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '07', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '08', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '09', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '10', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '11', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '13', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '14', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '15', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '16', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '17', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '18', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '19', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '20', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '21', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '22', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '23', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is not one of the specified values, `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **[h1]:[m] [time] (where [h1] is the 12-hour format hour corresponding to the hour part of the input string `s`, [m] is the minute part of the input string `s`, and [time] is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions provided)**

For example:
- If `s` is '01:30', the output will be **01:30 AM**.
- If `s` is '13:45', the output will be **01:45 PM**.
- If `s` is '00:00', the output will be **12:00 AM**.
