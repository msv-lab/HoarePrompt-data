Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the hour part of the input string provided by the user, `m` is the minute part of the input string provided by the user, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h1` is the hour part in 12-hour format, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is between '13' and '23', `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string. The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, and the integer value provided by the user must be greater than the current value of the loop counter.**

Explanation: The code snippet `h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))` updates the values of `h` and `m` based on user input. The input is expected to be in the format "hh:mm", where `h` is the hour part and `m` is the minute part. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
