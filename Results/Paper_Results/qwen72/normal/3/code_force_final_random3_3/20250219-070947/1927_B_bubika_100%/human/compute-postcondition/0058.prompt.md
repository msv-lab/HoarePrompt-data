Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, a is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `b` is a list of 26 zeros with the elements at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the string containing the characters from the string `a` at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` concatenated in the order they appear in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `b` is a list where the elements at the indices corresponding to the values in `s` are incremented by the number of times those values appear in `s`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is a string containing the characters from `a` at the indices corresponding to the values in `s`, concatenated in the order of the elements in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 2, `b` is a list of 26 zeros with `b[i]` incremented by the number of times each corresponding integer `i` appears in the list `s`, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `a` at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
