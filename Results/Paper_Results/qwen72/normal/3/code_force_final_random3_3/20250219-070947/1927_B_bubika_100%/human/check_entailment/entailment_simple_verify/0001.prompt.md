You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    for t in range(int(input())):

        n = int(input())

    #State: `t` is 0, `b` is a list of 26 zeros with the elements at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s` incremented by the number of times those values appear in `s` across all iterations, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user, `r` is a string containing the characters from the string `a` at the indices corresponding to the integers in `s`, concatenated in the order they appear in `s` for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `s`.

2. **Trace Array Processing:**
   - The program initializes a list `b` of 26 zeros, which will keep track of the number of occurrences of each letter in the alphabet.
   - It then iterates over the trace array `s` and for each element `i` in `s`, it finds the index `x` of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`.
   - The program appends the corresponding letter from the alphabet string `a` to the result string `r`.
   - It increments the count of the letter at index `x` in `b`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing the trace array for each test case, the program prints the constructed string `r`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Trace Array Processing:**
  - The trace array `s` is constructed such that `s[i]` is the number of previous occurrences of the character at position `i` in the string.
  - The program uses the list `b` to keep track of the number of occurrences of each character. This is a valid approach because the alphabet has 26 letters, and the trace values are guaranteed to be less than `n`.
  - The `b.index(i)` operation finds the first index in `b` where the value is `i`, which corresponds to the next available character in the alphabet that has occurred `i` times so far.
  - The program correctly appends the character to the result string `r` and updates the count in `b`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 by correctly outputting a single character string.
  - The program also handles the case where all trace values are 0, which means the string consists of all different characters or all the same character.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient enough for the given constraints. The `b.index(i)` operation is O(26) in the worst case, which is constant time. The overall complexity is O(n) per test case, which is acceptable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a string from the given trace array for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
