Output State: **`t` is 2, `b` is a list of 26 zeros with `b[i]` incremented by 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `r` is the string `r` concatenated with the character at index `x` in the string `a`.**

Explanation: The code `r += a[x]` concatenates the character at index `x` in the string `a` to the string `r`. The values of `t`, `b`, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The updated value of `r` is the original string `r` plus the character at index `x` in `a`.
