### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to perform a series of operations on an array `a` and construct a set `S` by inserting `a[i] + i` into `S` and then deleting `a[i]` from `a`.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty, and we need to construct a new array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.
   - The goal is to find the lexicographically largest `b`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`:
     - It reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
     - It modifies each element of `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]`.
     - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element.
     - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
     - It initializes `cnt` to the number of duplicates in `a` and `cur` to 0.
     - It constructs the array `ans` by:
       - Adding elements from `a` in descending order.
       - If there are duplicates, it adds the largest possible unique elements between the current and previous elements.
     - Finally, it prints the array `ans`.

3. **Step-by-Step Verification:**
   - **Modification of `a`:**
     - `a[i] += i + 1` correctly modifies each element as required.
   - **Counting Duplicates:**
     - `Counter(a)` correctly counts the occurrences of each element.
   - **Removing Duplicates and Sorting:**
     - `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicates and `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the array in descending order.
   - **Constructing `ans`:**
     - The loop iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a`.
     - It adds the largest possible unique elements between the current and previous elements to handle duplicates.
     - It ensures that the final array `ans` is the lexicographically largest possible.
   - **Handling Remaining Duplicates:**
     - After the loop, it adds the remaining unique elements to `ans` to ensure the array is of the correct length.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.
   - It also handles the case where there are no duplicates in `a`.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly follows the steps to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` by ensuring that the elements are added in the correct order and handling duplicates appropriately.
   - The logic for adding the largest possible unique elements between the current and previous elements is sound and ensures that the array `ans` is the lexicographically largest possible.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program correctly solves the problem as described.

Final: **True**
