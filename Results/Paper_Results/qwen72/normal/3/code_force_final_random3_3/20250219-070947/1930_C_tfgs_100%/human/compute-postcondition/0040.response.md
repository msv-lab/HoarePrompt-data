The value of `cnt` is decremented by `adv`. The initial state specifies that `adv` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `adv - 1`. The `ans` list has `adv` new elements appended, which are equal to `a[i - 1] - 1` to `a[i - 1] - adv`. Since `adv` is greater than 0, `cnt` will be reduced by a positive value.

Output State: **`adv` must be greater than 0, `j` is `adv - 1`, `ans` has `adv` new elements appended which are equal to `a[i - 1] - 1` to `a[i - 1] - adv`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv`.**
