Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur` is 0 or `cur - adv`, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a` or the difference between `n` and the length of `a` minus `adv`, `ans` is a list containing the value `a[i]` or the values `a[i - 1] - 1` to `a[i - 1] - adv` and `a[i]`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than 0, `j` is `adv - 1`.**
