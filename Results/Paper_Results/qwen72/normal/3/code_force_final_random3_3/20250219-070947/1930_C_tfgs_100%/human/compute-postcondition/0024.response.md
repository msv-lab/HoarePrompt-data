Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is greater than 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1` to `a[i - 1] - adv`, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` and must be greater than 0, `j` is `adv - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The value of `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5.
- The list `a` remains a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, with each integer originally in the range 1 to 10^9 and incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n.
- The variable `i` remains greater than 0.
- The `counter` object still counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`.
- The variable `cur` remains 0.
- The variable `cnt` remains the difference between `n` and the length of `a`, and it must be greater than 0.
- The list `ans` now contains the values from `a[i - 1] - 1` to `a[i - 1] - adv`, where `adv` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
- The variable `adv` remains the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and it must be greater than 0.
- The loop variable `j` is `adv - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
