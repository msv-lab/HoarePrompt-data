Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` remains the same, `adv` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` now includes the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for all 0 ≤ j < `adv` at the end of the list.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 after the loop completes.
- The length of the list `a` remains the same.
- The variable `adv` is now 0 or greater, depending on the initial value of `adv` and how many iterations the loop performed.
- The list `ans` now contains the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `adv - 1`. These values are appended to `ans` in the order they are generated by the loop.
