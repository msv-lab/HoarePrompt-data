Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` remains the same, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` now includes the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` at the end of the list.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`.
- The value of `i` is `i + 1`, so `i - 1` refers to the previous value of `i`.
- The value of `a[i - 1]` is the element at the index `i - 1` in the list `a`.
- The value of `j` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a known value in the context of the code.
- The list `ans` is updated to include the new value at the end.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
