The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `adv`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was at some value within the range of `adv`, and `adv` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `adv` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` remains the same, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` now includes the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` at the end of the list, `j` is `j + 1` and `adv` must be greater than `j`**
