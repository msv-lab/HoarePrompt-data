Output State: **`i` is equal to the user-provided number of iterations (an integer between 2 and 1000), `x` is the last input integer provided (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and `y` is equal to `x // 2`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the number of times the user specified the loop should run. The variable `x` will hold the last integer value provided by the user, which is within the range of 2 to 1000. The variable `y` will hold the result of `x // 2`, which is the integer division of `x` by 2.
