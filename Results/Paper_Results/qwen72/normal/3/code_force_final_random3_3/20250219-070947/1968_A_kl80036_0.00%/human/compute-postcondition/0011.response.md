Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `y` is equal to `x` // 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(y)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `x` is an integer that is greater than 2.
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `x` // 2, which means `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2. This will result in the largest integer less than or equal to the division of `x` by 2.
   - The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y`.

Since `x` is greater than 2, the value of `y` will be the integer part of `x` divided by 2. For example:
- If `x` is 3, then `y` will be 1.
- If `x` is 4, then `y` will be 2.
- If `x` is 5, then `y` will be 2.
- If `x` is 6, then `y` will be 3.

Therefore, the output will be the integer part of `x` divided by 2.

Output: **y (where y is the integer part of x divided by 2, and x is an input integer greater than 2)**
