### Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether it satisfies the problem description for all valid inputs.

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We are given an integer \( x \) and need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of \( x \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) (integer division of \( x \) by 2).
   - Finally, it prints \( y \).

3. **GCD Analysis**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is a value that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.
   - For \( y = x // 2 \):
     - If \( x \) is even, \( y = x // 2 \) and \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), so \( \gcd(x, y) + y = y + y = 2y \).
     - If \( x \) is odd, \( y = x // 2 \) and \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + y \).

4. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**:
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) gives \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 2y \), which is the maximum possible value for \( y \) in this case.
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) gives \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + y \). However, this is not always the optimal choice. For example, if \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \) gives \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \), but \( y = 6 \) gives \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \), which is greater.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 5 \) (even case): \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \). This is correct.
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \) (odd case): \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \). This is incorrect; the correct \( y \) should be 6, giving \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 10 \) (odd case): \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 \). This is incorrect; the correct \( y \) should be 14, giving \( \gcd(21, 14) + 14 = 7 + 14 = 21 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 50 \) (even case): \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \). This is correct.
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \) (odd case): \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \). This is correct.
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 500 \) (even case): \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \). This is correct.
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 3 \) (even case): \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \). This is correct.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) for even \( x \).
   - However, for odd \( x \), the program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for odd values of \( x \). Specifically, it fails to consider other potential values of \( y \) that could yield a higher result.
