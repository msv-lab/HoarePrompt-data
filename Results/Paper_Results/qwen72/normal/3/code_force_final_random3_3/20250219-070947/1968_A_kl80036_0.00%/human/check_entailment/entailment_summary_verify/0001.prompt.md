You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

    1000
    
    6

Output

    18
    98
    1
    750

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer from the user, which represents the number of iterations to perform. For each iteration, it reads another integer `x` (where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and calculates `y` as `x // 2`. It then prints `y` for each iteration. After the function concludes, the number of iterations `i` is equal to the user-provided number of iterations, `x` is the last input integer provided (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and `y` is equal to `x // 2` for the last iteration. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether it satisfies the problem description for all valid inputs.

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We are given an integer \( x \) and need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of \( x \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) (integer division of \( x \) by 2).
   - Finally, it prints \( y \).

3. **GCD Analysis**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is a value that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.
   - For \( y = x // 2 \), the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) is \( x // 2 \) if \( x \) is even, and 1 if \( x \) is odd.
   - If \( x \) is even, \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), so \( \gcd(x, y) + y = y + y = 2y \).
   - If \( x \) is odd, \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + y \).

4. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**:
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) gives \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 2y \), which is the maximum possible value for \( y \) in this case.
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) gives \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + y \). The next best candidate would be \( y = x // 2 - 1 \), but \( y = x // 2 \) is already the largest possible \( y \) that is less than \( x \).

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 5 \) (even case): \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \) (odd case): \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 10 \) (odd case): \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 50 \) (even case): \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \) (odd case): \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 500 \) (even case): \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 3 \) (even case): \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) for each test case.
   - This value of \( y \) maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for both even and odd \( x \).

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct as it satisfies the problem description for all valid inputs.
