Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 2, `y` is equal to the new value of `x` // 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to a new input integer, which is still greater than 2.
- The value of `y` is recalculated as the integer division of the new value of `x` by 2.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
