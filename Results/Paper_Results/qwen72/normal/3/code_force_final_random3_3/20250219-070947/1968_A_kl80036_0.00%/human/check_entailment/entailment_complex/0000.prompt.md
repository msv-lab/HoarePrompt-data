Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer x as input where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and it should be called multiple times with different values of x, each time finding an integer y such that 1 ≤ y < x and \gcd(x, y) + y is maximized.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: `i` is equal to the user-provided number of iterations (an integer between 2 and 1000), `x` is the last input integer provided (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and `y` is equal to `x // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer from the user, which represents the number of iterations to perform. For each iteration, it reads another integer `x` (where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000) and calculates `y` as `x // 2`. It then prints `y` for each iteration. After the function concludes, the number of iterations `i` is equal to the user-provided number of iterations, `x` is the last input integer provided (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000), and `y` is equal to `x // 2` for the last iteration. The function does not return any value.
