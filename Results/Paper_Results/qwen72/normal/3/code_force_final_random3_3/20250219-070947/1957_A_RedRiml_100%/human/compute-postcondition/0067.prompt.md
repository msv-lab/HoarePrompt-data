Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is an empty list, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `palka` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` if `i` was not already in `pl`. `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `palka` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with the first element of `palka` and `i` as keys. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` and possibly `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`. `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `palka` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with the first, second, and third elements of `palka` as keys, and their respective counts as values. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, possibly the second element if it was not already in `pl`, and if `i` was not in `pl`, it now includes the third element of `palka`. `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `palka` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
