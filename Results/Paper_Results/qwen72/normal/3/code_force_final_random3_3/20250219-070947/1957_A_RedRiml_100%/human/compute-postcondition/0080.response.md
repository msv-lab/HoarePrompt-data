Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed when the `print(shapes)` statement executes.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **`n`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) for each test case. This represents the number of elements in the list `palka` for each test case.
3. **`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`**: Integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\). These are the elements of the list `palka`.
4. **`w`**: An integer greater than 1. This variable is not used in the given code snippet.
5. **`_`**: An integer with the value 1. This variable is not used in the given code snippet.
6. **`ln`**: An input integer. This variable is not used in the given code snippet.
7. **`palka`**: A list of integers input by the user.
8. **`d`**: A dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`.
9. **`pl`**: A list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
10. **`shapes`**: The sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(shapes)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`palka`**: This is a list of integers provided by the user. Each integer \(a_i\) in `palka` is such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\).
2. **`d`**: This dictionary is constructed by counting the occurrences of each integer in `palka`. For example, if `palka` is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, then `d` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4}`.
3. **`pl`**: This list contains all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared. Using the same example, `pl` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
4. **`shapes`**: This variable is calculated as the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3. In the example, the counts of 3 and 4 are 3 and 4, respectively. The integer division of 3 by 3 is 1, and the integer division of 4 by 3 is 1. Therefore, `shapes` would be \(1 + 1 = 2\).

### Final Output:
The `print(shapes)` statement will print the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3.

Since the exact values of `palka` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `shapes`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3)**
