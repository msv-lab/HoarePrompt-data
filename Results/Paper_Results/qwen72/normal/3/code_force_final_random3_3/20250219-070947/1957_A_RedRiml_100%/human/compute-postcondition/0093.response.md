Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is a list containing the first integer `i` from `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3, `i` is the first integer in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 1 (if `i` was not initially in `d`) or incremented by 1 (if `i` was already in `d`).**
