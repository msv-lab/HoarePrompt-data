Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `pl` is a list containing the first integer `i` from `palka` if `i` was not initially in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `i` was not initially in `d`, its value is set to 1. If `i` was already in `d`, its value is incremented by 1, and `i` is appended to `pl`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pl.append(i)` appends the second integer `i` from `palka` to the list `pl`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The list `pl` now contains the first integer from `palka` (if it was not already in `pl`) and the second integer from `palka`.
- The dictionary `d` contains the second integer `i` from `palka` as a key, with its value set to 1 if it was not already in `d`, or incremented by 1 if it was already in `d`.
- The value of `shapes` is still the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3, but this value may change if `i` is appended to `pl` and it appears at least 3 times.
