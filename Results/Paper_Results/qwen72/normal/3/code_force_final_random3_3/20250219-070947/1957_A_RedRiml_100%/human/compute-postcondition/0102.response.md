Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `pl` is a list containing the first integer `i` from `palka` if `i` was not initially in `pl`, otherwise `pl` remains unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3, `i` is the third integer in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value set to 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to 1.
- Since `i` is the third integer in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key, the value of `i` in `d` is now 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
