To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `palka`. The loop will execute if `palka` is not empty. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100
- `w` is greater than 1
- `_` is 1
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers input by the user
- `d` is an empty dictionary
- `pl` is an empty list
- `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `palka` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`

To ensure the loop executes, `palka` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `palka` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `palka`, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is an empty list, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `palka` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`**
