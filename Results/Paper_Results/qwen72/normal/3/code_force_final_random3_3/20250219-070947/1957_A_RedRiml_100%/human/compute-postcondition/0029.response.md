To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `pl`.

1. **`j`**: This variable will be assigned values from the list `pl` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
2. **`pl`**: This list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once. According to the given state, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared. For the loop to execute, `pl` must have at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100
- `w` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers with `n` elements
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`
- `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared
- `shapes` is 0

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `pl` has at least one element. This can be achieved if `palka` has at least one unique integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 1 element, `shapes` is 0**
