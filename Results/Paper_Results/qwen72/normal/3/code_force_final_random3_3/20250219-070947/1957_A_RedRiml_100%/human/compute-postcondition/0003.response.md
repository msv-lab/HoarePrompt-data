Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores the result in the list `palka`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, and `ln` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `palka` is now a list of integers, where each integer is within the range 1 to 100, as specified by the precondition.
