Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique integer in `pl` that appear at least 3 times by 3, `i` is the first integer in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `i` was not initially in `d`, it is added with a value of 1. If `i` was already in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.**
