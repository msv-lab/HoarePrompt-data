Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
- The current value of `b` is less than or equal to `a`.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(n * a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `n` is an input integer, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `a` is an input integer, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `b` is an input integer, and it is known that \(b \leq a\).

2. **Expression in the Print Statement:**
   - The expression `n * a` multiplies the integer `n` by the integer `a`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, the output will be the product of these two integers.
   - The value of `b` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

### Final Output:
The `print(n * a)` statement will print the product of the integers `n` and `a`.
Output: **n * a (where n and a are input integers)**
