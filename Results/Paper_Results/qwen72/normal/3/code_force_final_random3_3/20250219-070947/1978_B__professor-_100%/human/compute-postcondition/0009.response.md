To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the expression step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
   - `b` is greater than `a`.
   - `b - a` is less than `n`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is: `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.
   - Let's break it down into smaller parts:
     - `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first \((b - a)\) natural numbers. This is derived from the formula for the sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers: \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\).
     - `a * n` is simply the product of `a` and `n`.
     - The entire expression is then converted to an integer using the `int` function.

3. **Detailed Calculation:**
   - **Sum of the first \((b - a)\) natural numbers:**
     - This is \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2}\).
   - **Product of `a` and `n`:**
     - This is \(a \times n\).
   - **Combining the results:**
     - The expression becomes: \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\).
   - **Converting to an integer:**
     - Since the division `//` is integer division, the result of \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2}\) is already an integer. Adding \(a \times n\) (which is also an integer) results in an integer, and the `int` function will not change the value.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the integer value of the expression \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\).

Output: **\(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\) (where \(b - a\) is the difference between `b` and `a`, and \(a \times n\) is the product of `a` and `n`)**
