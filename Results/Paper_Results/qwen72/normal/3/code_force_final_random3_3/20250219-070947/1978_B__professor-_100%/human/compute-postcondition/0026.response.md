Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the conditions and corresponding outputs have been evaluated and printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the initial value of `t` remains the same, and the loop has processed `t` test cases. For each test case, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` were read from the input, and the appropriate output was calculated and printed based on the conditions specified in the loop. The loop has finished running, and all the test cases have been handled.
