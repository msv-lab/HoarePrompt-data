The value of `best_y` is appended to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `best_y` is updated to 1 if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1` where `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `best_y` will be 1. Therefore, 1 is appended to the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the values of `best_y` (which is 1), `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + 1` and `best_y` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
