Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_sum = gcd_val + y` updates the value of `current_sum` to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`.
- `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 3`.
- `y` is `x - 3`.
- `current_sum` is now `gcd_val + (x - 3)`.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `y`, and `gcd_val` remain unchanged.
- `max_sum` and `best_y` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain unchanged.
