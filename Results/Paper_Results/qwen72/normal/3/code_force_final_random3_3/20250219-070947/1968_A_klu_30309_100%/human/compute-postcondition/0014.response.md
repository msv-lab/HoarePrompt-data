Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list and must be at least 2, `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_sum = gcd_val + y` updates the value of `current_sum` to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`.
- The value of `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
- The value of `y` is `x - 2`.
- The value of `current_sum` is now `gcd_val + y`, which simplifies to `gcd_val + (x - 2)`.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` remain unchanged unless `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, in which case `max_sum` and `best_y` are updated and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since the code snippet only updates `current_sum`, the other variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
