Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the values of `best_y` (which is 1), `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `max_sum` to 0.
- The initial state specifies that `max_sum` was not explicitly defined, so it is now set to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
