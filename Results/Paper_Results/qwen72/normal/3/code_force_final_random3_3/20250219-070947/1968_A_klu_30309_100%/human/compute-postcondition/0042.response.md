Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x - 2`.** 

The code updates `max_sum` to the value of `current_sum`, which is `gcd_val + y`. Since `current_sum` was already greater than or equal to `max_sum` (as per the initial state), `max_sum` now holds the value `gcd_val + y`. Additionally, `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
