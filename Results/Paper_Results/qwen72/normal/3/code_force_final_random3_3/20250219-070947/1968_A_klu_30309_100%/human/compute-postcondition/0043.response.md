Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in the list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `best_y = y` assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`.
- Since `y` is already defined as `x - 2`, `best_y` is now also `x - 2`.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `results`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `best_y` is now explicitly `x - 2`.
