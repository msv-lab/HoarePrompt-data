Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the loop where it calculates the best `y`. The issue lies in the `break` statement, which causes the loop to terminate prematurely after the first iteration where a `y` is found that has a greater `gcd(x, y) + y` value than the initial `max_sum` (which is 0). This means the program does not necessarily find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `x`, but rather the first `y` it encounters that satisfies the condition.

To correct this, the `break` statement should be removed, allowing the loop to continue and check all possible values of `y` to ensure the maximum value is found. Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
        results.append(best_y)
    return results
```

With this correction, the program will correctly find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for each `x`.
