Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, plus `i` (which is `len(a) - 1`), `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2, and if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] != 2`, the current value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`. `tmp` must contain at least one element. `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `y -= i - 1` subtracts `i - 1` from `y`.
- Given that `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, after the subtraction, `y` becomes 0.
- The values of `a`, `ans`, `i`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `tmp` must contain at least one element is still valid.
- The initial state of `a` being sorted in ascending order, `ans` being calculated as described, `i` being `len(a) - 1`, and `tmp` being a sorted list as described are all still valid.
