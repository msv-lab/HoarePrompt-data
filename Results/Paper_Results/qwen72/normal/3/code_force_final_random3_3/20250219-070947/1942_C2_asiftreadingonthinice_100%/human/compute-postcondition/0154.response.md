Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, plus `i`, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`.
- The other variables (`a`, `ans`, `i`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `a` is sorted in ascending order still holds.
- The initial value of `ans` is still the same, which is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, plus `i`.
- The value of `i` is still the next element in `tmp`.
- The updated value of `y` is `y - (i - 1)`.
