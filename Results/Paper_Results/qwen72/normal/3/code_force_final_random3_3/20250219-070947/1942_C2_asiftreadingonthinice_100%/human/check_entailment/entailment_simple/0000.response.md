Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem statement.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `tt` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of vertices `a`.

2. **Sorting the Vertices**:
   - The vertices `a` are sorted, which is necessary to correctly calculate the gaps between consecutive vertices.

3. **Initial Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is based on the idea that each chosen vertex (except the first and last) can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices, and the additional `y` vertices can be used to form more triangles.

4. **Handling Gaps Between Vertices**:
   - The function iterates over the sorted list `a` to find gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is 2, it means there is exactly one vertex between the two chosen vertices, which can form a triangle, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is an even number greater than 2, the function appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. This value represents the number of potential triangles that can be formed by choosing the middle vertices in the gap.

5. **Handling the Gap Between the Last and First Vertices**:
   - The function also checks the gap between the last and first vertices in the sorted list, which is calculated as `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]`.
   - Similar to the previous step, if the gap is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is an even number greater than 2, the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`.

6. **Optimizing the Number of Triangles**:
   - The list `tmp` is sorted to prioritize smaller gaps first.
   - The function then iterates over `tmp` and checks if the remaining `y` vertices can be used to form additional triangles. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, it means we can use `i - 1` vertices to form `i` triangles, and `ans` is updated accordingly.
   - If `y` is less than `i - 1`, the loop breaks, as we cannot form more triangles with the remaining vertices.

7. **Final Adjustment and Output**:
   - The function adds any remaining `y` vertices to `ans` to account for any additional triangles that can be formed.
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, but it is capped at `n - 2` to ensure it does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles in a polygon with `n` sides.

8. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that `x` and `y` are within the specified limits.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It follows the logic of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing additional vertices and forming triangles based on the gaps between chosen vertices.

Correctness: **True**
