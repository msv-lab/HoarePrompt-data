Postcondition: ***`a` is sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. If this difference is an even number, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.***
