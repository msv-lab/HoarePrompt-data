Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element (`a[1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the list `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference is not 2 and is an even number, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains undefined.***
