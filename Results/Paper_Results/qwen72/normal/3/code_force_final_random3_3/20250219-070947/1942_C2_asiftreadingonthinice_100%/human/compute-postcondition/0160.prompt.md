Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is not properly defined to solve the given problem. It should accept parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` vertices. The parameters should satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the list of vertices should contain `x` distinct integers from 1 to n. `tt` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
    tmp.sort()
    for i in tmp:
        if y >= i - 1:
            ans += i
            y -= i - 1
        else:
            break
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp` that were less than or equal to `y + 1` at the start of the loop, plus the final value of `y`, and `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2, and `tmp` may have elements remaining if `y` was not large enough to process all elements in `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has finished executing, and `ans` has been updated by adding the values of `i` from `tmp` for which `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1`, plus the final value of `y`. `y` has been decreased by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all such values of `i`. The remaining variables (`a`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`) are unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, plus the final value of `y` after the loop, `y` is 0, `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] != 2`, the current value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
