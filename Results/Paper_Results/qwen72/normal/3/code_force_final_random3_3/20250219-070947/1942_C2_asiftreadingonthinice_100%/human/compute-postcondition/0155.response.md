Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, `y` is 0, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The code snippet `break` causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of `a` and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `y` is set to 0, and `i` is updated to the next element in `tmp`. The precondition that `tmp` must contain at least one more element is still valid.
