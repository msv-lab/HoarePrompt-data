Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition, `tmp` is an empty list, `ii` is `len(a)`, `tt` must be greater than `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `tmp = []` reassigns `tmp` to an empty list.
- All other variables (`a`, `i`, `ans`, `y`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
