Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value of `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` if the difference is an even number.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial state specifies that `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is 2. However, the code snippet provided does not check this condition, so we can only state that `ans` is increased by 1. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged. The state of `tmp` is only affected if the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is an even number, but since the code snippet does not modify `tmp`, its state remains as described in the initial state.
