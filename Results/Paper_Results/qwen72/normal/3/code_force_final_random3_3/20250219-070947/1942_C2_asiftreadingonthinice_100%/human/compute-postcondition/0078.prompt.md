Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition, `tmp` is an empty list, `ii` is `len(a)`, `tt` must be greater than `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`. `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition. `tmp` is an empty list if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not an even number, otherwise `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. `ii` is `len(a)`, `tt` must be greater than `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `len(a)` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition, `ii` is `len(a)`, `tt` is greater than `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. Otherwise, if the difference is an even number, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. If the difference is not an even number, `tmp` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `len(a)` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition, `ii` is `len(a)`, `tt` is greater than `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2 or an even number, and the if condition `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2` is false, `tmp` contains an additional value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
