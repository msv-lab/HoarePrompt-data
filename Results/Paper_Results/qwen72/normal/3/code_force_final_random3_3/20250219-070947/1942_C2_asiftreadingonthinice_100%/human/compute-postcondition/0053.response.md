Let's break down the initial state and the code to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements.
2. `i` is `len(a) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
3. `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus:
   - The number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2.
   - The sum of all elements in `tmp` that were less than or equal to `y + 1` at the start of the loop.
   - The final value of `y`.
4. `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition.
5. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2. `tmp` may have elements remaining if `y` was not large enough to process all elements in `tmp`.
6. `n` is the length of the list `a`.

### Code:
```python
print(min(ans, n - 2))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a` and `i`**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is the index of the last element in `a`.

2. **List `tmp`**:
   - `tmp` is derived from the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 18]`, the differences are `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]`. The even differences that are not 2 are `[4]`, and `tmp` would be `[2]` (4 divided by 2).

3. **Variable `ans`**:
   - `ans` starts with the value `x + y - 2`.
   - It is then incremented by:
     - The number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2.
     - The sum of all elements in `tmp` that were less than or equal to `y + 1` at the start of the loop.
     - The final value of `y`.

4. **Variable `y`**:
   - `y` is modified in a loop where it subtracts values from `tmp` until `y` is less than the next value in `tmp` or `tmp` is exhausted.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The `print` statement outputs the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `a = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 18]`
- `x = 10`
- `y = 5`

1. **Differences in `a`**:
   - Differences: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]`
   - `tmp` (even differences not equal to 2, divided by 2): `[2]`

2. **Initial `ans`**:
   - `ans = x + y - 2 = 10 + 5 - 2 = 13`

3. **Number of times difference is exactly 2**:
   - There are 5 differences of 2 in `a`.
   - `ans += 5 = 13 + 5 = 18`

4. **Sum of elements in `tmp` less than or equal to `y + 1`**:
   - `y + 1 = 6`
   - `tmp = [2]` (all elements are less than or equal to 6)
   - Sum of elements in `tmp`: `2`
   - `ans += 2 = 18 + 2 = 20`

5. **Final value of `y`**:
   - `y` is modified by subtracting elements from `tmp`.
   - `y -= 2 = 5 - 2 = 3`
   - `ans += 3 = 20 + 3 = 23`

6. **Length of `a`**:
   - `n = len(a) = 8`

7. **Final `print` statement**:
   - `min(ans, n - 2) = min(23, 6) = 6`

### Output:
Output: **6 (where 6 is the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`, and `ans` is the calculated value based on the initial state and the given conditions)**
