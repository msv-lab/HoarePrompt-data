The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the parameters `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It calculates a value `ans` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list of integers and the value of `y`. The final value of `ans` is adjusted and printed, ensuring it does not exceed `n - 2`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state includes the printed results for each test case. The function does not return any value.
