Reasoning:
The program aims to find the MEX of the array `c` that is constructed during the game, where Alice and Bob play optimally. The optimal strategy for Alice is to ensure that the smallest non-negative integers are included in `c` as much as possible, while Bob's strategy is to prevent Alice from achieving this.

The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`. It then iterates through the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive) to determine the MEX of the array `c` that would result from optimal play.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: The program counts how many times each integer appears in the array `a`.
2. **Finding MEX**: It iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` and checks:
   - If an integer `i` does not appear in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), it returns `i` because this is the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 1`), it increments a counter `t` to track how many such unique integers have been found.
   - If `t` reaches 2, it means there are two unique integers that appear exactly once, and the MEX of `c` would be `i` because Bob can choose one of these unique integers, and Alice will not be able to form a smaller MEX.

The logic is correct because:
- Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` or that appears exactly once.
- Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once to prevent Alice from forming a smaller MEX.

The program correctly identifies the MEX based on the optimal strategies of both players.

Correctness: **True**
