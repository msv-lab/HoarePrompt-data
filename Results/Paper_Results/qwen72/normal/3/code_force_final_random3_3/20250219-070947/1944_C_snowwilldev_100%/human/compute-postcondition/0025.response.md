Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `0` to `N-1`, and `cnt[i]` is not 0. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is 2 and the program returns 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 1 and the program does not return, leaving the state unchanged.***
