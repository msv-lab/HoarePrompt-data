Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `N` must be greater than or equal to 0, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `0` to `N-1`, `t` is 0, and `cnt[i]` is 1.** 

This means that after entering the if condition, the following is true:
- `i` is still 0.
- `N` is still greater than or equal to 0.
- The `cnt` array has been updated such that `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `0` to `N-1`.
- `t` remains 0.
- The value of `cnt[i]` is 1, indicating that the element `a[j]` that equals `i` (which is 0) appears exactly once in the array `a`.
