#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < n for all elements a_i in the list `a`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: `i` is `N-1`, `N` remains the same, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `0` to `N-1`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: `i` is `N`, `N` remains the same, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `0` to `N-1`, and `t` is the number of unique elements in `cnt` that have a count of 1. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program returns `i`. Otherwise, the program does not return and the state remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `a` from the input. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. The function iterates through the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive) and checks the count of each integer. If it finds two or more unique integers that occur exactly once, or if it finds an integer that does not occur in the list, it returns the first such integer. If no such integer is found, the function does not return a value and the state remains unchanged.
