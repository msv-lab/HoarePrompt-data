Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that Bob can choose elements that are not in the optimal path to minimize the MEX.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this test case, the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 2. Now, `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
2. Bob picks 0. Now, `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
3. Alice picks 1. Now, `a = [2]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
4. Bob picks 2. Now, `a = []` and `c = [2, 1]`.

The MEX of `c = [2, 1]` is 3, but the program returns 2 because it does not correctly simulate the optimal play for both players. The program only checks the count of each element and returns the first index where the count is 0 or the count of two elements is 1, which is not the correct approach to determine the MEX in this game.
