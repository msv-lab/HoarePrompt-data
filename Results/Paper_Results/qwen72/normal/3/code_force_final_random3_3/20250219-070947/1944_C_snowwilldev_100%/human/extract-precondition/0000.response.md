Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < n for all elements a_i in the list `a`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def game_score(a, n):
```

Given this, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **a is a list of integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < n for all elements a_i in the list a.**
