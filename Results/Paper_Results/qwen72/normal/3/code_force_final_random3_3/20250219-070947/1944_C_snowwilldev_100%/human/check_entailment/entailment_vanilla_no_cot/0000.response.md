Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem based on the provided problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements**: It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, and Bob will try to minimize it.
   - The key insight is that if an element `i` appears exactly once in the array `a`, Alice can always choose it to ensure it is included in `c` before Bob can choose it. If an element `i` appears more than once, Bob can choose one of the duplicates to prevent Alice from including it in `c`.
   - The program iterates through the possible values from `0` to `N` and checks the count of each value. If a value `i` has a count of `1`, Alice can include it in `c`. If a value `i` has a count of `0` or if two values with a count of `1` have been included in `c`, the program returns `i` as the MEX of `c`.

4. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program maintains a counter `t` to track how many elements with a count of `1` have been included in `c`.
   - If `t` reaches `2` or if an element `i` has a count of `0`, the program returns `i` as the MEX of `c`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.
