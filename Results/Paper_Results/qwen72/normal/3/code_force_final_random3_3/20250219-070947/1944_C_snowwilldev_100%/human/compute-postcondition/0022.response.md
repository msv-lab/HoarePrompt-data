Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range `0` to `N-1`, and `cnt[i]` is not 0. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is 2. Otherwise, `t` remains 1. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program returns 1. Otherwise, the program does not return and the state remains unchanged.***
