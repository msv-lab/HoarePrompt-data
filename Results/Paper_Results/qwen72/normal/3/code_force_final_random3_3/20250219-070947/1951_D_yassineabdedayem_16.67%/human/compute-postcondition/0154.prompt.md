Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    rep = 0
    number = 0
    tab = []
    while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
        Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
        if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
            number = Min
            k = k - Max
        else:
            number = Max
            k = k - Min
        tab.append(str(number))
        n -= Min * Max
        rep += 1
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(tab))
        for i in tab:
            print(i, end=' ')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations, `k` is a positive integer that has been reduced by the sum of all `Min` or `Max` values subtracted from it over the iterations, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations. If `k` is 0, `tab` has all its elements printed, and `i` is the last element of `tab`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string elements, each representing a value of `number` from each iteration, `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop. If `k` is 0, `tab` contains `rep` string elements, and `i` is the last string element in `tab`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values generated during each iteration, and `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop. If `k` is 0, the program maintains all the above conditions. Otherwise, if `k` is a positive integer less than the initial `k` and the loop conditions are no longer met, the program also maintains all the above conditions, with the additional note that `k` is not equal to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
