### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
   - Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `rep` to count the number of stalls set up, `number` to store the price per jewel for the current stall, and `tab` to store the prices of all stalls.
   - The program then enters a loop to set up the stalls:
     - It calculates `Min` as the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
     - It calculates `Max` as the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
     - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets the price per jewel to `Min` and reduces `k` by `Max`.
     - Otherwise, it sets the price per jewel to `Max` and reduces `k` by `Min`.
     - It appends the price to `tab` and updates `n` by subtracting the total cost of the jewels bought from the current stall.
     - It increments `rep` to count the number of stalls set up.
   - The loop continues until `n` is zero, `k` is zero, `rep` reaches 60, or `n` is less than `k`.
   - If `k` is zero after the loop, it prints "YES" and the prices of the stalls.
   - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
   - The loop ensures that Bob sets up at most 60 stalls.
   - The prices are calculated to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The conditions in the loop ensure that the prices are within the valid range and that Alice's coins are sufficient to buy the required number of jewels.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is less than `k` by correctly printing "NO".
   - The program handles the case where `k` is zero by correctly printing "YES" and the prices of the stalls.
   - The program ensures that the number of stalls set up does not exceed 60.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The output format matches the problem description: "YES" or "NO" followed by the number of stalls and the prices if the answer is "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided constraints and requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
