Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is 0 or a positive integer less than the initial `k` and such that the loop conditions are no longer met, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values generated during each iteration, and `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an input integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- **`_`**: Remains 2, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: After the loop completes, `n` will be the remaining value after all iterations. This value will be the result of subtracting the products of `Min` and `Max` from the initial `n` during each iteration.
- **`k`**: `k` will be 0 or a positive integer less than its initial value. The loop will stop if `k` becomes 0, `n` becomes 0, or the loop has executed 60 times.
- **`rep`**: This will be the total number of times the loop executed, which is at most 60.
- **`tab`**: This list will contain the string representations of the `number` values generated during each iteration of the loop.
- **`number`**: This will be the last value of `number` generated in the loop, which is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the conditions checked within the loop.
