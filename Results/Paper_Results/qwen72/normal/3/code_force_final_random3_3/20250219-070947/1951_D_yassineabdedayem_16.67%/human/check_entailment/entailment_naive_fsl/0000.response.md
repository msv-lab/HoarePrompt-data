Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `k`. According to the problem description, if Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it should be impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, the program does not handle this edge case correctly. For example, if the input is `n = 5` and `k = 6`, the program should output "NO" because Alice cannot buy 6 jewels with only 5 coins. Instead, the program enters the while loop and attempts to set up stalls, which is incorrect.
