The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, and an additional parameter `t` that represents the number of test cases. Each of `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `t` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers with 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
