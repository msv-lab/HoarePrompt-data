Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values generated during each iteration, and `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop. If `k` is 0, the program maintains all the above conditions. Otherwise, if `k` is a positive integer less than the initial `k` and the loop conditions are no longer met, the program also maintains all the above conditions, with the additional note that `k` is not equal to 0.***
