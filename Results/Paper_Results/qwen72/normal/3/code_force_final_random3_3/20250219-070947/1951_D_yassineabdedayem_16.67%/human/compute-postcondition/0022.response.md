Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero, `k` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `number` is assigned the value of `Max`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `number` is now equal to `Max`, which is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
