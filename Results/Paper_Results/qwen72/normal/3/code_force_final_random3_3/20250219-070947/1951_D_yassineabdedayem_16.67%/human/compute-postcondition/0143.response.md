To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(tab))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context of the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60).
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values generated during each iteration.
   - `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop.

2. **Loop Context:**
   - The loop likely iterates a certain number of times (up to 60) and generates a `number` value in each iteration.
   - Each `number` value is converted to a string and added to the list `tab`.

3. **Determine the Length of `tab`:**
   - The length of `tab` is determined by the number of iterations the loop completes.
   - The variable `rep` indicates the number of times the loop executed, which is up to 60.

Given the initial state and the context, the length of `tab` will be equal to the number of iterations the loop completed, which is stored in `rep`.

Output: **rep (where rep is the number of times the loop executed, up to 60)**
