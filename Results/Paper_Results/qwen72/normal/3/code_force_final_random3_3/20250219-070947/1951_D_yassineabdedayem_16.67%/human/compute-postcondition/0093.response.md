To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `tab`.

1. **`i`**: This variable will be assigned the elements of `tab` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly defined, but it will take on the values of the elements in `tab` as the loop progresses.
2. **`tab`**: This list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string elements, each representing a value of `number` from each iteration.

Given that the loop will execute if `tab` has at least one element, we need to ensure that `tab` is not empty. The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `tab` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop and is currently 0, `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing at least 1 string element, `i` is the first string element in `tab`**
