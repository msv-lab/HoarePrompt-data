Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations, `k` is a positive integer that has been reduced by the sum of all `Min` or `Max` values subtracted from it over the iterations, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations. If `k` is 0, `tab` has all its elements printed, and `i` is the last element of `tab`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0.**
