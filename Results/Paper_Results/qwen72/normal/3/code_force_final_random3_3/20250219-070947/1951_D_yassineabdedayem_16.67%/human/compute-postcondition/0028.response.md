To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

1. `n != 0`: `n` must be non-zero.
2. `k > 0`: `k` must be greater than 0.
3. `rep < 60`: `rep` must be less than 60.
4. `n >= k`: `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this is not relevant to the loop conditions).
- `_` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop conditions).
- `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero.
- `k` is updated to be greater than 0.
- `rep` is 2.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it (this is not relevant to the loop conditions).
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is `Max`.

Let's break down the conditions:
- `n` must be non-zero and `n >= k` must hold true.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `rep` must be less than 60.

From the state:
- `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero. This means `n` is updated in each iteration, and it must still be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to continue.
- `k` is updated to be greater than 0, so it must remain positive.
- `rep` is 2, which is less than 60, so it meets the condition.

Given that `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero, and `k` is updated to be greater than 0, the only adjustments needed are to ensure that `n` is still non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`.

Since `n` and `k` are the only variables in the loop head that can be adjusted, and they are already updated in the loop body to meet the conditions, no further adjustments are necessary.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero, `k` is updated to be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**
