Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations, `k` is currently 0, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` has all its elements printed, and `i` is the last element of `tab`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The variable `_` remains 0, as it is not modified in the loop.
- The variable `n` is still the remainder after subtracting all `Min * Max` values from the initial `n` over the iterations.
- The variable `k` is still 0, as it is not modified in the loop.
- The variable `rep` remains 60 or less, as it is not modified in the loop.
- The list `tab` has all its elements printed, one by one, separated by spaces.
- The variable `i` is the last element of `tab` when the loop finishes executing.
