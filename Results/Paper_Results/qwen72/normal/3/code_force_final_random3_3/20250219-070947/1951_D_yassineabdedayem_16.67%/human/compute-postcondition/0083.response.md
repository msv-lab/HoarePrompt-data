Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing two string elements, where the first element is the initial string and the second element is `str(Max)`. `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`, and `k` is updated to `k - Min`. `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `number = Max` assigns the value of `Max` to `number`.
- The value of `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, so `number` is now equal to `Max`.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`) remain unchanged.
- The second element of `tab` is updated to `str(Max)`.
- The values of `Min`, `Max`, and `k` are still as defined in the initial state, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` as specified in the initial state.
