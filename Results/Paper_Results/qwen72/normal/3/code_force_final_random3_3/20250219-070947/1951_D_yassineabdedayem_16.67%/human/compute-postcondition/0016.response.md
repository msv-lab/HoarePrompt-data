Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `Min` and `Max` are still determined by the initial conditions, and their impact on `n` is reflected in the new value of `n`.
- The conditions for `number` and `k` are still valid based on the updated value of `n`.
