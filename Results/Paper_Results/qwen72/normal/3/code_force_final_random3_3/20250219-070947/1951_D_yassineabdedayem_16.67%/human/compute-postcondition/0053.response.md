Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `rep` is 60 or less, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values appended during the iterations. If `k` is 0, `tab` has all its elements printed, and `i` is the last element of `tab`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
- `n` and `k` are reassigned to the first and second integers read from the input, respectively.
- The values of `rep` and `tab` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `k` and `tab` remains the same as in the initial state.
