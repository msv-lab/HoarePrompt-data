Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is `k - Max` and must be greater than 0, and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - Min` and must be greater than 0, and `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`.
- The initial state specifies that `tab` already contains the string representation of `number`.
- After appending, `tab` will contain two string representations of `number`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the value of `number` might have been updated based on the conditions provided in the initial state.
- The initial conditions for `n`, `Min`, `Max`, and `k` are still valid after the code execution.
