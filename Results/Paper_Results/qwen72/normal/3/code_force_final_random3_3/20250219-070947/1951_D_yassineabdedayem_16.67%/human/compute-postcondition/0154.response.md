Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60) for the last test case, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values generated during each iteration for the last test case, and `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop for the last test case. If `k` is 0, the program prints 'YES', the length of `tab`, and all elements in `tab` separated by spaces. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- After all iterations, the loop variable `_` will be `t - 1` because the loop starts from 0 and runs up to `t - 1`.
- For each test case, the variables `n` and `k` are updated based on the logic inside the loop. `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the inner while loop, and `k` is the remaining value after being reduced by the sum of all `Min` or `Max` values subtracted from it.
- The variable `rep` keeps track of the number of iterations of the inner while loop for the last test case, and it will be at most 60.
- The list `tab` contains the string representations of the `number` values generated during each iteration of the inner while loop for the last test case.
- The variable `number` holds the last value of `number` generated in the inner while loop for the last test case.
- If `k` is 0 after the inner while loop completes, the program prints 'YES', the length of `tab`, and all elements in `tab` separated by spaces. If `k` is not 0, the program prints 'NO'.
