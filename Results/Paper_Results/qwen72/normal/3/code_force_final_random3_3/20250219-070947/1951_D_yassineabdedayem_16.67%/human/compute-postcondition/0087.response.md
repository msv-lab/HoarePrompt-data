Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing three string elements, where the first element is the initial string, the second element is `str(number)`, and the third element is either `str(Min)` or `str(Max)` depending on the conditions.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `rep`, and the list `tab` remain unchanged.
- The third element of `tab` remains either `str(Min)` or `str(Max)` based on the initial conditions.
