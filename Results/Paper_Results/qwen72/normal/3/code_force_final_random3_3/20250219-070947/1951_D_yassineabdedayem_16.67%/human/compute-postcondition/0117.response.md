Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be non-zero, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than zero, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` and `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The code `tab.append(str(number))` adds the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`.
- The value of `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, depending on the initial conditions.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged, except for the state of `k` and `number` which might have been updated based on the conditions provided in the initial state.
