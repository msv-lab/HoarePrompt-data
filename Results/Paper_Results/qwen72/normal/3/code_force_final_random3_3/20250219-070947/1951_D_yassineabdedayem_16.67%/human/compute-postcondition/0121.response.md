Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`, otherwise `k` is 0 and must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `number` is `Max`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`.**

In natural language: The initial values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` remain unchanged. The values of `Min` and `Max` are updated to `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` respectively. The conditions for `n` and `k` remain the same, and `tab` still contains the string representation of `number`.
