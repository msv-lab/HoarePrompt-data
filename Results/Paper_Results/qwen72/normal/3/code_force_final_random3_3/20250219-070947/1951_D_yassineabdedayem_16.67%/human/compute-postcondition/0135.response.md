Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of the updated `number`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` is now equal to `k - Min`, `number` is now equal to `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `Min` and `Max` depend on the values of `n` and `k`, but the relationship between `k` and `Min` is now `k = k - Min`.
- `number` is still equal to `Max`, which is `max(int(n / k), k)`.
