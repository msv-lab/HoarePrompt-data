Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`, otherwise `k` is 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `number` is `Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` is updated based on the conditions provided: if `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is set to 0. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - min(n // k, k)`.
- `number` is set to `Max`.
- The initial conditions for `n` and `k` (i.e., `n` must be non-zero and `k` must be greater than zero, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`) are still valid, but the specific values of `n` and `k` have been updated.
