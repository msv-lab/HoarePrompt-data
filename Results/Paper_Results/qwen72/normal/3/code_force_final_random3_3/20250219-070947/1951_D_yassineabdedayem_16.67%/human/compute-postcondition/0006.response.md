To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

1. `n != 0`
2. `k > 0`
3. `rep < 60`
4. `n >= k`

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (this variable is not involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `_` is 0 (this variable is not involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `rep` is 0.
- `number` is 0 (this variable is not involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).
- `tab` is an empty list (this variable is not involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted).

Now, let's check each condition:
1. `n != 0`: For the loop to execute, `n` must not be 0. Since `n` is an integer read from the input, it can be any integer. We need to ensure that `n` is not 0.
2. `k > 0`: For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. Since `k` is an integer read from the input, it can be any integer. We need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.
3. `rep < 60`: `rep` is 0, which is less than 60. This condition is already satisfied.
4. `n >= k`: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`. Since `n` and `k` are both integers read from the input, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be a non-zero integer.
- `k` must be a positive integer.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list**
