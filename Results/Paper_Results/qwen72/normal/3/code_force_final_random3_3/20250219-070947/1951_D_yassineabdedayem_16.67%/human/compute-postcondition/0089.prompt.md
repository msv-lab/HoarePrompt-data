Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Max` if `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `k` is `k - Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string element `str(number)`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Min` if `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing two string elements, where the first element is the initial string and the second element is `str(number)`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `tab` contains `str(Min)` as the second element, `k` is updated to `k - Max`, and `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `tab` contains `str(Max)` as the second element, `k` is updated to `k - Min`, and `number` is `Max`. `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 3, `tab` is a list containing three string elements, where the first element is the initial string, the second element is `str(number)`, and the third element is either `str(Min)` or `str(Max)` depending on the conditions.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
