Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical error in the way it calculates the prices for the stalls. Specifically, the logic for setting `Min` and `Max` and then adjusting `n` and `k` is flawed. The conditions and the way the prices are assigned do not always ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. 

Here's a more straightforward approach to solve the problem:

1. If `k` is 1, Bob can set up a single stall with a price of `n` coins, ensuring Alice buys exactly one jewel.
2. If `k` is greater than 1, Bob can set up `k` stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly one jewel from each stall. The prices can be set to `n // k` for the first `k-1` stalls and the remaining coins for the last stall.

This approach ensures that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, and it will always be possible as long as `k` is not greater than 60.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k > 60:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        if k == 1:
            print(n)
        else:
            for i in range(k - 1):
                price = n // k
                print(price, end=' ')
                n -= price
            print(n)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that Bob can always set up the stalls and prices correctly to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels, as long as `k` is within the allowed limit of 60.
