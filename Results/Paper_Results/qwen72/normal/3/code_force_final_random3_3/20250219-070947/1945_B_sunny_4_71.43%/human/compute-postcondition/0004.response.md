Output State: **`a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**

Explanation:
- `B` is assigned the value `int(m / b) + 1`.
- The value of `B` depends on the values of `m` and `b`.
- The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `m`, `t`, `_`, `A`) remain unchanged.
