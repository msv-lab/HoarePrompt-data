Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, where `a` and `b` are the frequencies of launching fireworks for two installations, and `m` is the visibility duration of each firework. It calculates the total number of distinct moments when at least one firework is visible by computing `A = int(m / a) + 1` and `B = int(m / b) + 1`, and then prints the sum `A + B`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. **
