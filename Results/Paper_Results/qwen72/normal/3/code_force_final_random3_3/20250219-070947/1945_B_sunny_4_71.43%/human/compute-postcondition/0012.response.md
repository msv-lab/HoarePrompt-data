Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned new integer values from the input, `t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`.**

The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to new integer values provided by the input. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `A` and `B` are recalculated based on the new values of `a` and `b` using the expressions `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1` respectively.
