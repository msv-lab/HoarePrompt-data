Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned new integer values from the input, `t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`.**

The value of `A` is updated to `int(m / a) + 1`. The values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged. `B` is still equal to `int(m / b) + 1`.
