The function `func` accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `m`. `a` and `b` are the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and `m` is the visibility duration of each firework. All parameters are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. The function returns the total number of distinct moments when at least one firework is visible.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `m`, representing the frequencies of launching fireworks for two installations and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively. It returns the total number of distinct moments when at least one firework is visible.**
