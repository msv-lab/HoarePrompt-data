You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a', and `decoded` is a list containing the corresponding lowercase Latin letters for each character in `encoded` based on the `mapping`.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the elements of the `decoded` list, which contains the corresponding lowercase Latin letters for each character in `encoded` based on the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and returns a new string formed by converting each character in `encoded` to its corresponding lowercase Latin letter using a `mapping` dictionary.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string formed by joining the elements of the `decoded` list, which contains the corresponding lowercase Latin letters for each character in `encoded` based on the `mapping` dictionary.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
