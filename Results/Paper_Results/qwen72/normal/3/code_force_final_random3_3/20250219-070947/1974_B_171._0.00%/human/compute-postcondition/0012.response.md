Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with the entry `{'a': char, 'b': char}`, `decoded` is an empty list, `c` is 98, and `char` is not in `mapping` except for the entries `{'a': char}` and `{'b': char}`.**

Explanation:
- `encoded` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character.
- `char` remains the first character in `encoded`.
- `mapping` initially contains the entry `{'a': char}` if `char` is not already in `mapping.values()`. After the code execution, `mapping` now also contains the entry `{'b': char}` because `chr(c)` ('b') is not in `mapping.values()`.
- `decoded` remains an empty list.
- `c` remains 98.
- `char` is still not in `mapping` except for the entries `{'a': char}` and `{'b': char}`.
