Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a', and `decoded` is a list containing the corresponding lowercase Latin letters for each character in `encoded` based on the `mapping`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The `encoded` string remains unchanged.
- The `mapping` dictionary will contain a mapping from each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter starting from 'a'. For example, if `encoded` is "abc", then `mapping` will be `{'a': 'a', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'c'}`.
- The `decoded` list will contain the corresponding lowercase Latin letters for each character in `encoded` based on the `mapping`. For example, if `encoded` is "abc", then `decoded` will be `['a', 'b', 'c']`. If `encoded` has repeated characters, they will be replaced by the same corresponding letter in `decoded`.
