### Reasoning:

The given program aims to decode an encoded string based on the described encoding algorithm. However, the implementation in `func_1` does not correctly follow the decoding process. Here's why:

1. **Encoding Algorithm Recap**:
   - The original string `s` is transformed into a new string `r` which contains all distinct letters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. For example, if `r` is "cdefors", 'c' is replaced by 's', 'd' by 'r', 'e' by 'o', and so on.

2. **Decoding Algorithm**:
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process. Given an encoded string `b`, we need to:
     - Construct the string `r` from the distinct characters in `b` in alphabetical order.
     - Replace each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `r`.

3. **Current Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` creates a dictionary `mapping` and a list `decoded`.
   - It iterates over each character in `encoded` and checks if the character is already in the `mapping` dictionary.
   - If the character is not in the `mapping`, it assigns the next available lowercase letter (starting from 'a') to the character and adds it to the `mapping`.
   - Finally, it appends the corresponding character from the `mapping` to the `decoded` list and returns the joined string.

4. **Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not construct the string `r` from the distinct characters in `encoded` in alphabetical order.
   - Instead, it assigns the next available lowercase letter to each unique character in `encoded`, which is not the correct way to decode the string.
   - The correct approach should involve creating the string `r` and then mapping each character in `encoded` to its symmetric character in `r`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly decode the string as per the problem description. It assigns arbitrary mappings instead of using the symmetric characters in the alphabetically ordered string `r`. Therefore, the output will not match the expected decoded string.
