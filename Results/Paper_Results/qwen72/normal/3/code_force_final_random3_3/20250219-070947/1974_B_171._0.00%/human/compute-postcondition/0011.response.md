The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `c`. The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` (which is 97) to `ord('z') + 1` (which is 123). At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 97. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is a dictionary with the entry `{'a': char}` if `chr(c)` (which is 'a') is not in `mapping.values()`, otherwise `mapping` remains an empty dictionary. `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is not in `mapping` except for the entry `{'a': char}` if it was added, and `c` is 98. If `chr(c)` ('b') is not in `mapping.values()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
