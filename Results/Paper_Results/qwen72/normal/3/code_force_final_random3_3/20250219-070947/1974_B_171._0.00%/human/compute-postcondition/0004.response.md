Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least one character, `char` is the first character in `encoded`, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`, and the current value of `char` is in `mapping`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `decoded` is updated to include the value of `mapping[char]`.
- The other variables (`encoded`, `char`, `mapping`) remain unchanged.
- Since `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` now contains the value associated with `char` in `mapping`.
