Output State: **`c` is 97, `mapping` dictionary contains the key-value pair `{'a': char}`, `decoded` list contains the character `'a'`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `decoded.append(chr(c))` converts the integer value of `c` (which is 97) to its corresponding character using the `chr` function, which is `'a'`. This character is then appended to the `decoded` list. The initial state of `c` and the `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged.
