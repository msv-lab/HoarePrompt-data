### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` from the distinct letters of the original string `s`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Understanding the Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process.
   - We need to create the same auxiliary string `r` from the distinct letters of the encoded string `b`.
   - Then, we replace each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `r`.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string.

4. **Issues in the Provided Program:**
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the decoding process.
   - The function is trying to create a mapping from the encoded string to the original characters, but it is not creating the auxiliary string `r` correctly.
   - The loop `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)` is trying to map each character in the encoded string to a character in the range `a` to `z`, but it is not considering the distinct characters in the encoded string and their order.
   - The mapping is being created in a way that does not reflect the symmetric replacement required for decoding.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - We should first create the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string `b`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - We should then create a mapping where each character in `b` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.
   - Finally, we should use this mapping to decode the string.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem. It attempts to map characters in a way that does not reflect the symmetric replacement required for decoding. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
