The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `set_`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `set_`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `set_` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `set_` must have at least 4 elements (since the loop runs from 1 to `len(set_) - 1`).

State: **`arr` is a list of lists, `t` is the length of `arr`, `A` is False, `set_` is a list of unique lists from `arr` that must have at least 4 elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, `i` is 3, `not_c` remains True**
