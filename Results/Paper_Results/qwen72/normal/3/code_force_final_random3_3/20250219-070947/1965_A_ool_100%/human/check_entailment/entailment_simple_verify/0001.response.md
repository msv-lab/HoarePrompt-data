### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to keep track of whether Alice or Bob wins.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes using `set(arr)` and then sorting it.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles at once. Therefore, the function returns "Alice" in this case.
   - This is correct because if the smallest pile is greater than 1, Alice can remove all stones from all piles in one move, ensuring her victory.

4. **Checking for Consecutive Pile Sizes:**
   - The program then checks if the pile sizes are consecutive. If there is a gap between any two consecutive pile sizes, the game can be won by the player whose turn it is when the gap is encountered.
   - The variable `not_c` is used to check if the pile sizes are consecutive. If they are not, `not_c` is set to `False`.
   - The variable `A` is toggled for each consecutive pile size, effectively simulating the turns of the game.
   - This logic is correct because if the pile sizes are consecutive, the game will continue until the smallest pile size is 1, and the player whose turn it is will lose.

5. **Final Check:**
   - If the pile sizes are consecutive, the final value of `A` is toggled one more time to determine the winner.
   - The function returns "Alice" if `A` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.
   - The final toggling of `A` is necessary because the number of turns taken to reach the smallest pile size of 1 is crucial. If the number of turns is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins.

### Issues:
- **Variable `n` is not used:**
  - The variable `n` (number of piles) is read but not used in the function `func_1`. This is not a correctness issue but a minor inefficiency.

- **Potential Off-by-One Error:**
  - The loop `for i in range(1, len(set_))` correctly checks the difference between consecutive pile sizes.
  - The initial value of `A` is set to `False`, which is correct because Alice goes first, and the toggling logic simulates the turns correctly.
  - The final toggling of `A` when the pile sizes are consecutive is necessary and correctly implemented.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The program correctly sets up the input for each test case. `arr` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile for the current test case.
  - The length of `arr` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and the number of stones in each pile `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) is valid.

- **Function `func_1` Execution:**
  - The function correctly handles the case where the smallest pile size is not 1 by returning "Alice".
  - The function correctly checks for consecutive pile sizes and toggles `A` for each consecutive pile size.
  - The final toggling of `A` when the pile sizes are consecutive is necessary to determine the winner correctly.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly identifies the winner based on the given problem description and logic.
- The initial check and the consecutive check are implemented correctly.
- The final toggling of `A` is necessary and correctly implemented.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
