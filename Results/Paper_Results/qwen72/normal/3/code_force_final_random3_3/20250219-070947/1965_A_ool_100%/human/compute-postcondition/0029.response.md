Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. It returns 'Alice' if the smallest number of stones in any pile is not 1, or if the differences between consecutive unique stone counts are all exactly 1. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'. **
