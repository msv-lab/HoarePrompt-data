Precondition: **arr is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. The length of arr is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, the number of piles n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and the number of stones in each pile a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are such that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
