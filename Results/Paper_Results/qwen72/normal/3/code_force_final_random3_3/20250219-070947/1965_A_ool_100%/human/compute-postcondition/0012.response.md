Output State: **`arr` is a list of lists, `t` is the length of `arr`, `A` is True, `set_` is a list of unique lists from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements, the first element of `set_` is 1, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `set_` and the first element of `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.**
