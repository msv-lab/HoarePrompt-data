### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to keep track of whether Alice or Bob wins.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes using `set(arr)` and then sorting it.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles at once. Therefore, the function returns "Alice" in this case.
   - This is correct because if the smallest pile size is greater than 1, Alice can choose `k` equal to the smallest pile size and win immediately.

4. **Checking for Consecutive Pile Sizes:**
   - The program then checks if the pile sizes are consecutive. If there is a gap between any two consecutive pile sizes, the game can be won by the player whose turn it is when the gap is encountered.
   - The variable `not_c` is used to check if the pile sizes are consecutive. If they are not, `not_c` is set to `False`.
   - The variable `A` is toggled for each consecutive pile size, effectively simulating the turns of the game.
   - This logic is correct because if the pile sizes are not consecutive, the player whose turn it is when the gap is encountered can choose `k` equal to the difference, which will leave the other player with a non-consecutive set of pile sizes, ensuring the current player's win.

5. **Final Check:**
   - If the pile sizes are consecutive, the final value of `A` is toggled one more time to determine the winner.
   - The function returns "Alice" if `A` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.
   - This final toggling is necessary because if the pile sizes are consecutive, the game essentially becomes a sequence of turns where each player can only remove 1 stone from each pile. The player who starts (Alice) will lose if the number of piles is even, and win if the number of piles is odd. The final toggling correctly simulates this.

### Issues:
- **Variable `n` is not used:**
  - The variable `n` (number of piles) is read but not used in the function `func_1`. This is not a correctness issue but a minor inefficiency. The number of piles is implicitly used in the logic of the function, so it doesn't affect the outcome.

- **Potential Off-by-One Error:**
  - The loop `for i in range(1, len(set_))` correctly checks the difference between consecutive pile sizes.
  - The initial value of `A` is set to `False`, which is correct because Alice starts the game. The toggling logic is correctly implemented to simulate the turns of the game.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly identifies the winner based on the given problem description and logic.
- The initial check and the consecutive check are implemented correctly.
- The final toggling of `A` is necessary and correctly implemented.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct.
