Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29. If `flag` is 0 and the first two elements of `s` are both '1', then `flag` is set to 1, `s[0]` is set to '-1', and `s[1]` remains '1'. If `flag` is 1 and the first element of `s` is '0', `s[0]` is set to '1'. If none of these conditions are met, the state of the variables and the list `s` remains unchanged.**
