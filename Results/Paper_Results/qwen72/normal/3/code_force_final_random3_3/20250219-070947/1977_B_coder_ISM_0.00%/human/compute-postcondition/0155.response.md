Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit at index 0 and the most significant bit at index 29. The loop has processed the list `s` from index 0 to index 28. The value of `s[i]` is now '0'. If `s[i - 1]` was '1' and `s[i]` was '-1', then `s[i - 1]` is now '-1'. If `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0 and `s[29]` is set to '1'. If `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` is '1', then `s[29]` remains '1', and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` was 0, `s[29]` remains unchanged, and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, `s[i - 1]` remains unchanged.**
