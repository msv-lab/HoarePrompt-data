Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2. If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 1, `s` is a list containing the strings '1', '1', and '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing the strings '1' or '0' followed by '0' and then another '0'.***
