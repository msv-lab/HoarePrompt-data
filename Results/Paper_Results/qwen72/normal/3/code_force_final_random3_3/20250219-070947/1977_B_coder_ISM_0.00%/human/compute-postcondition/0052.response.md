Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from position 0 to 29), `s[2]` is '-1', `flag` is 1.** 

The value of `flag` is set to 1. The values of `x`, `t`, `nalla`, `length`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged, with `s[2]` still being '-1'.
