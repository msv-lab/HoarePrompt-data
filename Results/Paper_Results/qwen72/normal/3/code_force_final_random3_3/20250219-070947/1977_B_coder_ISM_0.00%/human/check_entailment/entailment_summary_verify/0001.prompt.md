You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    24
    
    15

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    t = int(input())

        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):

            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        print(length)
        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a number `t` from the user, indicating how many times the main operation should be performed. For each iteration, it reads a positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30) and converts it into a binary string representation of length 30. It then processes this binary string to replace certain patterns: any '1' followed by another '1' is replaced with '-1' and '0', and any '-1' immediately following a '1' is replaced with '0' and '-1'. If a carry (`flag`) is set at the end of the processing and the last bit is '0', it is changed to '1'. If the carry is set and the last bit is '1', an additional '1' is appended to the list, increasing its length to 31. The function prints the initial binary string, the final length, and the processed binary string for each input `x`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x` and initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program generates a binary representation of `x` by checking each bit from 0 to 29 (since \(2^{30}\) is the upper limit for `x`).
   - It appends '1' to `s` if the bit is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true) and '0' otherwise.

3. **Adjusting the Binary Representation:**
   - The program then processes the binary representation to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag to track whether a '1' needs to be adjusted to '-1' and the next '0' to '1'.
   - If a '1' is found and the flag is set, it changes the current '1' to '-1' and sets the flag to 1.
   - If the flag is set and the current element is '0', it changes the current '0' to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the flag is set at the end of the loop and the last element is '0', it changes the last element to '1'.
   - If the flag is still set after the last element, it changes the last element to '0' and appends '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The program makes a final pass to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by checking for the pattern '1 -1' and adjusting it to '0 -1'.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the array `s` and the array itself.

### Analysis:

- **Binary Representation Generation:**
  - The binary representation is correctly generated by checking each bit from 0 to 29.
  - This ensures that the array `s` contains only '1', '0', or '-1' and that the sum of the elements in `s` multiplied by their respective powers of 2 equals `x`.

- **Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
  - The program correctly adjusts the binary representation to avoid consecutive non-zero elements.
  - The flag mechanism is used to propagate the adjustment from '1' to '-1' and the next '0' to '1'.
  - The final pass ensures that any remaining '1 -1' patterns are adjusted to '0 -1'.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem by generating a valid array `a` that meets all the given constraints. The logic for adjusting the binary representation to avoid consecutive non-zero elements is sound, and the output format is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
