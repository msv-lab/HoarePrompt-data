Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    print(*s)
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` remains an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `i` is 28, `s` is a list containing 30 or 31 strings, and `length` is 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`. The loop has iterated through the list `s` from index 1 to `length - 1`, and any occurrence of a '-1' immediately following a '1' in the list has been replaced with '0', and the '1' has been replaced with '-1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each of which is either '1', '0', or '-1', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit at index 0 and the most significant bit at index 29. The loop has processed the list `s` from index 0 to index 29. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then the value of `s[i]` is now '0' and the value of `s[i - 1]` is now '-1'. If `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0 and `s[29]` is set to '1'. If `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` is '1', then `s[29]` remains '1', and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` was 0, `s[29]` remains unchanged, and `flag` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29. The loop has processed each element in the list `s` from index 0 to 28. If any element `s[i]` was '-1' and the previous element `s[i - 1]` was '1', the current value of `s[i]` has been set to '0' and the previous value of `s[i - 1]` has been set to '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` was '0' before the loop, then `s[29]` is set to '1' and `flag` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the state of `s` and `flag` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
