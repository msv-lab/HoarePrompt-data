Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 29. `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from position 0 to 29). If the bit at position `i` in `x` is 1, the string at position `i` in `s` is '1'. Otherwise, it is '0'.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all 30 iterations, the variable `i` will be 29 (the last index in the range). The list `s` will contain 30 strings, where each string represents the bit at the corresponding position in the integer `x`. Specifically, if the bit at position `i` in `x` is 1, the string at position `i` in `s` will be '1'; otherwise, it will be '0'. The variables `x`, `t`, `nalla`, and `length` remain unchanged from their initial values.
