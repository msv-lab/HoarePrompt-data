Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 0, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from position 0 to 29). If `flag` is 1, `s[i]` is '0' and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0, the value of `s[i]` remains '1' and `flag` remains 0. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.***
