Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user to simulate a game between Bodya and Sasha. It takes no explicit parameters but reads `n` (length of the permutation), `k` (number of turns), `P_B` (Bodya's starting position), `P_S` (Sasha's starting position), `p` (a permutation of length `n`), and `a` (an array of length `n` with positive integers). The function calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their paths through the permutation and the values in the array `a`. After `k` turns, it prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. **
