Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle the case where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are the same. According to the problem description, if both players start at the same position, they will follow the same path and have the same score, resulting in a draw. However, the program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly determine a winner based on the logic used to calculate the scores.

Example of a failing case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 3
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  Draw
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will incorrectly output either "Bodya" or "Sasha" instead of "Draw" because it does not handle the case where both players start at the same position.
