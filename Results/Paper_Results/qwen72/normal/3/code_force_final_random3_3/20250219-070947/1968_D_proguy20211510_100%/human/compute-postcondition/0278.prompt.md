Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`, `curr` is the last computed value of `preb + pathb[min(len(pathb), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(pathb), k) - 1))`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `paths` is a list that must have at least one element, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `ress` is the maximum value between the original `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * k`. If `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least two elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[1]`, `ress` is the maximum value between the original `ress` and `curr`. If `k` is less than 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `paths` is a list that must have at least three elements, `pres` is `pres + paths[2] + paths[2]`, `ress` is the maximum value between the original `ress` and `pres + paths[2] * (k - 2)`, `curr` is `pres + paths[2] * (k - 2)`. If `k` is less than 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
