Output State: **`i` is 0, `paths` is a list that must have at least one element, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `ress` is the maximum value between the original `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * k`. If `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
