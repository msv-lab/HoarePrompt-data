The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `pathb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `pathb` and the value of `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `pathb`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The list `pathb` must still have at least one more element for the loop to continue, meaning `pathb` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing at least two integers, `paths` is a list containing the integers `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `ps` is now equal to the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before the loop breaks, `resb` is now the maximum of 0 and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is now equal to `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 1, `curr` is `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`**
