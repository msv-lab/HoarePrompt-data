Output State: **`vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `min(len(paths) - 1, k - 1)`, `curr` is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index where the loop breaks, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]`, `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1]`, ..., up to the point where the loop breaks, `paths` is a list containing the elements `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, and `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]` has been appended to `paths`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.
- All other variables (`vis`, `i`, `pres`, `ress`, `curr`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`) remain unchanged.
- The condition to break out of the loop (`if vis[ps - 1] is 1`) is still in effect, but whether it will break depends on the new value of `ps`.
