Output State: **`i` is 0, `paths` must have at least one element. If `k` is less than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pres += paths[i]` updates the value of `pres` by adding the value of `paths[0]` to it, since `i` is 0. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, and `curr` is still `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, but now `pres` has the new value.
