The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `pathb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `pathb` and the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `pathb` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `pathb` must have at least 3 elements to ensure that the loop condition `i < len(pathb)` is still satisfied.

State: **`pathb` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0] + pathb[1]`, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * k`. If `k` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
