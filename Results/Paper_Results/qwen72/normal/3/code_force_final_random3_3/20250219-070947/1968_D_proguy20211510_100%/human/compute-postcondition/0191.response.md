Postcondition: ***`i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `min(len(paths) - 1, k - 1)`, `curr` is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`, and `resb` is less than or equal to `ress` if the condition `ress > resb` is true. If the condition `ress > resb` is false, `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`.***
