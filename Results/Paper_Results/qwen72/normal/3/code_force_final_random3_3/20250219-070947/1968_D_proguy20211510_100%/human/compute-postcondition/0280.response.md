Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is defined as `min(len(paths), k) - 1`.
   - `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`.
   - `curr` is defined as `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`.
   - `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop.
   - `resb` is greater than `ress`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Bodya')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'Bodya'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `i`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string `'Bodya'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **Bodya**
