Output State: **`i` is 2, `paths` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `pres` is `pres + paths[0] + paths[1]`, `ress` is the maximum of its previous value and `pres + paths[0] + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] + paths[1] * (k - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
