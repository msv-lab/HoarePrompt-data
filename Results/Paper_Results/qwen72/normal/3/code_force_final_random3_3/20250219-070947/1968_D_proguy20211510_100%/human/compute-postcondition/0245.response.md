Output State: **`i` is 0, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element, `preb` is equal to `preb + pathb[0]`, if `k` is less than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `resb` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr`.**

Explanation:
- `resb` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr`.
- `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`.
- All other variables (`i`, `pathb`, `preb`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement (`k` is less than 1) is still valid.
