Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps` are integers, `p` is a list of integers where each integer is a positive integer provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing at least two integers, `paths` is a list containing the integers `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`, and so on until the loop breaks, `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `ps` is now equal to the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before the loop breaks, `resb` is now the maximum of 0 and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is now equal to `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 1, `curr` is `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
