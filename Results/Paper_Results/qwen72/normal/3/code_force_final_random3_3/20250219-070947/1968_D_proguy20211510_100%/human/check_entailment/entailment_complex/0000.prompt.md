First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should take parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns in the game, `P_B` and `P_S` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. `p` is a permutation of length `n` containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `a` is an array of length `n` containing positive integers, each between 1 and 10^9.
def func():
    YES, NO = 'YES', 'NO'
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    alpha = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
        
        n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pathb, paths = [], []
        
        vis = [0] * n
        
        vis[pb - 1] = 1
        
        while True:
            pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
            pb = p[pb - 1]
            if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
                break
        
        vis = [0] * n
        
        vis[ps - 1] = 1
        
        while True:
            paths.append(a[ps - 1])
            ps = p[ps - 1]
            if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
                break
        
        resb, ress = 0, 0
        
        preb, pres = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(len(pathb)):
            if k < i + 1:
                break
            curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
            preb += pathb[i]
            resb = max(resb, curr)
        
        for i in range(len(paths)):
            if k < i + 1:
                break
            curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
            pres += paths[i]
            ress = max(ress, curr)
        
        if resb > ress:
            print('Bodya')
        elif ress > resb:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, or it broke early if `k` was less than the length of `paths` at any point. `i` is equal to the length of `paths` minus 1, or the value of `i` when the loop broke. `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths` up to the point where the loop completed or broke. `curr` is the final value of `pres + paths[-1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, or the value calculated up to the point where the loop broke. `ress` is the maximum value encountered in the expression `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to the length of `paths` minus 1, or the maximum value calculated up to the point where the loop broke. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `resb` is greater than `ress`. Otherwise, `ress` is greater than or equal to `resb`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to simulate a game between Bodya and Sasha. It takes no explicit parameters but reads `n` (length of the permutation), `k` (number of turns), `P_B` (Bodya's starting position), `P_S` (Sasha's starting position), `p` (a permutation of length `n`), and `a` (an array of length `n` with positive integers). The function calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their paths through the permutation and the values in the array `a`. After `k` turns, it prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.
