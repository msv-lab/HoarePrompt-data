Postcondition: **`vis` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `p[pb - 1] - 1` which is 1, `i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `min(len(paths) - 1, k - 1)`, `curr` is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]` and `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list. If the element at index `pb - 1` in `vis` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
