Output State: **`pathb` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of `pathb`, `i`, `curr`, `preb`, and `resb` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
