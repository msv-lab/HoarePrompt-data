Output State: **`i` is 2, `paths` is a list that must have at least three elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[2] * (k - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[2]`, `ress` is the maximum value between the original `ress` and `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The values of `i`, `paths`, `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` remain unchanged.
- The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
