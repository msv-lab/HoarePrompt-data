Postcondition: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop, and `resb` is less than `ress`.**
