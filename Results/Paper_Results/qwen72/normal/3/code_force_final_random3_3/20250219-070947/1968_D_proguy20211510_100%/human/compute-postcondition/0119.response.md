Output State: **`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is now `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth input value converted to an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]`, `a[pb - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except the element at index `p[pb - 1] - 1` is 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the element at index `pb - 1` in the `vis` list is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
