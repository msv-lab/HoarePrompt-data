Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k) - 1`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for all `j` from 0 to `min(len(paths) - 1, k - 1)`, `curr` is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1] * (k - (min(len(paths), k) - 1))`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer. If `resb` > `ress`, then `resb` is greater than `ress`. Otherwise, `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are converted from strings to integers using the `int()` function.
- The values of `i`, `pres`, `ress`, and `curr` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- The condition comparing `resb` and `ress` remains the same, as it was not directly impacted by the code.
