Output State: **`n` is the first input value converted to an integer, `k` is the second input value converted to an integer, `pb` is the final index in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `ps` is the fourth input value converted to an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `pathb` is a list containing the integers from `a` at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation:
- The code `vis = [0] * n` initializes `vis` as a list of `n` zeros.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state of `vis` being a list of `n` zeros, except for the elements at the indices visited in the sequence defined by `p` starting from `pb` and stopping when a previously visited index is encountered, is no longer valid because `vis` is now fully reset to a list of `n` zeros.
