Output State: **`pathb` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * k`. If `k` is less than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `curr`.
- The value of `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, which simplifies to `preb + pathb[0] * k`.
- The value of `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`.
- The values of `pathb` and `i` remain unchanged.
- If `k` is less than 1, the `break` statement would have been executed, so the output state includes this condition.
