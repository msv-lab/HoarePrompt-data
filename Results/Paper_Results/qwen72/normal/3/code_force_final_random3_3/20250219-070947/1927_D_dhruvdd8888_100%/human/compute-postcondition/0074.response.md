The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a tuple of two integers `(l, r)` such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The list `a` should have a length of 2 to 2 * 10^5, and each element `a_i` should be an integer between 1 and 10^6. The number of queries `q` should be a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5.

The function processes each query `(l, r)` and returns a list of results. Each result corresponds to the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l-1:r]` (i.e., from index `l-1` to `r-1` inclusive).
