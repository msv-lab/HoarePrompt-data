Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `num` is equal to the element at index 1 of the list `nums`. If `nums[1]` is not equal to `nums[0]`, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(2, 2, num)`, and `s` is 2. Otherwise, if `nums[1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `arr` has a new element appended: a tuple `(1, 2, num)`, and `s` is 2.***
