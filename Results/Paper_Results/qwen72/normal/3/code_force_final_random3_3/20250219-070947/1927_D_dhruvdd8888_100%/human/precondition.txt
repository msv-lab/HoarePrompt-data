t is an integer where 1 \le t \le 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 \le a_i \le 10^6, representing the elements of the array. q is an integer where 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 \le l < r \le n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
