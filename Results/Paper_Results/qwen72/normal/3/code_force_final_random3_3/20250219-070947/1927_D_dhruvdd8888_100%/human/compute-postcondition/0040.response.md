Postcondition: **`_` is controlled by `range(int(input()))`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `s` is less than or equal to `l`, `e` is less than `r`, and the current value of `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`.**
