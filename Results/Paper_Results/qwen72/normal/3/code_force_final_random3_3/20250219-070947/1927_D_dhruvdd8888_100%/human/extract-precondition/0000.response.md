Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and a list of queries `q` where each query is a tuple of two integers `(l, r)` such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The list `a` should have a length of 2 to 2 * 10^5, and each element `a_i` should be an integer between 1 and 10^6. The number of queries `q` should be a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to include the necessary parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(a, n, queries):
```

With the updated function definition, the precondition is:

Precondition: **a is a list of integers of length n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), where each element a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). queries is a list of q tuples (1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5), each containing two integers l and r (1 <= l < r <= n).**
