Postcondition: **`_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. If `s == 1` or `s > r`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `s <= l`, the postcondition also remains unchanged.**
