Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `_` is 1.
2. `int(input())` must be greater than 1. This means the user input is an integer greater than 1.
3. `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split. This implies that the user input is a string that can be split into two integers, `l` and `r`.
4. `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
5. `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
6. The third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is assigned to `_`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s - 1, s)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **User Input:**
   - The user inputs a string that is split into two integers, `l` and `r`.
   - Both `l` and `r` are integers, and `l` must be greater than 1.

2. **Tuple Insertion Index (`eli`):**
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - This means `arr` is a sorted list of tuples, and `eli` is the position where `(l, 0, 0)` fits in that sorted order.

3. **Tuple at Index `min(eli, LA)`:**
   - `LA` is the length of `arr`.
   - `min(eli, LA)` ensures that the index is within the bounds of `arr`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

4. **Assignment to `_`:**
   - The third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is assigned to `_`.
   - This does not affect the print statement directly but changes the value of `_`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(s - 1, s)` will print the value of `s - 1` and `s`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted, `s` is the first element of the tuple that is either at `eli` or the last element of `arr` if `eli` is out of bounds.
- The exact value of `s` depends on the contents of `arr` and the value of `l` from the user input.
- The print statement will output `s - 1` and `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr, and eli is the index where the tuple (l, 0, 0) would be inserted in arr to maintain sorted order)**
