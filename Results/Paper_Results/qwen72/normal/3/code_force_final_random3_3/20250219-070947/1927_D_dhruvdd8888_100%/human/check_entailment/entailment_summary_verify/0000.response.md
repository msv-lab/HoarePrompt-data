### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate in identifying several issues with the program. Let's break down the problems and the reasoning behind them:

1. **Input Handling Issue**:
   - The function `func_1` reads input using `sys.stdin.readline` and does not reset its state between test cases. This means that the input for the second test case and subsequent test cases will be read incorrectly, leading to potential errors in processing and results.

2. **Logic Flaw in Query Handling**:
   - The program uses a binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the start of a segment where the elements are different. However, the logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]` is flawed.
   - Specifically, the program does not correctly handle cases where the segment contains only one unique element or when the segment is entirely within a range of identical elements.
   - The conditions for printing `(-1, -1)` and the pairs `(i, j)` are not robust enough to cover all possible edge cases.

### Specific Issues in the Code

1. **State Reset**:
   - The list `arr` and other variables (`s`, `e`, `num`) are not reset between test cases. This can lead to incorrect results for subsequent test cases because the state from the previous test case will interfere with the current one.

2. **Query Logic**:
   - The logic for finding the indices `i` and `j` is not comprehensive. For example, the condition `if s > l` and `elif e >= r` do not cover all possible scenarios where a pair of different elements might exist or not.
   - The program should correctly identify the segments within the query range and check for the presence of different elements.

### Example of Failure

Consider the input provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
2
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
6
30 20 20 10 10 20
5
1 2
2 3
2 4
2 6
3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3

2 1
-1 -1
4 2
4 6
5 3
```

**Actual Output:**
- The program will likely produce incorrect results for the second test case because the state of `arr` and other variables is not reset between test cases.
- For the first test case, the program might produce the correct output, but for the second test case, it will fail due to the incorrect state.

### Corrected Approach

To correct the program, we need to:
1. Reset the state of `arr` and other variables at the beginning of each test case.
2. Improve the logic for handling queries to ensure it correctly identifies pairs of different elements within the given range.

### Final Evaluation

Given the issues identified and the reasoning provided, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the state reset issue and the flawed logic in query handling.

Final: **False**
