Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive elements in `nums` that are equal, each tuple in the form `(1 + s, i, num)` where `s` is the start index of the range and `i` is the end index of the range. `s` is `N`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N or e < l:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is controlled by `range(int(input()))`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. If `s` > `l`, then `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`, or `s` is not equal to 1 and is less than or equal to `r`. If `s` â‰¤ `l`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, or `e` is less than `r` and if `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, the current value of `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`. If `e` is greater than or equal to `N`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and greater than or equal to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is assigned to `_`. If `s > l`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `s <= l`, the postcondition also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split, `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. If `s > l`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `s <= l`, the postcondition also remains unchanged. If `s == 1` or `s > r`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `e >= r`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `e < r` and `e < N` or `e < l`, the postcondition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
