To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is the third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - If `s > l`, the postcondition remains unchanged.
   - If `s <= l`, the postcondition also remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
   - The values `-1` and `-1` are constants and do not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `-1, -1` regardless of the values of `arr`, `eli`, `LA`, `s`, `e`, `l`, or `r`.

Output: **-1, -1**
