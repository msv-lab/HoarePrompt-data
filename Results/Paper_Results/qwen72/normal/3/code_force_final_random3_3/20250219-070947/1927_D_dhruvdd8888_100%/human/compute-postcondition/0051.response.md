Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 1. This implies that the user input is an integer greater than 1.
   - `l` and `r` are the integers from the input split. This means the user input is split into two integers, `l` and `r`.
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. This implies that `arr` is a sorted list of tuples.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - The third element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` is assigned to `_`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement will always print the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `_`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, or `arr`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print `-1` and `-1`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **-1, -1**
