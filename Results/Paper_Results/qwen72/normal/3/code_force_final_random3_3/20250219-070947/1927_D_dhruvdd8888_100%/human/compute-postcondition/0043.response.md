Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **`_` is controlled by `range(int(input()))`**:
   - This means that the loop variable `_` will iterate over a range of values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0, ensuring that the loop runs at least once.

2. **`l` and `r` are the integers from the input split**:
   - This implies that `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting a user input. For example, if the user inputs "3 5", then `l` will be 3 and `r` will be 5.

3. **`eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order**:
   - `arr` is a list of tuples, and `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to keep `arr` sorted. This is typically done using a binary search or similar method.

4. **`s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`**:
   - `LA` is the length of the list `arr`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

5. **`s` is less than or equal to `l`**:
   - This condition ensures that `s` is less than or equal to the value of `l`.

6. **`e` is less than `r`**:
   - This condition ensures that `e` is less than the value of `r`.

7. **The condition `e < N or e < l` is false**:
   - This means that `e` is not less than `N` and `e` is not less than `l`.
   - Therefore, `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and `e` is greater than or equal to `l`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:
```
print(-1, -1)
```

The `print` statement is hardcoded to print the values `-1` and `-1`, regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, `N`, or `LA`.

Output: **-1, -1**
