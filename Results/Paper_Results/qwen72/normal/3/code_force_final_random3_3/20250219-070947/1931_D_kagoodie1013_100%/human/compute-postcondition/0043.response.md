Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 3, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 2, `arr` must contain at least three elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_key = num % x, num % y` updates the value of `current_key` to a tuple of the results of `num % x` and `num % y`.
- The value of `num` is the third element of `arr`.
- The values of `x` and `y` are taken from the second tuple in `test_cases`.
- The values of `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated as `-num % x` and `num % y` respectively.
- The dictionary `residue_map` still contains `current_key` mapped to 2, but `current_key` itself has been updated.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
