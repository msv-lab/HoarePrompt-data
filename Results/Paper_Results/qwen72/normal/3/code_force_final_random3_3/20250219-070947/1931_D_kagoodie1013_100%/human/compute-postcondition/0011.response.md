Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` and the value 1, `arr` must have at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`.
- The value of `r_y` is updated to `num % y`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `(n, x, y, arr)`, `count`, `residue_map`, `arr`, and `num` remain unchanged.
- `current_key` is still a tuple containing the values `num % x` and `num % y`.
