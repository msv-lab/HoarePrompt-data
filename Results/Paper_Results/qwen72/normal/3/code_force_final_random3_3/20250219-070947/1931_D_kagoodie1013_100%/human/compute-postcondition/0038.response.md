Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 1, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 2, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `residue_map[current_key]` by incrementing it by 1. Initially, `residue_map[current_key]` was 1, so after the execution, it becomes 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
