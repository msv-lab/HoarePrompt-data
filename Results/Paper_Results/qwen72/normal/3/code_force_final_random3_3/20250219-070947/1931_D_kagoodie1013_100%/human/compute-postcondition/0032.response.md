The code snippet updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `current_key` tuple. The `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`. Since `residue_map` was initially an empty dictionary, the `get` method will return `0` for the `current_key`, and then `1` will be assigned to `residue_map[current_key]`.

Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 1, `arr` must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.**
