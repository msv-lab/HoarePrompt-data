Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the total number of pairs in `arr` that have the same residues as previously seen elements, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` and each value is the count of how many times that tuple has been encountered, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x` for the last element, `r_y` is `num % y` for the last element, and `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element.** 

The `results` list now includes the value of `count` as its last element. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
