Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1` and is now updated to `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1 + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` and the value 2, `arr` must have at least three elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- `count` was initially set to `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`.
- The code `count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` increments `count` by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
- Since `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` returns 2 (as `residue_map` contains the key `current_key` with the value 2), `count` is now `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1 + 2`, which simplifies to `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 3`.
- All other variables and their initial states remain unchanged.
