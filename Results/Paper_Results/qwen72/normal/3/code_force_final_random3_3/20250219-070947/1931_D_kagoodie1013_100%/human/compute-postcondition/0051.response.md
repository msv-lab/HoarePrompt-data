Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` and `current_key` are not relevant for the loop to start.**

Explanation:
- `r_x` is assigned the value of `-num % x`. This means `r_x` is the result of the modulo operation of the negative of `num` with `x`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
