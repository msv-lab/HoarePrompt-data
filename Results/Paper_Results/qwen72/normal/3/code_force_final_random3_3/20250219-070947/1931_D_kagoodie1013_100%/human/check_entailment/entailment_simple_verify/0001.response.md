Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient and appropriate for the given input format.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, parsing the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the array `arr` from the list of strings. This is done correctly and efficiently.

2. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by storing them in a list `test_cases` and processing each one in the `func_1` function. This ensures that each test case is processed independently.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - For each element in the array, the program calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
     - `r_x = -num % x` is used to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` is used to check if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - These calculations are correct. The expression `-num % x` computes the residue of `-num` modulo `x`, which is equivalent to `x - (num % x)` when `num % x` is non-zero. This ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` if `a_i % x` and `a_j % x` are the same.
   - Similarly, `num % y` computes the residue of `num` modulo `y`, which ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` if `a_i % y` and `a_j % y` are the same.

4. **Pair Counting**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs with specific residues.
   - For each element `num`, it checks if there is already a pair in the dictionary that satisfies the conditions by looking up the key `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - It then updates the dictionary with the current element's residues.
   - This approach is correct and efficient, as it allows the program to count pairs in O(n) time complexity for each test case.

5. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them one per line, which matches the required output format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `n` is small or large, and when `x` and `y` are large.
   - It also handles the case where `x` and `y` are equal, and the case where the array `arr` contains repeated elements.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a dictionary to store and look up residues, which provides an efficient way to count pairs in O(n) time complexity for each test case.
   - The overall time complexity is O(t * n), where `t` is the number of test cases and `n` is the length of the array for each test case, which is within the problem's constraints.

8. **State Management**:
   - The `residue_map` dictionary is reset to an empty dictionary after each test case, ensuring that the results for each test case are independent and correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Final: **True**
