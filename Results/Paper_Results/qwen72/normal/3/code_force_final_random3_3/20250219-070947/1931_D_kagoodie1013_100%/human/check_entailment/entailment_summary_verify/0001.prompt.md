You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (num % x, num % y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each tuple to count how many pairs of integers in `a` satisfy the condition that the negative residue of the first integer modulo `x` and the positive residue of the second integer modulo `y` are the same. The function returns a list `results` containing the count for each tuple in `test_cases`. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, and any internal state (like the `residue_map` dictionary) is reset after processing each tuple.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, parsing the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the array `arr` from the list of strings.
   - This approach is efficient and appropriate for the given input format.

2. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by storing them in a list `test_cases` and processing each one in the `func_1` function.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - For each element in the array, the program calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
     - `r_x = -num % x` is used to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` is used to check if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - These residues are used as keys in a dictionary `residue_map` to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

4. **Pair Counting**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs with specific residues.
   - For each element `num`, it checks if there is already a pair in the dictionary that satisfies the conditions by looking up the key `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - It then updates the dictionary with the current element's residues.

5. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them one per line, which matches the required output format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `n` is small or large, and when `x` and `y` are large.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a dictionary to store and look up residues, which provides an efficient way to count pairs in O(n) time complexity for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.
