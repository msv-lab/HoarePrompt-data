Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 1`. If the count of the value `j + 1` in the list `cards` is 0, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.***
