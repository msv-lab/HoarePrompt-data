The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `n - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`, which means `n` must be at least 1. However, since the state already specifies that `n` is at least 3, this condition is already met. The variable `j` needs to be adjusted to the starting value of the loop, which is `n - 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop, `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 1`**
