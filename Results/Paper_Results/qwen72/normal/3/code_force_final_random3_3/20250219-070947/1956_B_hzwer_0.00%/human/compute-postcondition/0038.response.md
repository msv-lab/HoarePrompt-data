Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, and `j` is `n - 1`. If the count of the value `j + 1` in the list `cards` is exactly 1, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If the count of the value `j + 1` in the list `cards` is greater than 1, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.***
