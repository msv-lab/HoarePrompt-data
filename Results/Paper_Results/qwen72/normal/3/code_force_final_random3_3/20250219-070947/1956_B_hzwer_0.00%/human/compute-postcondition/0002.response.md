Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0. `n` is an input integer. `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user. The total number of test cases `t` is given, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list.**
