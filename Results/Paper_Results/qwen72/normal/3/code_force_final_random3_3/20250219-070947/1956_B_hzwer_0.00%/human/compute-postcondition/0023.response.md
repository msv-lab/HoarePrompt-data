Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]`, `dp[n - 2][0]`, and `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` which are 0, `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `j` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- Given `i` is `n - 3` and `j` is `n - 3`, `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is set to `dp[n - 2][n - 3]`.
- Since `dp[n - 2][n - 3]` was initially 0, `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is now 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
