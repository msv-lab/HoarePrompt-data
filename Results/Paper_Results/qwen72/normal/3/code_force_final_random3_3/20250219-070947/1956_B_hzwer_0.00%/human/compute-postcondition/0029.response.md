The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 3` down to `0` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, and `n` must still be at least 3 to ensure the loop's condition `i >= 0` is met.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 4`, and `j` is 0. The `dp` table is filled such that for each `j` from `n - 1` down to 0, the value `dp[i][j]` is set based on the count of the integer `j + 1` in the `cards` list. If `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears at least twice, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
