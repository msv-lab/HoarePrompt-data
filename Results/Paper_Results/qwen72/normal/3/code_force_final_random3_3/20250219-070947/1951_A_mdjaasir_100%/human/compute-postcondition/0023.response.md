Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`. If `count` is 0, the program follows the if part. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, or if `count` is exactly 2 and the first '1' in `a` is not immediately followed by another '1', the program also follows the if part. Otherwise, if `count` is exactly 2 and the second '1' in `a` is immediately after the first '1', or if `count` is greater than 0 and either less than or equal to 2 or odd but not equal to 2, the program follows the else part.**
