Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, `count` is greater than 0, and `count` is exactly 2. The first '1' in `a` is not immediately followed by another '1'.**
