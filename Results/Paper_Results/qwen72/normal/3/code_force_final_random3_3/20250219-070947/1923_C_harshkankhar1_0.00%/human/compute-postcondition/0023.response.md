Output State: **`q` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and either 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `q`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` is evaluated.
- If the condition is true, 'NO' is printed.
- If the condition is false, 'YES' is printed.
- The output state includes the unchanged values of `q`, `x`, and `y`, and the result of the print statement based on the evaluated condition.
