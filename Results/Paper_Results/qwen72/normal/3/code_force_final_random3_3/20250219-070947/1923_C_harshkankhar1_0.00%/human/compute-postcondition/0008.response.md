Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `b[1]` which is `x`, and `b[2]` is `2 * x`, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x` updates the value of `b[2]` (since `i` is 2) to be the sum of `b[1]` and `x`.
- `b[1]` is `x` (as per the initial state).
- Therefore, `b[2]` becomes `x + x`, which is `2 * x`.
- The value of `x` depends on the value of `a[2]`: if `a[2]` is greater than 1, `x` is 1; otherwise, `x` is 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
