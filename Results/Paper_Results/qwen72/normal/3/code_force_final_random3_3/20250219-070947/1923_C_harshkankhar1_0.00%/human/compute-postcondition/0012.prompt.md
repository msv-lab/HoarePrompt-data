Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer, and `q` queries. For each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i` are provided, where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. The function should validate that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5`, and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed `3 * 10^5`. `n` and `q` are now input integers. `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the integers provided by the input. `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
    b[i] = b[i - 1] + x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `b[1]` which is `x`, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `b[1]` which is `x`, and `b[2]` is `2 * x`, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `b[1]` which is `x`, `b[2]` is `2 * x`, `b[3]` is `3 * x`, `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
