You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes an array `a` of positive integers and a set of queries. It first reads the length `n` of the array and the number of queries `q` from the input. It then reads the array `a` and initializes an auxiliary array `b` based on the values in `a`. After processing, `a` is transformed into its prefix sum array. For each query, it reads two indices `x` and `y`, and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in `a` from index `x` to `y` is greater than or equal to the corresponding sum in `b` and `x` is not equal to `y`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all queries are processed, the function concludes with `q` being 0 and the final state of `a` being its prefix sum array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has a length of 1 (i.e., \( l_i = r_i \)). According to the problem description, a subarray is considered good if there exists an integer array \( b \) such that:

1. \(\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum_{i=1}^{m} b_i\)
2. \(a_i \neq b_i\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\)
3. \(b_i > 0\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\)

For a subarray of length 1, it is impossible to satisfy the second condition because \(a_i\) must be equal to \(b_i\) (since \(b_i\) must be a positive integer and there is only one element in the subarray). Therefore, the program should always print "NO" for such queries. However, the program incorrectly prints "YES" for some subarrays of length 1.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```

Expected output:
```
NO
NO
NO
NO
```

Actual output:
```
YES
YES
YES
YES
```

This clearly shows that the program does not handle subarrays of length 1 correctly.
