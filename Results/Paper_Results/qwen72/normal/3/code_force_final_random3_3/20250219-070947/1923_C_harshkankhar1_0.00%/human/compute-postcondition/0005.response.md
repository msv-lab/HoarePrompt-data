Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `b[1]` which is `x`, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b[i]` (which is `b[1]` since `i` is 1) is updated to `b[i - 1] + x` (which is `b[0] + x`).
- Since `b` is initially a list of zeros, `b[0]` is 0.
- Therefore, `b[1]` becomes `0 + x`, which is simply `x`.
- The value of `x` remains 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` remains 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
