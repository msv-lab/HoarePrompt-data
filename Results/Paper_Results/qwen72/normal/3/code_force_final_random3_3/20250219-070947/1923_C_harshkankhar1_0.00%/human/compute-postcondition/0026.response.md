Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes an array `a` of positive integers and a set of queries. It first reads the length `n` of the array and the number of queries `q` from the input. It then reads the array `a` and initializes an auxiliary array `b` based on the values in `a`. After processing, `a` is transformed into its prefix sum array. For each query, it reads two indices `x` and `y`, and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in `a` from index `x` to `y` is greater than or equal to the corresponding sum in `b` and `x` is not equal to `y`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all queries are processed, the function concludes with `q` being 0 and the final state of `a` being its prefix sum array. **
