Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `b[1]` which is `x`, and `b[2]` is `2 * x`, `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2` updates the value of `x` based on the condition `a[i] > 1`.
- Since `i` is 3, the condition checks `a[3] > 1`.
- If `a[3]` is greater than 1, `x` is set to 1.
- If `a[3]` is not greater than 1, `x` is set to 2.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The previous state of `b[1]` and `b[2]` being `x` and `2 * x` respectively, is still valid, but `x` has been updated based on the new condition.
