The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `b[1]` which is `x`, and `b[2]` is `2 * x`, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2**
