### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good."
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another subarray `b` such that:
     - The sum of elements in `c` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
     - No element in `c` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases, the length of the array `c`, the number of queries, and the elements of `c`.

3. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program creates an array `b` where each element is either 1 or 2, depending on the value of the corresponding element in `a`.
   - This is done to ensure that `b[i]` is always different from `a[i]` and positive.
   - The array `a` is then converted to a prefix sum array using `accumulate`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is greater than or equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.
   - If the sum of `c[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of `b[l_i, r_i]`, or if the subarray has only one element (`x == y`), the subarray is not "good" and the program prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, the program prints "YES".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element (`x == y`), which cannot be "good" because there is no way to form a different positive array `b` with the same sum.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the sum of `c[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of `b[l_i, r_i]`, which would violate the condition that the sums must be equal.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results in the correct format, with "YES" or "NO" for each query.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the given constraints and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
