Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input, and `s` is the next line in the input. If `x < k - 1`, the variables retain their initial values. If `x == k - 1`, the variables also retain their initial values. If `x > k - 1`, `z` is calculated as `k - 2 + (x - k + 3) * (1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1))`, and `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0. In this case, if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, `i` is set to `x - k + 3 - 1`. If `a` is less than `z`, `i` also remains `x - k + 3 - 1`.***
