Output State: **`z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`, `x` is already greater than or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is 1, `x - k + 3` is greater than 1**

The value of `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`. The other conditions remain unchanged: `x` is still greater than or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1`, `i` remains 1, and `x - k + 3` is still greater than 1.
