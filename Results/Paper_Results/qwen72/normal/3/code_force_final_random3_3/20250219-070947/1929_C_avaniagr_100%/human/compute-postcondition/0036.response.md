The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input.
   - `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input.
   - `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are not used in the `print` statement.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - Since the `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions in the initial state, it will always print the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
