Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input, and `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input. If `a` >= `x` + 1, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` also remain unchanged.***
