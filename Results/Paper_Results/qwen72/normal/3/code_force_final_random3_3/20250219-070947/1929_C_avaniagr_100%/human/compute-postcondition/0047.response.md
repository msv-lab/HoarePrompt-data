Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input and must be at least `k - 3`, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input, `z` is the result of the expression `z + z // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x - k + 3` times, starting with `z = k - 2`, `i` is `x - k + 2`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to the current value of `z`.**
