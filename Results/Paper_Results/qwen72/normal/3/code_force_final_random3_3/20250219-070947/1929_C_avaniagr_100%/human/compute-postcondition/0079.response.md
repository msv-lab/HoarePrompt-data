Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, where the first line specifies the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9). It then determines whether a certain condition involving `k`, `x`, and `a` is met and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. Specifically, if `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 2`. If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` starting from `k - 2` and updates it by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` iterations, then checks if `a >= z`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each case based on these conditions. **
