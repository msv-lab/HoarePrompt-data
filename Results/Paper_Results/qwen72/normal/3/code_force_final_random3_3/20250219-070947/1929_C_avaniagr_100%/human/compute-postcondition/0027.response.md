Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `z` is updated to `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`.
2. `x` is already greater than or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1`.
3. `i` is `x - k + 3`.
4. `x - k + 3` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
5. `a` is less than `z`.

### Analysis:
- Since `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1`, it means `x` is strictly greater than `k - 1`.
- The variable `i` is defined as `x - k + 3`. Given that `x` is strictly greater than `k - 1`, `i` will be a positive integer.
- The update to `z` is `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`. This means `z` is increased by a value that depends on `i` and `z`.
- `a` is less than `z`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
The code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of `z`, `x`, `k`, `i`, and `a` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to print the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
