Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input, `z` is `k - 2`.** 

In natural language: The value of `z` is now `k - 2`, while the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.
