Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input, and `s` is the next line in the input. If `a` >= `x` + 2, the program retains these values without any changes. Otherwise, the program also retains these values without any changes.***
