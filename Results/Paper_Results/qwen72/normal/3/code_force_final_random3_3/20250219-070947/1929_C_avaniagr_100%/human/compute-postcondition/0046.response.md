Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input and must be at least `k - 3`, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input, `z` is the result of the expression `z + z // (k - 1) + 1` repeated `x - k + 3` times, starting with `z = k - 2`, `i` is `x - k + 2`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 1000.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged and is the first integer from the third line of the input.
- The value of `x` must be at least `k - 3` for the loop to execute at least once. The loop will execute `x - k + 3` times in total.
- The value of `a` remains unchanged and is the third integer from the third line of the input.
- The value of `z` is updated in each iteration of the loop. The update rule is `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`, starting from `z = k - 2`. This update is applied `x - k + 3` times.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and after all iterations, it will be `x - k + 2`.
