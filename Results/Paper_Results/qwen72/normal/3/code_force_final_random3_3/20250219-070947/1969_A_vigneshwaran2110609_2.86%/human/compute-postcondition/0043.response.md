Output State: **`i` is `x`, `n` must be greater than `x`, `x` is an integer provided by the user, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is True if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was met for any `i` in the range from 0 to `x`. If the condition was never met, `flag` remains unchanged, and the program prints 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`.
- The initial state variables `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The initial state condition for `flag` remains the same, as the code snippet does not affect the value of `flag`.
- The program does not print anything in this snippet, so the condition to print 3 is not triggered here.
