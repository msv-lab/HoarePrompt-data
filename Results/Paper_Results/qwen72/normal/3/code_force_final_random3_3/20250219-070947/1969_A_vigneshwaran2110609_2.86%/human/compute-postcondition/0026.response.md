Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is True.** 

The value of `flag` has been set to True because the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is true for the current value of `i` which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
