Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is not modified unless the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met for any `i` in the range from 0 to `x`. The current value of `i` is 0, and the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is true.**
