Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If the element at the index `l[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `flag`.***
