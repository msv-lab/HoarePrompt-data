Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` for `i` = 0, then `flag` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.***
