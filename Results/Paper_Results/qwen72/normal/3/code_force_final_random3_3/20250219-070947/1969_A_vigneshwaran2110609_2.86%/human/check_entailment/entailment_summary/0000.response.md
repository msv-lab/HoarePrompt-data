Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, the program prints `2` because inviting both of these friends will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. If no such pair is found, the program prints `3` because it assumes that the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.

However, this logic is flawed. The program only checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, which means it is looking for a specific type of cycle (a 2-cycle or a pair of friends who are each other's best friends). This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of invitations needed for all possible scenarios.

For example, consider the test case:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
Here, no friend is the best friend of another friend in the list, so the program will print `3`. However, the correct answer is `2` because Monocarp can invite any two friends, and both will come since their best friends are not in the list.

Another example:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
The program will print `3`, but the correct answer is `3` only because there is no 2-cycle. However, the program does not correctly handle more complex cycles or chains of best friends.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the smallest cycle or chain of friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The correct approach would involve detecting cycles and chains in the list of best friends and then determining the minimum number of invitations required.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
