The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the integer value 2. The initial state provides information about other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, `l`, `flag`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the code snippet is solely determined by the value explicitly printed in the statement.

Output: **2**
