Output State: **`i` is `x`, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is not modified unless the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met for any `i` in the range from 0 to `x`. If the condition is met, `flag` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If the condition is never met, the program prints 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`.
- The values of `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The variable `flag` is not modified unless the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met for any `i` in the range from 0 to `x`.
- If the condition is met, `flag` is set to True, and the loop breaks.
- If the condition is never met, the program prints 3.
- The initial state of `flag` is not specified, but it is only modified if the condition is met.
