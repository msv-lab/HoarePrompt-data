Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times to process each test case. This is appropriate for the problem description.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
   - Otherwise, it prints the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price).

4. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
   - Otherwise, it prints the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 (odd) and the promotion price is not used.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 2 (even) and the promotion price is used if it is cheaper.

6. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is correct. It considers both the regular and promotion prices and chooses the cheaper option for pairs of yogurts.
   - For odd `n`, it ensures that the last yogurt is bought at the regular price if the promotion price is not cheaper for a pair.
   - For even `n`, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price if it is cheaper.

However, there is a subtle issue in the logic for odd `n`:
   - When `n` is odd, the program should always consider the cost of buying `n-1` yogurts in pairs and the last yogurt at the regular price, regardless of whether `2 * a < b` or not. This is because the last yogurt cannot be part of a pair, and thus must be bought at the regular price.

Let's break down the logic for odd `n`:
   - The correct cost for odd `n` should always be `n // 2 * b + a`, because `n // 2` pairs can be bought at the promotion price, and the remaining one yogurt must be bought at the regular price.

The program's current logic for odd `n` is:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`.

This is incorrect because even if `2 * a < b`, the last yogurt must still be bought at the regular price. Therefore, the correct logic should be:
   - For odd `n`, always print `n // 2 * b + a`.

Given this reasoning, the program's logic for odd `n` is flawed, and it may produce incorrect results in some cases.

Final: **False**
