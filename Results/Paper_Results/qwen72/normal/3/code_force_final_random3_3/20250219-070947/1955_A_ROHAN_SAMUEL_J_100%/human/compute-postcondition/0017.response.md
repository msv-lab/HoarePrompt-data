Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer from input.
- `a` is the second integer from input.
- `b` is the third integer from input.
- `_` is 1.
- If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if \(2 * a\) is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if \(2 * a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.
- If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if \(2 * a\) is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if \(2 * a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * n)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply multiplies the integer `a` by the integer `n` and prints the result.
- The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the value of `a * n` directly. They only provide constraints on the values of `a` and `b` based on the parity of `n`.

### Output:
- The value of `a * n` will be printed, where `a` is the second integer from input and `n` is the first integer from input.

Output: **a * n (where a is the second integer from input and n is the first integer from input)**
