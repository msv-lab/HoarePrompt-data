To determine what will be printed by the `print(n // 2 * b + a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
- `n` is the first integer from input.
- `a` is the second integer from input.
- `b` is the third integer from input.
- `_` is 1. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.

### Conditions:
- If `n` is odd:
  - The condition `2 * a < b` holds if \(2 * a\) is less than `b`.
  - The condition `2 * a >= b` holds if \(2 * a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.
- If `n` is even:
  - The condition `2 * a < b` holds if \(2 * a\) is less than `b`.
  - The condition `2 * a >= b` holds if \(2 * a\) is greater than or equal to `b`.

### Expression to Evaluate:
- The expression inside the `print` statement is `n // 2 * b + a`.

### Step-by-Step Evaluation:
1. **Integer Division (`n // 2`)**:
   - If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer that is exactly half of `n`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be the largest integer less than or equal to \( \frac{n}{2} \).

2. **Multiplication (`n // 2 * b`)**:
   - This multiplies the result of `n // 2` by `b`.

3. **Addition (`n // 2 * b + a`)**:
   - This adds `a` to the result of `n // 2 * b`.

### Final Output:
- The output will be the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n is the first integer from input, a is the second integer from input, and b is the third integer from input)**
