Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. The loop variable `_` is equal to `t - 1`. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `_` will be equal to `t - 1` because the loop runs from `_ = 0` to `_ = t - 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case will still be within their specified ranges (1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30). The conditions inside the loop that determine the output (whether `n` is odd or even, and the comparison between `2 * a` and `b`) will have been checked and applied for each iteration, but the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will depend on the input for the last iteration. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, as it determines the number of iterations the loop will run.
