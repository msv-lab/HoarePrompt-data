Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the price of one yogurt (`a`) and the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`). The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 1`)**:
   - If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. The total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy as many pairs of yogurts at the promotional price as possible and then buy the remaining single yogurt at the regular price. The total cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`)**:
   - If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. The total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. The total cost is `n // 2 * b`.

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 9`.
  - Since `n` is even, the program prints `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
  - Correct output: `9`.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 9`.
  - Since `n` is odd, the program prints `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - Correct output: `14`.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - Since `n` is odd, the program prints `a * n = 3 * 5 = 15`.
  - Correct output: `15`.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - Since `n` is even, the program prints `a * n = 4 * 5 = 20`.
  - Correct output: `20`.

The program correctly handles all the test cases in the example and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
