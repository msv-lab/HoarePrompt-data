Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is an input integer such that 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is an input integer such that 1 <= b <= 30, `_` is 0.**

The initial state is updated with the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` being assigned the integers read from the input, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 30. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 10,000. The value of `_` remains 0.
