Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `b` is the third integer from the new input, and `_` is 2. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.***
