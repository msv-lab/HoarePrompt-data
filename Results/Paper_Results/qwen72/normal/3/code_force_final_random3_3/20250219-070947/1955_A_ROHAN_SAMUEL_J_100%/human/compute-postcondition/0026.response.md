To determine what will be printed by the `print(a * n)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `a` is the second integer from the new input.
   - `b` is the third integer from the new input.
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
   - If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds if `2 * a` is less than `b`, and the condition `2 * a >= b` holds if `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(a * n)` will print the product of `a` and `n`.

Since the conditions provided do not affect the value of `a * n` directly, we can focus on the values of `a` and `n`:

- `a` is the second integer from the new input.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.

The output of the print statement will be the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a is the second integer from the new input and n is the first integer from the new input)**
