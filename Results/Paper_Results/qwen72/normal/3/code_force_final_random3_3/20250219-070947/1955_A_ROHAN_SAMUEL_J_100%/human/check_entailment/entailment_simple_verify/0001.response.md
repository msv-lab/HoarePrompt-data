Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. This is appropriate for the problem description.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
   - Otherwise, it prints the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price).

4. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`b`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts at the regular price).
   - Otherwise, it prints the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price if it is cheaper).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 (odd) and the promotion price is not used.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 2 (even) and the promotion price is used if it is cheaper.

6. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is correct. It considers both the regular and promotion prices and chooses the cheaper option for pairs of yogurts.
   - For odd `n`, it ensures that the last yogurt is bought at the regular price if the promotion price is not cheaper for a pair.
   - For even `n`, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price if it is cheaper.

7. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the test case `2 5 9`:
     - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is even, it checks `2 * a < b` which is `10 < 9` (False).
     - It prints `n // 2 * b` which is `1 * 9 = 9`.
   - For the test case `3 5 9`:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is odd, it checks `2 * a < b` which is `10 < 9` (False).
     - It prints `n // 2 * b + a` which is `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - For the test case `3 5 11`:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is odd, it checks `2 * a < b` which is `10 < 11` (True).
     - It prints `a * n` which is `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - For the test case `4 5 11`:
     - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is even, it checks `2 * a < b` which is `10 < 11` (True).
     - It prints `a * n` which is `4 * 5 = 20`.

Given the above reasoning and verification, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices and promotion.

Final: **True**
