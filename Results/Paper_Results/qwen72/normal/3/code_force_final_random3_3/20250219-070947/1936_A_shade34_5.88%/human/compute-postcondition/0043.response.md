The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `s` is the input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. Otherwise, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`), `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is not equal to `=`, and `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` is equal to `=`.**
