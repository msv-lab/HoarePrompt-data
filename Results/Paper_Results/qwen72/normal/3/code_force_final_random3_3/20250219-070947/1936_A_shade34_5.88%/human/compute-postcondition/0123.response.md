Postcondition: ***`pans` is either an empty list, `[0]` if the initial `s` was `=`, or `[1]` if the initial `s` was `<`. If the new `s` is `=`, `pans` is updated to `[2]`, `[0, 2]` if the initial `s` was `=`, or `[1, 2]` if the initial `s` was `<`. If the new `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 1. If the new `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values, and `pans` remains either an empty list or contains `[0]` if the initial `s` was `=`. `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, and `n` is an input integer greater than 2.***
