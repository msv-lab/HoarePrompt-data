Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pans` is a list with at least 3 elements.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mak2` is the largest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - If the user's current input is `>`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement starts with the string `?`.
   - The next two elements are `pans[mak]` and `pans[mak]`.
     - `mak` is either 0 or 1 based on the user's current input.
     - If the user's current input is `>`, `mak` is 1.
     - If the user's current input is not `>`, `mak` is 0.
   - The last two elements are `pans[i]` and `pans[i]`.
     - `i` is 2, so `pans[i]` is `pans[2]`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1: User's current input is `>`**
     - `mak` is 1.
     - The `print` statement will output: `? pans[1] pans[1] pans[2] pans[2]`.
   - **Scenario 2: User's current input is not `>`**
     - `mak` is 0.
     - The `print` statement will output: `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[2] pans[2]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, and `pans[2]` are not provided, we can only describe them based on their indices.
   - If the user's current input is `>`, the output will be: `? pans[1] pans[1] pans[2] pans[2]`.
   - If the user's current input is not `>`, the output will be: `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[2] pans[2]`.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[2] pans[2] (where mak is 0 if the user's current input is not `>`, and 1 if the user's current input is `>`, and pans[0], pans[1], and pans[2] are the first, second, and third elements of the pans list, respectively)**.
