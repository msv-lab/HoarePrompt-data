Postcondition: ***`pans` is either an empty list or a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `=`, or a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `=`, or a list containing `[0, 1]` if `s` was `<` and `pans` was `[0]` before. `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the new user input string. If the new `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, and `mak2` is 0.***
