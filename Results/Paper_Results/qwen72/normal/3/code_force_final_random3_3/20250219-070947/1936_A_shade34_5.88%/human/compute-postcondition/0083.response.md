Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this detail doesn't affect the print statement directly).
   - `mak` is 0 or 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - The user input is a string. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first argument to the `print` function is the string `'?'`.
   - The second and third arguments are both `mak`. Based on the initial state, `mak` can be either 0 or 1 depending on the user input.
   - The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is 2.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is set to 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`.
   - If the user input is anything other than `<`, then `mak` remains 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 2`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact user input is not provided, we need to consider both cases.
   - However, the output will be one of the two possible strings based on the value of `mak`.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 0 if the user input is not `<` and 1 if the user input is `<`)**
