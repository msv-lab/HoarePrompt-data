Output State: **`pans` is either `[2]`, `[0, 2]` if the initial `s` was `=`, or `[1, 2]` if the initial `s` was `<`. `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `n` is an input integer greater than 2. `s` is now the input string. If the new `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 1. If the new `s` is `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values. If the new `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values, and `pans` remains either `[2]` or contains `[0, 2]` if the initial `s` was `=`.**
