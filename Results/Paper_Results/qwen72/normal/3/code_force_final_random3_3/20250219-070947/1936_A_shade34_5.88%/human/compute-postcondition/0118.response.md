The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, but it does not change any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `pans`, `i`, `n`, `mak`, and `mak2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pans` is either an empty list, a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `=`, or a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `<`. `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `n` is an input integer greater than 2. If the new `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 1. If `s` is `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values. If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values, and `pans` remains either an empty list or contains `[0]` if `s` was `=`.**
