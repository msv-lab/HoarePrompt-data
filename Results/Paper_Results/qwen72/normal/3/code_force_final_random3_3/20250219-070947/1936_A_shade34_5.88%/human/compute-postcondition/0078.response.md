Output State: **`pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
