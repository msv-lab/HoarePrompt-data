The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`pans` is either an empty list or a list containing `[0]` if `s` is equal to `=`, `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the user input string. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is a list containing `[0]`, `mak` is 0, and `mak2` is 0. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list or contains `[0]` if `s` is `=`, and `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values.**
