Postcondition: **The number of rounds `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings where each card string is two characters long, the first character being one of "23456789" and the second being one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list, `rank` is the first character of the card string, `suit` is the second character of the card string, and `suit` is not equal to `trump`. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` contains one string which is the result of sorting `suits[suit]` and `rank` and then concatenating each with `suit` and joining them with a space. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `answers` remains an empty list and `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`. The values for the other keys in `suits` remain `None`.**
