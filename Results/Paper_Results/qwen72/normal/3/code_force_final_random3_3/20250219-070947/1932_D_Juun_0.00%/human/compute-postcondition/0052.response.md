Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be set to something other than `None`. If `rank` is `None`, the program skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without changing any of the variables. If `rank` is not `None`, `suit` is the next key in `suits` with a non-`None` value, `rank` is the corresponding non-`None` value for the next `suit`, if `trumps` is not empty, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element, and `answers` is a list that now includes an additional string formed by concatenating `rank`, `suit`, the last element of `trumps` (which has been removed from `trumps`), and `trump`. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing.***
