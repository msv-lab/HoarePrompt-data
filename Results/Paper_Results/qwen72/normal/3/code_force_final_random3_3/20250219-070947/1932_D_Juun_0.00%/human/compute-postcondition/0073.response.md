The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `trump`, and `cards`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of rounds, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 16.
- `trump` is a string representing the trump suit, which can be one of "C", "D", "H", or "S".
- `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, where each card string is two characters long. The first character of each card string is one of "23456789", and the second character is one of "C", "D", "H", or "S".

The function does not return any value in all cases.
