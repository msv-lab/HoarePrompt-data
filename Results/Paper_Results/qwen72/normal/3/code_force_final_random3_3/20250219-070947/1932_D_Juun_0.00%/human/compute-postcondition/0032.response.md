Postcondition: **The number of rounds `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings where each card string is two characters long, `card` is the next card string in the list, `rank` is the first character of the next `card`, `suit` is the second character of the next `card`, and `cards` must have at least one more unprocessed card string. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` now includes the `rank` of the next card. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, a new string is appended to `answers` which is the concatenation of `rank` and `suit` in sorted order, separated by a space, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits` is a dictionary with the key `suit` now mapped to the value `rank`.**
