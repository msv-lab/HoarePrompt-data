#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump` (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n unique card strings `cards` where each card string is two characters long, the first character being one of "23456789" and the second being one of "CDHS".
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: The number of rounds `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings where each card string is two characters long, the first character being one of "23456789" and the second being one of "CDHS". After all iterations, `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit. `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards that had the same suit but were not the trump suit, where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order, followed by the suit, and separated by a space. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None` because each suit is reset to `None` after processing a pair.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`, `trumps` is an empty list, and `answers` is a list containing strings for each pair of cards that had the same suit but were not the trump suit, where the strings are the ranks of the cards in sorted order, followed by the suit, and separated by a space.

    #State: `n` is between 1 and 16, `trump` is the input trump suit (one of "CDHS"), `cards` is a list of 2n unique card strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`, `trumps` is an empty list, and `answers` has been fully iterated through, meaning all elements in `answers` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a card game scenario where it takes three inputs: the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump` (one of "C", "D", "H", or "S"), and a list of 2n unique card strings `cards` (each card string is two characters long, with the first character being one of "23456789" and the second being one of "C", "D", "H", or "S"). The function does not return any value but prints the following: pairs of cards that had the same suit but were not the trump suit, with the ranks sorted and followed by the suit; pairs of trump cards, sorted by rank; and "IMPOSSIBLE" if there are not enough trump cards to form pairs with the remaining cards. After the function concludes, the input parameters `n`, `trump`, and `cards` remain unchanged, and the internal state of the function (variables `trumps`, `answers`, and `suits`) is reset or emptied.
