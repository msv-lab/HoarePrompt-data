The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first string in `data`.
- `idx` is 1.
- `test_cases` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not used, `idx` is 1, `test_cases` is an empty list**
