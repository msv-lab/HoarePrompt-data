### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_2):**
   - The function reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It processes the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next line and the array `arr` from the following line.
   - It appends these values as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.
   - This part of the program is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Beautiful Pairs Calculation (func_1):**
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`.
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and checks if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative, which is necessary for the correct calculation of `rx`.
   - The use of `a % y` directly gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`, which is correct for `ry`.
   - The dictionary `freq` is used to efficiently count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions, which is a valid approach for this problem.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), \(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), and \(1 \le x, y \le 10^9\) correctly.
   - It also handles the constraint that the sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm in `func_1` is correct in its approach to count the beautiful pairs. The use of the dictionary `freq` to keep track of the pairs \((a % x, a % y)\) and the calculation of `rx` and `ry` are both accurate.
  - The logic for checking if a pair is beautiful is also correct: \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program is efficient enough to handle the given constraints. The time complexity is \(O(n)\) per test case, and the space complexity is \(O(n)\) for the dictionary `freq`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `x` or `y` are 1, and when the array `arr` contains identical elements.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided constraints. The original assessment was accurate.
