Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary (previously empty), `count` is 0 if `(rx, ry)` is not a key in `freq`. If `(rx, ry)` is a key in `freq`, `count` is `freq[rx, ry]`. `a` is the first element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `current_pair` is assigned the tuple `(a % x, a % y)`.
- The values of `a % x` and `a % y` are calculated and stored in `current_pair`.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `count`, `a`, `rx`, `ry`) remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, and the calculations for `count`, `rx`, and `ry` are still valid.
- The new value of `current_pair` is explicitly stated as `(a % x, a % y)`.
