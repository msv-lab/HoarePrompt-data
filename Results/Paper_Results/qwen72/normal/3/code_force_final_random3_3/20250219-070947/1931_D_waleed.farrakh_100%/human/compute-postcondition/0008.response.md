Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not used, `idx` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing a single tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from splitting and converting `data[2]`, `arr` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `data[2]`.**

The code appends a tuple containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` to the `test_cases` list. The `test_cases` list, which was initially empty, now contains one tuple. The values of `t`, `_`, and `idx` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are derived from `data[2]` and are used to form the tuple that is appended to `test_cases`.
