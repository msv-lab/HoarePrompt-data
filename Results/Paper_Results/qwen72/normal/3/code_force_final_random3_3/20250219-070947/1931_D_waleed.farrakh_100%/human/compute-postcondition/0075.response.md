Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rx` is calculated using the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`.
- The value of `a` is the first element of `arr`.
- The value of `x` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
