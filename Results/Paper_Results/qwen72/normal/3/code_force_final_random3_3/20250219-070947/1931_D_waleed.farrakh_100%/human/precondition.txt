test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, and y, such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The length of test_cases is between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
