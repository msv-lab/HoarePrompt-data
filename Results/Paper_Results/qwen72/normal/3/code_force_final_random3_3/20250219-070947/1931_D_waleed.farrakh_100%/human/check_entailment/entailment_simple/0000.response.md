### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The `func_2` function reads the input from standard input and processes it correctly. It splits the input into lines and parses the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it correctly parses `n`, `x`, and `y` from the first line of the test case and the array `arr` from the second line.
   - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.

2. **Frequency Dictionary and Pair Counting:**
   - The `func_1` function processes each test case using a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x` (adjusted to be non-negative).
     - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count` of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, `func_1` returns a list `results` containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - `func_2` prints each result in `results`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
   - The use of the frequency dictionary ensures that the algorithm efficiently counts the pairs without having to check every possible pair explicitly, which would be computationally expensive for large arrays.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `t` is 1 (a single test case).
   - It also handles the edge case where `n` is 2 (the smallest possible array length), ensuring that the frequency dictionary is correctly updated and the count is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case and outputs the results correctly.

Correctness: **True**
