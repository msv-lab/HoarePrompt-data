Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and `arr` (a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and len(arr) = n). The length of `test_cases` is at most 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `arr` has `n` elements, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, and `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that have been encountered more than once during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, `count` is the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` has been encountered before it was added to `freq` for all elements `a` in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair encountered in `arr`, and `count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
