Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the second element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements.**

The code snippet `ry = a % y` updates the value of `ry` to be the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `ry` is now the result of `a % y`.
