Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not used, `idx` is 1, `test_cases` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from splitting and converting `data[2]`, `arr` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `data[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))` creates a new list `arr` by splitting the string `data[2]` (since `idx` is 1) and converting each element to an integer.
- The initial state variables `t`, `_`, `idx`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
- The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are still derived from `data[1]`, but `arr` is now specifically derived from `data[2]`.
