Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple.
- `results` is an iterable with at least one element.
- `result` is the next element in `results`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the next element in the `results` iterable. Since the exact value of `result` is not specified, we can only describe it based on the given information.

Output: **result (where result is the next element in the `results` iterable)**
