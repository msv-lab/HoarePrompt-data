The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the input integer `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is at least 1
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is an input string
- `b` is an input string
- `no_path` is a boolean value

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `n` remains the same as it is the input integer and does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `no_path` is a boolean value**
