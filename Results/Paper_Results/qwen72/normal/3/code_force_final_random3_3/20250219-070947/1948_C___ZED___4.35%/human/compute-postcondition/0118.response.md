Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 6
- `a` and `b` are input strings
- `k` is 5
- `no_path` is determined by the second character of `a`:
  - If the second character of `a` is not `>`, `no_path` is False.
  - Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`.

Since `k` is explicitly given as 5, the output of the `print(k)` statement will be:

Output: **5**
