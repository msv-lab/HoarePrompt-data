Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `k` is `n-1` if `n` is odd or `n` if `n` is even, `no_path` is False, and the character at index `k` in string `a` is not '>'**

The code snippet sets `no_path` to `False`, updating its value from `True`. All other initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
