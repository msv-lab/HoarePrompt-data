Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being `>`, and `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially True, then `k` remains the last even number less than `n`, and `no_path` remains True. If `no_path` is initially False, then `k` is the last odd number less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index (1, 3, 5, ..., `k`) in `a` is not `>`, `no_path` remains False. Otherwise, `no_path` is True. Additionally, if `no_path` is initially False, then `no_path` is set to False.***
