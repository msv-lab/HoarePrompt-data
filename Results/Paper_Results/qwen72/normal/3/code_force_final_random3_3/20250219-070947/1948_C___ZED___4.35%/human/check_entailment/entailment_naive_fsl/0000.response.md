Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where the robot can reach the cell (2, n) but the conditions in the code incorrectly determine that it cannot. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this example, the robot can follow the path: (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (2, 4). However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not correctly check all possible paths the robot can take to reach the target cell (2, n). The logic in the program is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
