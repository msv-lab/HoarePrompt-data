You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. The function then determines whether it is possible to make all characters in both strings point in the same direction by swapping characters within each string. It prints 'YES' if it is possible and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes the last processed values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which is the number of columns in the grid.
   - It then reads two strings `a` and `b`, representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.

2. **Initial Check for Last Column:**
   - The function checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`'>'`). If it is not, the robot cannot reach the last cell in the second row, and the function prints 'NO'.

3. **Special Case for Single Column:**
   - The function checks if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, the robot is already in the last cell of the second row, and the function prints 'YES'. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem constraints guarantee that `n` is at least 2.

4. **Check for Path in Even Columns:**
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `no_path` to `True`.
   - It iterates over the even-indexed columns (0, 2, 4, ..., n-2) in the second row (`b`).
   - If any of these columns do not point to the right (`'>'`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.

5. **Check for Path in Odd Columns:**
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after the even column check, it initializes `no_path` back to `True`.
   - It then iterates over the odd-indexed columns (1, 3, 5, ..., n-3) in the first row (`a`).
   - If any of these columns do not point to the right (`'>'`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both checks, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:

- **Initial Check for Last Column:**
  - This check is correct because if the second-to-last cell in the second row does not point to the right, the robot cannot reach the last cell in the second row.

- **Special Case for Single Column:**
  - This check is unnecessary and can be removed because `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2.

- **Check for Path in Even Columns:**
  - This check is incorrect. The robot can move along the arrows in the grid, and the even-indexed columns in the second row are not the only way to reach the last cell. The robot can also move to the first row and then back to the second row.

- **Check for Path in Odd Columns:**
  - This check is also incorrect for the same reason as the even columns check. The robot can move between rows and columns in various ways, and checking only the odd-indexed columns in the first row is not sufficient.

### Correctness:

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the robot's ability to move between rows and columns in a more flexible manner. The checks for even and odd columns are too restrictive and do not cover all possible paths the robot can take.

### Correctness: **False**
