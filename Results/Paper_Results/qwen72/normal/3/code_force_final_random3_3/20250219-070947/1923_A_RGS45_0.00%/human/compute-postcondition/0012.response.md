Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` updates the value of `y`.
- `arr[::-1]` reverses the string `arr`.
- `.find('1')` finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string.
- If '1' is not found in the reversed string, `y` is set to -1.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The value of `z` is still the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`, but `y` has been updated.
