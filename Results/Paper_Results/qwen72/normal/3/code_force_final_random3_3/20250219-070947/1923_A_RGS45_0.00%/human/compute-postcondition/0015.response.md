The only variables in the loop head are `t` and `_`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `_` will be incremented by 1, so `_` is now 2.
- `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**
