Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated to the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific value of `z` depends on the values of `x` and `y` as well as the length of `arr` (`n`). If `x` is -1 or `y` is -1, `z` will be an empty string or may raise an error if the indices are out of bounds. If `x` and `y` are valid indices, `z` will be the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
