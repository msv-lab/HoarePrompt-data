The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string `arr` of length `n` containing '0's and '1's, where '1' represents a cell with a chip and '0' represents a free cell. For each test case, the function finds the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`, extracts the substring between these occurrences, and prints the count of '0's in this substring. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the count of '0's for each test case.
