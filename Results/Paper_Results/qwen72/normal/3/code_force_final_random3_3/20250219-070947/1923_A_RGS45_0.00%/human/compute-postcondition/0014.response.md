Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is an input string.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` is the index of the first '1' in `arr`.
   - `y` is the index of the first '1' in the reversed `arr`. This means `y` is the index of the last '1' in the original `arr`.
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from the first '1' (`x`) to the position just before the last '1' (`n - y - 1`).

3. **Calculating `z`:**
   - If `x` is -1, it means '1' is not found in `arr`, and `z` will be an empty string.
   - If `y` is -1, it means '1' is not found in the reversed `arr`, which is equivalent to saying '1' is not found in the original `arr`, and `z` will be an empty string.
   - If both `x` and `y` are valid indices, `z` will be the substring from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.

4. **Counting '0' in `z`:**
   - If `z` is an empty string, the count of '0' will be 0.
   - If `z` is a non-empty substring, the count of '0' will be the number of '0's in that substring.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(z.count('0'))` statement will print the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **z.count('0') (where z is the substring of arr from the first occurrence of '1' to the position just before the last occurrence of '1', and z.count('0') is the number of '0's in this substring)**

If '1' is not found in `arr`, then:

Output: **0 (since z will be an empty string and the count of '0' in an empty string is 0)**
