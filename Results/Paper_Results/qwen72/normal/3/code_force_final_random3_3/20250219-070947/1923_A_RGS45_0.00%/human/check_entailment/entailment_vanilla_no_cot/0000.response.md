Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t = int(input(''))`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n = int(input(''))`: Reads the number of cells.
     - `arr = str(input(''))`: Reads the string representation of the ribbon cells.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: Finds the index of the first chip (1) in the ribbon.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: Finds the index of the last chip (1) in the ribbon by reversing the string and finding the first chip.

3. **Extracting the Substring with Chips:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: Extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This substring will contain all the chips and any free cells between them.

4. **Counting Free Cells Between Chips:**
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: Counts the number of free cells (0) in the extracted substring. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements. The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when all chips are already in a single block or when there are no free cells between the first and last chip. Therefore, the program is correct.
