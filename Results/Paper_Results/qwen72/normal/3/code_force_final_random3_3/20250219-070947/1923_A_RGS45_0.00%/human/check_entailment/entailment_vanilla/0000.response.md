### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - The program uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (from the left).
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip (from the right). This is equivalent to finding the index of the last chip from the left by subtracting the result from `n`.

3. **Extracting the Subarray:**
   - The program then extracts the subarray `z` that contains all the cells from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This is done using `arr[x:n - y]`.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the subarray `z` using `z.count('0')`.
   - The number of free cells in this subarray represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips so that they form a single block without any free cells between them.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the first and last chip in the ribbon.
- By extracting the subarray from the first chip to the last chip, it ensures that only the relevant portion of the ribbon is considered.
- Counting the number of free cells in this subarray gives the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles cases where there are no free cells between the chips (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1 1`), correctly outputting `0`.
- It also handles cases where the chips are already in a single block but not at the beginning or end of the ribbon (e.g., `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`), correctly outputting the number of free cells between the chips.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and should work for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
