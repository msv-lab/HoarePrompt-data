Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input(''))` updates the value of `n` to be an integer input by the user.
- The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `arr` is an input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, and `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to index `n - y - 1`.
- After executing the code, the only change is that `n` is now an input integer.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
