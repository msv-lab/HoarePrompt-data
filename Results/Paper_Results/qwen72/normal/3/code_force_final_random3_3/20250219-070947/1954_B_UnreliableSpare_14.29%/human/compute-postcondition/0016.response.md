Output State: **`n` is the same as the input, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged from the input.
- The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` (the last index of the list `arr` that was checked).
- The list `arr` remains the same as it was provided by the user.
- The variable `flag` will be `True` if all elements in the list `arr` are the same. If any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different, `flag` will be `False`, and the loop will have broken early.
