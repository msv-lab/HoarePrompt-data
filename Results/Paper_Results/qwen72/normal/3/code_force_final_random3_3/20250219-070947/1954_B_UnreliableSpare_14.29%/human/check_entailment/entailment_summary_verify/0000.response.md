### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is indeed flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Checking if all elements are the same:**
   - The program correctly checks if all elements in the array are the same using the `flag` variable. If they are, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Finding the minimum number of consecutive elements:**
   - The program then attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array before a different element is encountered. This is done by iterating through the array and counting the consecutive occurrences of `arr[0]`.
   - However, this approach is incorrect because it only considers the first element and its consecutive occurrences. It does not account for the general case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements that are not necessarily the first element.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 2 1 2 1
     ```
     The expected output is `1` because removing any one of the `2`s will make the array non-beautiful. However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove based on the first and last elements being the same.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
     - Identify the longest subarray that can be made non-beautiful by removing the fewest elements.
     - This involves checking for the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" property of the array, which is more complex than the current implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. The logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed and needs to be revised to consider the general case.
