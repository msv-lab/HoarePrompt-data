Output State: **`n` is the same as the input, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `val` is the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is the number of times the first element `val` appears consecutively from the start of the array. `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive `val` appearances before a different element is encountered, or `Decimal('Infinity')` if all elements are the same.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is the length of the input list.
- The value of `i` is `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed its last iteration.
- The list `arr` remains the same as the input list.
- The variable `flag` remains `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise it is `False`.
- The variable `val` is still the first element of the list `arr`.
- The variable `cnt` holds the count of how many times the first element `val` appears consecutively from the start of the array.
- The variable `ans` holds the minimum count of consecutive `val` appearances before a different element is encountered. If all elements in the list are the same, `ans` remains `Decimal('Infinity')`.
