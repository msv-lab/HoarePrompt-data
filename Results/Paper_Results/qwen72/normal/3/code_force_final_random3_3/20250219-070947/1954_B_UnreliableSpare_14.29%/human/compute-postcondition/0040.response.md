The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` must be a beautiful array, where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, and the length of the list `n` satisfies 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5. The function also handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given description.
