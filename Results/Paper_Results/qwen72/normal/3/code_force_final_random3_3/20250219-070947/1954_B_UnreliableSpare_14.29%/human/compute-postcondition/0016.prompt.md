Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` must be a beautiful array as defined in the problem description, where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. `n` is now an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user. `flag` is set to `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
        flag = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` is `True` if the second element of `arr` is equal to the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `flag` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
