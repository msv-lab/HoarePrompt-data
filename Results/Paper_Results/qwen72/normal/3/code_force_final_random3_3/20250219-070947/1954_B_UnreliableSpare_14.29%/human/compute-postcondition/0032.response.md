Postcondition: ***`n` is the same as the input and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 3 and `ans` remains `Decimal('Infinity')`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val` in the else part, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is 2. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val` in the else part, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.***
