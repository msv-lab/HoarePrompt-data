The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `cnt` was initially 2 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, and 0 if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, after the increment, `cnt` will be 3 if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, and 1 if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.

Output State: **`n` is the same as the input and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 3 and `ans` remains `Decimal('Infinity')`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0.**
