The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is the same as the input and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is the same as the input list of integers provided by the user, `flag` is `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` remains `Decimal('Infinity')`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
