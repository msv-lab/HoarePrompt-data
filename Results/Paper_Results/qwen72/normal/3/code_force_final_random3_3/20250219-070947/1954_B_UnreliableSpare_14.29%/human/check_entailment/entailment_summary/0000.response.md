Reasoning:

The program's goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where, through a series of operations, all elements can be made the same. The operations allowed are to replace an element at index `i` with its neighboring equal elements if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Minimum Removals:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same using a `flag`. If they are, it correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to make an array of identical elements non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - However, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element before a different element is encountered and uses this as the answer. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the overall structure of the array and how removing elements might affect the ability to make the array non-beautiful.

2. **Incorrect Use of `Decimal` for Minimum Count:**
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` for initializing `ans` is unnecessary and overcomplicates the solution. A simple Python `float('inf')` would suffice and is more conventional.
   - The program should instead focus on finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern that makes the array beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
- **Identify the Pattern:**
  - A beautiful array can be made non-beautiful by breaking the pattern where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`. This means we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no such pattern exists.
- **Check for Identical Elements:**
  - If all elements are the same, the array is inherently beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer is `-1`.
- **Count Elements to Remove:**
  - For arrays that are not all the same, we need to count the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern. This involves checking for sequences where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` and ensuring that removing the minimum number of elements breaks these sequences.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1: `[2, 2, 2]`**
  - All elements are the same, so the answer is `-1`.
- **Test Case 2: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`**
  - Removing the last element (index 4) breaks the pattern, making the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]` non-beautiful. The answer is `1`.
- **Test Case 3: `[1]`**
  - The array has only one element, so it is not beautiful by definition. The answer is `-1`.
- **Test Case 4: `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`**
  - Removing the first three elements (indices 0, 1, 2) breaks the pattern, making the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]` non-beautiful. The answer is `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. It does not properly account for the pattern that makes the array beautiful and how removing elements can break this pattern.

Correctness: **False**
