Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Function Definition and Call:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined after it is called in the main block. This will cause a `NameError` because `func_1` is not defined when it is first called.
   - The function `func_1` should be defined before it is called.

2. **Logic for Determining the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same and then uses this to determine the answer. However, this approach is incorrect.
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The current logic does not correctly handle this requirement.

3. **Handling of the "Beautiful" Array:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same using a flag. If they are, it prints `-1`, which is correct.
   - However, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It only considers the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same, which is not the correct approach.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Identify if the array is already non-beautiful. If it is, the answer is `0`.
- If the array is beautiful, we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful. This can be done by:
  - Checking if there are any elements that can be removed to break the "beautiful" property.
  - If all elements are the same, the answer is `-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if all elements are the same
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Check if the array is already non-beautiful
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1] and arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:
            print(0)
            return
    
    # If the array is beautiful, find the minimum number of elements to remove
    min_remove = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i] == arr[i - 1] or arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
            continue
        # Remove element at index i and check if the array becomes non-beautiful
        new_arr = arr[:i] + arr[i+1:]
        if not is_beautiful(new_arr):
            min_remove = min(min_remove, 1)
    
    # If no single element removal can make the array non-beautiful, try removing more elements
    if min_remove == float('inf'):
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                new_arr = arr[:i] + arr[i+1:j] + arr[j+1:]
                if not is_beautiful(new_arr):
                    min_remove = min(min_remove, j - i + 1)
                    break
            if min_remove != float('inf'):
                break
    
    if min_remove == float('inf'):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(min_remove)

def is_beautiful(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr) - 1):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1] and arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`is_beautiful` Function:** This function checks if the array is beautiful by iterating through the array and ensuring that for each index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`), `arr[i]` is equal to either `arr[i-1]` or `arr[i+1]`.
- **Main Logic in `func_1`:**
  - First, it checks if all elements are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`.
  - Then, it checks if the array is already non-beautiful. If it is, it prints `0`.
  - If the array is beautiful, it tries to remove one element at a time and checks if the resulting array is non-beautiful. If it is, it updates the minimum number of elements to remove.
  - If no single element removal can make the array non-beautiful, it tries removing more elements in a nested loop.
  - Finally, it prints the minimum number of elements to remove or `-1` if it is impossible.
