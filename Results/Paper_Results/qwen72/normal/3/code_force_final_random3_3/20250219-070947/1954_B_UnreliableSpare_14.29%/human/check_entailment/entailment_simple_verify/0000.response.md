### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by performing the specified operation any number of times.
   - If the array consists of identical elements, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, and the output should be `-1`.

2. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The initial assessment states that the program's logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. Specifically, it points out that the program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove based on the first and last elements being the same.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input for each test case and initializes a flag to `True` to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - It then iterates through the array to set the flag to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If the flag remains `True`, it means all elements are the same, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - If the flag is `False`, the program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and `val` to the first element of the array. It then counts the number of consecutive occurrences of `val` and updates `ans` to the minimum count of consecutive `val` appearances before a different element is encountered.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.

4. **Flaw in the Logic**:
   - The program's approach to finding the minimum number of elements to remove is based on the first element of the array and its consecutive occurrences. This is incorrect because the minimum number of elements to remove should be based on the entire array and not just the first element.
   - For example, in the input `1 2 1 2 1`, the program will set `ans` to `2` (the minimum count of consecutive `1`s before a `2` is encountered), but the correct answer is `1` (removing the last `1`).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation can make all elements the same.
   - One approach is to find the longest subarray where all elements are the same and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break this pattern. This involves checking for the longest sequence of identical elements and ensuring that removing elements from this sequence will prevent the array from being beautiful.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic is indeed flawed and does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem.
- The program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove based on the first element and its consecutive occurrences, which is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

Final: **False**
