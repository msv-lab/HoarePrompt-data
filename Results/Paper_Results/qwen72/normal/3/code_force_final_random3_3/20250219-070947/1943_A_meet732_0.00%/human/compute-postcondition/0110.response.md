Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, `j` and `c` are not affected. Otherwise, `j` is `n`, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`. If `c` becomes 0 before `j` reaches `n`, the loop will exit and `j` will be the value at which `c` became 0. If `c` is still greater than 0 when `j` reaches `n`, the loop will exit and `j` will be `n`.***
