Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is 2, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `c` and `j`.***
