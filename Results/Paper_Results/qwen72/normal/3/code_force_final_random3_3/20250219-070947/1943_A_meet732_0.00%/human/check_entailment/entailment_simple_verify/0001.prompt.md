You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. For each test case, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, and `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the output is 0. Otherwise, the output is the first index `j` in the range 1 to `n` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, or `n` if no such index exists. The loop has printed the output for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move given the current state of the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible integer that is not yet in `c` by removing it from `a`.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It then creates a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.

4. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means that 0 is not in the array `a`. Therefore, the MEX of `c` will be 0, and the program prints 0.

5. **Finding the Optimal MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the program initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can include at most 2 occurrences of 0 in `c` before Bob can remove the rest.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from 1 to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that Bob can remove at least one occurrence of `j` from `a`, preventing Alice from including both occurrences in `c`.
     - The program decreases `c` by 1 for each such `j` and checks if `c` becomes 0 or if `j` reaches `n`. If either condition is met, it prints `j` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where 0 is not in the array.
   - It also handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the array, ensuring that the MEX is correctly calculated.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It accurately calculates the MEX of the array `c` based on the given rules and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
