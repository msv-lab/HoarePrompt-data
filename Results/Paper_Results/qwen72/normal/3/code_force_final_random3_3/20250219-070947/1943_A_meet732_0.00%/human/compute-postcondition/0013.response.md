Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.**
