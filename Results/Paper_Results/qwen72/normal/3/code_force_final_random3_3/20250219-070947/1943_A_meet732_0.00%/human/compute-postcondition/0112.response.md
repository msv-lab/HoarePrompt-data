The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It internally handles multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the results for each test case. The exact output for each test case is not specified in the constraints, but it is implied that the function processes these inputs in some way and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It internally handles multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a result for each test case.**
