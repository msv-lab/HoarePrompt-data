The value at the index `i` of the list `cntl` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. After the execution, the element at index `i` will be 1, while all other elements remain 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `j`, and `c` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least one element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `j` and `c` are not affected.**
