Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `j` and `c` are not affected if `cntl[0]` is 0, otherwise `j` is `n` and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as the input integer greater than 0.
- The list `a` remains the same as the non-empty list of integers input by the user.
- The list `cntl` now contains the count of how many times each integer `i` (from 0 to `n`) appears in the list `a`.
- The variables `j` and `c` are not affected if `cntl[0]` is 0. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is set to `n`, and `c` is calculated as the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times `cntl[j]` was less than 2 for `j` from 1 to `n`.
