Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The logic for determining the MEX of the array `c` after all the moves is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.
   - It then checks if `cntl[0]` is zero and prints `0` if true. This is incorrect because the MEX of the array `c` is not necessarily `0` just because `0` is not in the array `a`.
   - The program then sets `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])` and iterates through the array `cntl` to find the MEX. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob are playing optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Alice should always pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` but is in `a` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should pick the smallest number that is in `a` to minimize the MEX.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach is to simulate the game by keeping track of the smallest number that can be added to `c` and ensuring that Alice and Bob play optimally.
   - Alice should always pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` but is in `a`.
   - Bob should pick the smallest number that is in `a`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if cntl[j] == 0:
                mex = j
                break
            elif cntl[j] == 1:
                if (n - j) % 2 == 1:
                    mex = j
                    break
        print(mex)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: We initialize a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.
- **Finding the MEX**: We iterate through the list `cntl` to find the smallest number `j` that is not in `a` (i.e., `cntl[j] == 0`). This is the MEX if `j` is not in `a`.
- **Optimal Play**: If `j` is in `a` but only once (`cntl[j] == 1`), we check if the number of remaining elements (i.e., `n - j`) is odd. If it is odd, Bob will eventually pick the last occurrence of `j`, and Alice will not be able to add it to `c`. Therefore, `j` will be the MEX.

This corrected program should correctly determine the final score of the game for each test case.
