The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a[i]` for all `i` in range `n` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0])`**
