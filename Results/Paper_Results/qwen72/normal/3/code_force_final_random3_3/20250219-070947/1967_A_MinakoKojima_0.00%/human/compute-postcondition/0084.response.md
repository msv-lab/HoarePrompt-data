The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, as well as a list `a`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the list `a`. `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing a target value. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the elements to be processed. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on the processing of these parameters and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12). It processes these parameters and returns a result based on the given inputs.**
