The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[1] - a[0])`**
