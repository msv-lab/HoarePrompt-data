The provided code snippet updates the values of `n` and `k` by reading two integers from the input. The initial values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this code, but they are reassigned based on the new input. The other variables (`_`, `a`, `m`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, and `ans` is 0. `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user.**
