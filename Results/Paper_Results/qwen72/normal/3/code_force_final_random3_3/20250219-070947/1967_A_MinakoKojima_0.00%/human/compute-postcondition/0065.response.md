Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`**

Explanation:
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`.
- `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`.
