The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.** 

Note: The values of `n` and `k` are now the specific integers provided by the user, but since the initial state already specifies that `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, this condition remains valid. The other variables (`_`, `a`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
