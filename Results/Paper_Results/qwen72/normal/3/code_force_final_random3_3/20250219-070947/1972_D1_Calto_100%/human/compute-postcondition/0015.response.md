The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns a value `cnt`, which is calculated based on a formula that involves iterating from 1 to `m` and summing up a specific expression for each `i` in this range. The expression used in the summation is `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)`, and the final result is `cnt - 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns a value `cnt` which is the sum of a specific expression for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`, minus 1.**
