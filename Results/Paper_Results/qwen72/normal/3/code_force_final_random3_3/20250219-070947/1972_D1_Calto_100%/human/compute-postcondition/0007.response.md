Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0), `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 4, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

The value of `y` is updated to 4, as `y` is assigned the value of `i * i`, where `i` is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
