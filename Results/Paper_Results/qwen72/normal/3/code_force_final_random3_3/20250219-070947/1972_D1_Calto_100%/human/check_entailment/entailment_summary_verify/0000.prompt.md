You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns an integer `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is calculated as the sum of a specific expression for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`, minus 1. Specifically, for each `i`, the expression is `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)`. The final state of the program is that `cnt` holds this computed value, while `n` and `m` remain unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The issue lies in the logic of `func_2`:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x` and `y`**:
   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic used in the program seems to be attempting to count pairs in a different manner, but it does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the edge case where \(a\) and \(b\) are both 1 correctly. The correct output for the pair (1, 1) should be 1, but the program's logic might not produce this result consistently.

3. **General Logic Error**:
   - The program does not correctly iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:

- For the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the correct pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\). The program should output 4, but it does not.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
