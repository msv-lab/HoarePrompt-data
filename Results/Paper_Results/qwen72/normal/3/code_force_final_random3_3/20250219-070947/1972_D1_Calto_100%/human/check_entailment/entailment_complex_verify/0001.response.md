### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function is correct and can be used to find \(\gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - However, the logic in the function is flawed:
     - **Initialization**: `cnt` is initialized to \(-1\), which is incorrect. The count of valid pairs should start at \(0\).
     - **Loop**: The loop iterates over \(i\) from \(1\) to \(m\), but \(i\) is not used to represent \(b\). Instead, \(i\) is used in a complex expression that does not directly relate to the problem's conditions.
     - **Expression**: The expression \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\) does not align with the requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - **Update**: The update `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not logically consistent with the problem's conditions.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided function `func_2` does not use the GCD function `func_1` to check this condition.
   - The logic of the function is based on a different and unrelated formula, which does not solve the problem as described.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case \((1, 1)\):
     - The only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), which satisfies \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
     - The function `func_2` should return \(1\), but it does not.
   - For the fourth test case \((10, 8)\):
     - The valid pairs are \((1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)\).
     - The function `func_2` should return \(14\), but it does not.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the given problem. The function `func_2` is not correctly counting the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the problem's conditions.

Final: **False**
