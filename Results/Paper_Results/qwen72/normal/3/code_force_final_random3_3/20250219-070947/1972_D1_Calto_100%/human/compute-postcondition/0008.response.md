Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) + math.ceil((n - 2) / 4) + ((n - 2) % 4 == 0), `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 4, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y)` and `(x % y == 0)` to its current value.
- The value of `x` is `n - 2`.
- The value of `y` is 4.
- `math.ceil(x / y)` computes the ceiling of `(n - 2) / 4`.
- `(x % y == 0)` checks if `(n - 2) % 4` is 0, and adds 1 if true, otherwise adds 0.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 remains valid.
