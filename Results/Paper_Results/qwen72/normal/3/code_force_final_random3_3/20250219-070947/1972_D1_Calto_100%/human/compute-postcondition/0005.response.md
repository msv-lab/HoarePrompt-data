The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0), `i` is 2, `x` is `n`, `y` is 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**
