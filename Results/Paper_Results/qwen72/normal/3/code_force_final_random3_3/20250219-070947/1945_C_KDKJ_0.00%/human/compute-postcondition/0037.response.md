Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least `len(a)` characters, `S` is a list containing `len(a) + 1` sublists, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is the sum of the first two elements of the first sublist in `S`, `right` is the second element of the last sublist in `S` minus the second element of the first sublist in `S`, `rsum` is `n - lsum`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration or statement. Otherwise, `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, this condition is retained.***
