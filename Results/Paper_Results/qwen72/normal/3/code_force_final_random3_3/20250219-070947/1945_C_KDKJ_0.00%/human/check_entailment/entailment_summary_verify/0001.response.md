### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1` `t` times.
   - `func_1` reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents for each test case.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sum array `S` is correctly constructed in `func_1`. Each element `S[i]` contains the cumulative count of zeros and ones up to the i-th house.
   - This allows for efficient calculation of the number of zeros and ones on both sides of any potential road position.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` are used to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - These conditions are correctly implemented and checked for each position `i`.

4. **Middle Position Calculation:**
   - The program correctly updates the answer `ans` to the position `i` that is closest to the middle of the village, using the condition `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`.
   - This ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle of the village as possible while satisfying the residents' preferences.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house (output 0) or after the last house (output `n`).
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to 0, which is appropriate for the case where the road is placed before the first house.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Prefix Sum Array:**
  - The prefix sum array `S` is constructed as follows:
    ```python
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        (x, y) = S[-1]
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        S.append([x, y])
    ```
  - This ensures that `S[i][0]` and `S[i][1]` correctly represent the cumulative counts of zeros and ones up to the i-th house.

- **Condition Checking:**
  - The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` are correctly implemented:
    ```python
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - lsum
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    ```
  - These conditions ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.

- **Middle Position Calculation:**
  - The program updates the answer `ans` to the position `i` that is closest to the middle of the village:
    ```python
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i
    ```
  - This ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle as possible while satisfying the conditions.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the position `ans` for each test case:
    ```python
    print(ans)
    ```

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given conditions and constraints. It efficiently processes multiple test cases and ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle of the village as possible while satisfying the residents' preferences.
