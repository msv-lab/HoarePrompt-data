Output State: **`int(input())` must return a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code snippet `func_1()` simply calls the function `func_1()`. Since the initial state already mentions that `func_1()` has been called, calling it again does not change the state of the program. The value of `_` remains 2, and `int(input())` still must return a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. No new information or changes to the variables are provided by the code snippet.
