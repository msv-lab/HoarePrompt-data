Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least `len(a)` characters, `S` is a list containing `len(a) + 1` sublists, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - lsum`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the program continues to the next iteration or statement. Otherwise, `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, this condition is retained.**
