Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string consisting only of '0' and '1' provided by the user that must have at least three characters, `s` is the third character of `a`, if `s` is '0' then `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, if `s` is '1' then `x` is 0 and `y` is 3, `S` is a list containing three sublists: `[0, 0]`, `[x, y]`, and `[x, y]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is incremented by 1.
- If `s` is '0', `y` was initially 0, so it becomes 1.
- If `s` is '1', `y` was initially 2, so it becomes 3.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The list `S` is updated to reflect the new value of `y` in its second and third sublists.
