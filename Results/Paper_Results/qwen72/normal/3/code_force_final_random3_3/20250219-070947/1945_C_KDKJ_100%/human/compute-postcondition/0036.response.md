Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is -1 or 0 depending on the condition, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, the program skips the rest of the current loop iteration. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is updated to 0. If neither of these conditions is met, `ans` remains -1.***
