Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is -1 or 0 depending on the condition, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n`**

Explanation:
- The value of `right` is updated to `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]` because `i` is 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `S`, `ans`, `left`, `lsum`, `rsum`) remain unchanged.
