Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `func_1()` has been called the number of times specified by `int(input())`.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will have completed all its iterations if the number provided by `int(input())` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, and the function `func_1()` will have been called exactly that many times.
