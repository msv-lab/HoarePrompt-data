Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is 2, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is -1 or 0 depending on the initial condition.**

Explanation: The code snippet `lsum = i` updates the value of `lsum` to 2, as `i` is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
