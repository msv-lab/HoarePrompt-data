Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string with `n` characters, `S` is a list containing `n + 1` sublists, `ans` is -1, `left` is the first element of the first sublist in `S`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`.**

The value of `right` is calculated as the difference between the second element of the last sublist in `S` and the second element of the first sublist in `S`. All other variables and their properties remain unchanged.
