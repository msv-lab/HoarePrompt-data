Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- `res` is updated to the new input string.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `mini` remain unchanged.
- The value of `maxi` depends on the new value of `res`. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.
