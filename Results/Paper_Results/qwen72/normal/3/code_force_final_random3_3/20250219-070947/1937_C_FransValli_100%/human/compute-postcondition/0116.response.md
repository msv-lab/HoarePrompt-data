Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is `'>'.`, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is `item`.**

The code assigns the value of `item` to `mini`. The values of `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `res`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `mini` now holds the value of `item`.
