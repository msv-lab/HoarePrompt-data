Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or it remains 0 if no such index exists.
   - `arr` is `[0]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `maxi`: Based on the initial state, `maxi` is either 0 (if no index `i` exists where `res` was '<') or some positive integer (the largest index where `res` was '<').
   - `arr[0]`: The first element of the list `arr` is 0.
   - `i`: The value of `i` is 1.
   - `flush=True`: This is an argument to the `print` function that ensures the output is immediately written to the console.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with '?', followed by the value of `maxi`, the value of `arr[0]`, the value of `maxi` again, and the value of `i`.
   - Since `arr[0]` is explicitly 0, and `i` is explicitly 1, the only variable that can vary is `maxi`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 1 (where [maxi] is the value of maxi, which is either 0 or the largest index i for which the input res was '<')**
