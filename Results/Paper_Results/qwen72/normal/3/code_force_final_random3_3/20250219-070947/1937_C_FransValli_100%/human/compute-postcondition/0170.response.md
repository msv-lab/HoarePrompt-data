Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. If `res` is `<`, `arr` is `[2]`. If `res` is `=`, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `arr` is `[0, 2]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to the new input string provided by the user. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `arr`) are not affected by this code, so their initial states remain unchanged. The value of `res` now depends on the new input provided.
