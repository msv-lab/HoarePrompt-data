The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is the new input string, and `maxi` is 2**
