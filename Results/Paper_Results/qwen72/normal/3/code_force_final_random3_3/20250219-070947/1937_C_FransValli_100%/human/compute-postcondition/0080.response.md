Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `res` is the new input provided by the user.
- If `res` is '<', `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: The value of `n` is greater than 3, but it is not directly used in the `print` statement.
2. **`i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 3.
3. **`res`**: The value of `res` is provided by the user. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is set to 2. If `res` is anything other than '<', `maxi` remains unchanged.
4. **`maxi`**: The value of `maxi` depends on the user input `res`. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2. Otherwise, `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it remains `None` or some other default value.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **If `res` is '<':**
  - `maxi` is set to 2.
  - The `print` statement will output: `? 2 2 3 3`.

- **If `res` is not '<':**
  - `maxi` remains unchanged (assumed to be `None` or some other default value).
  - The `print` statement will output: `? [maxi] [maxi] 3 3`, where `[maxi]` is the value of `maxi` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state).

### Final Output:
Since the initial state does not provide a default value for `maxi` if `res` is not '<', we need to consider both scenarios:

- If `res` is '<':
  Output: **? 2 2 3 3**

- If `res` is not '<':
  Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 3 3 (where [maxi] is the value of `maxi` before the condition is checked)**

Given the task, we should provide the most precise description possible based on the precondition. Since the precondition does not specify a default value for `maxi` if `res` is not '<', we cannot determine the exact value of `maxi` in that case.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 3 3 (where [maxi] is 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise it is the value of `maxi` before the condition is checked)**
