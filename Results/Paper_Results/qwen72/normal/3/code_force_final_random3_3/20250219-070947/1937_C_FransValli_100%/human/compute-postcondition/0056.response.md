Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` remains 0, `arr` is a list of integers `i` for which the input `res` was either '<' or '=' and must have at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element in the list `arr`, `mini` is the third element in the list `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mini` is updated to be the same as `item`, which is the third element in the list `arr`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
