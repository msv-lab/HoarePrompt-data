The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is [1]. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is [0, 1] and `res` remains '='. Otherwise, `arr` remains [0] and `res` remains not equal to '<'.**
