The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. The initial state of `i` is `n-1`, which is not suitable for the loop to start as it should begin at 1. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the last input string, `arr` is `[0]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.**
