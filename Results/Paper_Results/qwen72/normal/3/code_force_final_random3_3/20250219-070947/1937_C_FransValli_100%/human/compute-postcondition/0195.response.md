Output State: **The loop has executed `int(input())` times, and for each execution, the final state is as follows:**

- `n` is the input integer for the current iteration, which is the same as the initial `n` for that iteration.
- `maxi` is the index of the element in the permutation that has the highest value when compared with all other elements using the XOR operation.
- `arr` is a list containing the index of the element that is equal to `maxi` and all other indices that have the same value as `maxi` when XORed with `maxi`.
- `mini` is the index of the element in `arr` that has the smallest value when compared with all other elements in `arr` using the XOR operation.
- The final output for each iteration is the indices `maxi` and `mini` that maximize the XOR operation in the permutation.

This means that after all iterations, the loop has found the indices `i` and `j` for each input `n` that maximize the XOR of any two indices in the permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The loop makes queries to determine these indices and outputs them in the format `! maxi mini` for each iteration.
