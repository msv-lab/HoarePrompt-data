Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem as described. The program correctly interacts with the judge to find a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Query to Find Maximum OR Value**:
   - The program starts by iterating over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes `maxi` to 0, which will store the index of the element that, when ORed with itself, gives the maximum value.
   - It then queries the judge for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\) to compare \(p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\). If the result is '<', it updates `maxi` to \(i\). This step ensures that `maxi` is the index of the element with the highest value when ORed with itself.

2. **Finding Elements with the Same Maximum OR Value**:
   - The program initializes `arr` with the index 0.
   - It then queries the judge to compare \(p_{maxi} \mid p_{arr[0]}\) with \(p_{maxi} \mid p_i\) for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\). If the result is '<', it updates `arr` to contain \(i\). If the result is '=', it appends \(i\) to `arr`.
   - This step identifies all indices \(i\) such that \(p_{maxi} \mid p_i\) is equal to the maximum OR value found in the previous step.

3. **Finding the Minimum Element Among the Maximum OR Values**:
   - The program initializes `mini` to the first element in `arr`.
   - It then queries the judge to compare \(p_{mini} \mid p_{mini}\) with \(p_{item} \mid p_{item}\) for each `item` in `arr[1:]`. If the result is '>', it updates `mini` to `item`.
   - This step ensures that `mini` is the index of the element with the smallest value when ORed with itself among the elements with the maximum OR value.

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - Finally, the program outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the pair that maximizes \(p_i \oplus p_j\).

The program adheres to the constraints and the interaction rules specified in the problem description, and it uses at most \(3n\) queries, which is within the allowed limit. Therefore, the program is correct.
