Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the last input string, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists. The loop will execute again if the user provides a positive integer input.**

The code snippet `maxi = 0` resets the value of `maxi` to 0, but all other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update while maintaining the initial state for the other variables.
