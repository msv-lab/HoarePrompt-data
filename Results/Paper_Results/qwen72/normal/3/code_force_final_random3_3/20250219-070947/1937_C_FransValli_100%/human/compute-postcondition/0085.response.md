Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop iterations, or it remains 0 if no such index exists, `arr` is `[0]`.**

The code snippet `arr = [0]` initializes the variable `arr` to a list containing a single element, which is `0`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `n`, `i`, and `maxi`, along with the new value of `arr`.
