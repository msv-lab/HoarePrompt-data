The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 3. The condition `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, so `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, and `res` is the new input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is [2]. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is [0, 1, 2] and `res` remains '='. Otherwise, `arr` is [0, 2] and `res` remains not equal to '<'.**
