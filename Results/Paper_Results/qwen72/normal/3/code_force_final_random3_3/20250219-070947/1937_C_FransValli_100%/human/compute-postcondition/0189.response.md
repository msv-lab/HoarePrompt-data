Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses.
   - `res` is the new input string.
   - `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<` and must have at least 4 elements.
   - `mini` is the third element in `arr` if `res` is `'>`, otherwise `mini` is `arr[0]`.
   - `item` is the fourth element in `arr`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mini` and `item` are determined based on the conditions given in the initial state.
   - If `res` is `'>`, then `mini` is the third element in `arr`.
   - If `res` is not `'>`, then `mini` is the first element in `arr`.
   - `item` is always the fourth element in `arr`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?` followed by the values of `mini` and `item` repeated twice.
   - The exact values of `mini` and `item` depend on the content of `arr` and the value of `res`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is `'>`, the output will be `? arr[2] arr[2] arr[3] arr[3]`.
   - If `res` is not `'>`, the output will be `? arr[0] arr[0] arr[3] arr[3]`.

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where mini is the third element in arr if res is '>', otherwise mini is the first element in arr, and item is the fourth element in arr)**
