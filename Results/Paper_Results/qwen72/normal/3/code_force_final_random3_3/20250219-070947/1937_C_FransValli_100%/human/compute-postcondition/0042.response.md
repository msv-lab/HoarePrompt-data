The value of `i` (which is 3) is appended to the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` was [2]. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` was [0, 1, 2]. Otherwise, `arr` was [0, 2]. After appending `i`, the updated `arr` will be:

- If `res` is '<', `arr` becomes [2, 3].
- If `res` is '=', `arr` becomes [0, 1, 2, 3].
- Otherwise, `arr` becomes [0, 2, 3].

The other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `maxi`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is [2, 3]. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is [0, 1, 2, 3]. Otherwise, `arr` is [0, 2, 3].**
