You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an interactive environment where it can make queries to find the maximum XOR of any two indices in a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The input n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and the function can make at most 3n queries. The permutation p is fixed and not adaptive, and the function must output the indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize p_i ⊕ p_j.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `int(input())` times, and for each execution, the final state is as follows:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates in an interactive environment to find the maximum XOR of any two indices in a fixed permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4. It returns the indices `i` and `j` (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize the XOR value `p_i ⊕ p_j`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
