Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is the new input string.
   - If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is [2].
   - If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is [0, 1, 2] and `res` remains '='.
   - Otherwise, `arr` is [0, 2] and `res` remains not equal to '<'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `arr[0]`:**
   - The value of `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`.
   - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [2], so `arr[0]` is 2.
   - If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [0, 1, 2], so `arr[0]` is 0.
   - If `res` is anything else, then `arr` is [0, 2], so `arr[0]` is 0.

4. **Determine the Values of `maxi` and `i`:**
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `i` is 3.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will always output the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi`, the value of `arr[0]`, the value of `maxi` again, and the value of `i`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

- If `res` is '<':
  - `arr` is [2], so `arr[0]` is 2.
  - Output: **? 0 2 0 3**

- If `res` is '=':
  - `arr` is [0, 1, 2], so `arr[0]` is 0.
  - Output: **? 0 0 0 3**

- If `res` is anything else:
  - `arr` is [0, 2], so `arr[0]` is 0.
  - Output: **? 0 0 0 3**

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider all possible cases. However, the most precise description based on the given conditions is:

Output: **? 0 [arr[0]] 0 3 (where [arr[0]] is 2 if res is '<', and 0 otherwise)**
