Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `mini` is `arr[1]` if `res` is `'>`', otherwise `mini` is `arr[0]`, `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<`, and `item` is the third element in `arr`.** 

The code snippet `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to the new input string provided by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
