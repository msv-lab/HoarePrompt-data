The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is `[2]`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`. If `res` is not '<' and not '=', then `arr` is `[0]`.**
