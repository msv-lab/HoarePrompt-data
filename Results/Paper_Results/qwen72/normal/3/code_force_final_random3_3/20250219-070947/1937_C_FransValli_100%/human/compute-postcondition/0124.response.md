Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is a new input string (though it is not used in the print statement).
   - `arr` is a list containing integers from 0 to `n-1` (i.e., `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`).
   - `item` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - `'?'` is a string literal.
   - `mini` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `maxi` is defined as 0, it is reasonable to assume that `mini` is also an integer, and it is likely to be 0 (the smallest value in the list `arr`).
   - `item` is explicitly defined as 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `mini` twice, and then the value of `item` twice.
   - Given the initial state, `mini` is likely to be 0, and `item` is 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
