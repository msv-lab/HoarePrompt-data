Postcondition: ***`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses, `res` is the new input string, `mini` is `arr[1]` if `res` is `'>`', otherwise `mini` is `arr[0]`, `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the input was `=` or the last index for which the input was `<`, and `arr` must have at least two elements, `item` is the second element in `arr`.***
