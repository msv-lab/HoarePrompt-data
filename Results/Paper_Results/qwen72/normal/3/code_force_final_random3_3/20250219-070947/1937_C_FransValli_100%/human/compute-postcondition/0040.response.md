Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 0, and `res` is the new input string. If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is [2]. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is [0, 1, 2] and `res` remains '='. Otherwise, `arr` is [0, 2] and `res` remains not equal to '<'.**

The code snippet `res = input()` updates the value of `res` to a new input string. The initial state specifies that if `res` is equal to '<', `arr` is [2]. If `res` is equal to '=', `arr` is [0, 1, 2] and `res` remains '='. Otherwise, `arr` is [0, 2] and `res` remains not equal to '<'. The values of `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.
