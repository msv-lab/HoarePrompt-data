Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the user input is a positive integer.
   - `_` is 0. This variable is not used in the print statement.
   - `n` must be greater than 2. This means `n` is a positive integer greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2. This is a fixed integer value.
   - `res` is the input string. This means `res` is the string input provided by the user.
   - If `res` is equal to '<', `maxi` is set to 1. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first element in the print statement is the string `'?'`.
   - The second and third elements are `maxi`, which is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `res`.
   - The fourth and fifth elements are `i`, which is 2.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1.
   - If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is 0.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `res` is '<', the print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`.
   - If `res` is not '<', the print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 2`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios:

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 2 2 (where [maxi] is 1 if `res` is '<' and 0 otherwise)**
