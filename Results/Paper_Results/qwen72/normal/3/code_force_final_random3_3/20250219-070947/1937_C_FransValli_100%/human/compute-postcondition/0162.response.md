Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses.
   - `res` is the new input string.
   - `mini` is the smallest index for which the input was '>', or 0 if no such index exists.
   - If `res` is `<`, `arr` is `[1]`.
   - Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]` if `res` is not `=`, or `[0, 1]` if `res` is `=`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determining the Values:**
   - `maxi` is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses. This value is not explicitly given, so we will represent it as `maxi`.
   - `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `<`, then `arr` is `[1]`, so `arr[0]` is `1`.
     - If `res` is `=`, then `arr` is `[0, 1]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
     - If `res` is anything else (not `<` or `=`), then `arr` is `[0]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

4. **Constructing the Output:**
   - The print statement will always start with `?`.
   - The next value is `maxi`, which is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses.
   - The next value is `arr[0]`, which is either `1` if `res` is `<`, or `0` otherwise.
   - The next value is `maxi` again.
   - The last value is `i`, which is 2.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If `res` is `<`, the output will be: `? maxi 1 maxi 2`.
- If `res` is `=`, the output will be: `? maxi 0 maxi 2`.
- If `res` is anything else, the output will be: `? maxi 0 maxi 2`.

Since the exact value of `maxi` is not provided, we will represent it as `maxi` in the output.

Output: **? maxi [arr[0]] maxi 2 (where [arr[0]] is 1 if res is `<`, or 0 otherwise, and maxi is the index of the last occurrence of `<` in the input responses)**
