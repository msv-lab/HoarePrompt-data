Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. All elements in the list except the last one are set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. The function modifies the value of `k` during its execution, but this change is not visible to the user as `k` is not returned. **
