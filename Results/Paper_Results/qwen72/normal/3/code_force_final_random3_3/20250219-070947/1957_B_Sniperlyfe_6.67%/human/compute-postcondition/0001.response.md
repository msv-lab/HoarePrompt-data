The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the first element in the range of `n`. The other variables (`k` and `nums`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0**
