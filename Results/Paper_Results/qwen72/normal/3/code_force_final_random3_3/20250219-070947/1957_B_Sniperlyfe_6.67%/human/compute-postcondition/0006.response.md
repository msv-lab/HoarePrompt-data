Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the second element now initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `k` is now `k - 2 * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `nums[i]` from it.
- Since `i` is 1, `nums[i]` refers to the second element of the `nums` list, which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The initial value of `k` was `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
- After subtracting `nums[i]` from `k`, the new value of `k` becomes `k - 2 * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The `nums` list remains the same, with the first two elements initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
