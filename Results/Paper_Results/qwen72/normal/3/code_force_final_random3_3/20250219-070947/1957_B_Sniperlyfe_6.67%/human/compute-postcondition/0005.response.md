Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the second element now initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `k` is now `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[i]` is updated to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- Since `i` is 1, the second element of the list `nums` is now set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The value of `k` remains `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
- The initial state conditions for `n`, `i`, and the first element of `nums` remain unchanged.
