The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n`. All elements in the list, except the last one, are initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The last element in the list is initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. Additionally, the value of `k` is updated to `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n` where all elements except the last one are initialized to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.**
