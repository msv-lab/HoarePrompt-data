Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly reads the input values for `n` and `t`, and the edges of the tree. It constructs the adjacency list `nodes` to represent the tree, which is a common and efficient way to handle graph data structures in Python.

2. **Tree Construction**: The function correctly constructs the tree by adding neighbors to each node. This is done using a `defaultdict` of lists, which is appropriate for representing a tree or any graph where nodes can have multiple neighbors.

3. **Leaf Nodes Identification**: The function identifies leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one neighbor) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. However, this deque is not used in the rest of the function, so its presence is unnecessary for the problem at hand.

4. **Game Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the distances from the starting node to all its child nodes. It does this recursively, and the distances are incremented by 1 for each level of depth. This is correct for determining the depth of each node from the starting node.
   - The function `func_2` then calls `func_1` with the starting node and the constructed tree. The result is a list of distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - The game logic is based on the fact that if any of the distances is odd, Ron will win the round. This is because in a tree, if there is an odd path length from the starting node to any leaf node, Ron can always force a win by moving to a node that leaves an even number of moves for Hermione, and vice versa.

5. **Output**: The function prints 'Ron' if any of the distances is odd, and 'Hermione' otherwise. This is consistent with the game rules and the problem description.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the tree structure and the starting node. The unnecessary deque `leaves` does not affect the correctness of the program, but it could be removed for clarity.

Correctness: **True**
