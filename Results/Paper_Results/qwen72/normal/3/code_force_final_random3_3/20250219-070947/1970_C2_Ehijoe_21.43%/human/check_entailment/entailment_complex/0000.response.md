### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The program constructs a tree using an adjacency list representation. This is done by reading `n - 1` edges and adding each node to the list of its neighbors. This is a standard and correct way to represent a tree.

2. **Leaf Nodes Identification**:
   - The program identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one neighbor) and stores them in a deque. This is not strictly necessary for the solution, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the distances from the starting node to all its child nodes. If the starting node has no children (or all children are the parent node), it returns a list containing the single element 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances to all child nodes that are not the parent node and increments each distance by 1.
   - The function `func_2` reads the starting node for the round and calls `func_1` to get the list of distances. It then checks if any of the distances is odd. If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins the round; otherwise, Hermione wins the round.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - In a tree, the game can be analyzed based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the leaf nodes. If the starting node has an odd distance to any leaf node, Ron can always force a win by moving to that node, as the number of moves required to reach a leaf node from an odd-distance node will always be odd, giving Ron the last move.
   - Conversely, if all distances from the starting node to the leaf nodes are even, Hermione will always win because the number of moves required to reach a leaf node from an even-distance node will always be even, giving Hermione the last move.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the starting node is a leaf node (distance 0, which is even, so Hermione wins).
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the starting node has multiple neighbors, and the distances to those neighbors are calculated and checked for parity.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the leaf nodes. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve this, and the program handles all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
