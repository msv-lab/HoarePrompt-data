Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. `leaves` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key, `key` is the first key in `nodes`. If the length of the list associated with `key` in `nodes` is 1, `leaves` is a deque containing the first key in `nodes`. Otherwise, `leaves` remains an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with at least two keys, `key` is the second key in `nodes`, and `leaves` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration if `len(nodes[key])` is not 1. If `len(nodes[key])` is 1, `leaves` is a list that now includes `key` as its new last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with at least three keys, `key` is the third key in `nodes`. If `len(nodes[key])` is 1, `leaves` is a list that now includes `key` as its new last element. Otherwise, `leaves` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
