Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with at least three keys, `key` is the third key in `nodes`. If `len(nodes[key])` is 1, `leaves` is a list that now includes `key` as its new last element. Otherwise, `leaves` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.***
