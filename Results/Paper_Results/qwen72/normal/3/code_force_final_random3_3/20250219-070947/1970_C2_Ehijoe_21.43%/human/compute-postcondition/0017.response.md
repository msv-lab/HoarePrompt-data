Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. `leaves` is an empty deque.**

The initial state variables `n`, `i`, and `nodes` remain unchanged. The new variable `leaves` is initialized as an empty deque.
