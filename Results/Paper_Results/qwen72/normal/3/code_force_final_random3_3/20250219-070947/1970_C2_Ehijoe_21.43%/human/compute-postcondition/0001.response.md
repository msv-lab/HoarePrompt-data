Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated with the values provided by `input().split()`, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list called `edges`. The values of `n` and `t` are updated based on the input provided, and the dictionary `nodes` and the integer `start` remain unchanged. The list `edges` is now an empty list.
