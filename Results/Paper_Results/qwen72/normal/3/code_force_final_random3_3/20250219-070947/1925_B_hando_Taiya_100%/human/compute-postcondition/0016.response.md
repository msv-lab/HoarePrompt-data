Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, and `i` is 2. If `x % i == 0` and `n` <= `x // 2`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 2`. If `x % i == 0` and `n` > `x // 2`, `ans` remains the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 1` if `x` is divisible by 1 and `n` <= `x // 1`. If neither `x % i == 0` nor `n` <= `x // 2`, `ans` remains 0.***
