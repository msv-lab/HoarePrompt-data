To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the precondition and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(i \leq \text{isqrt}(x)\). Here, `isqrt(x)` is the integer square root of `x`, which is the largest integer `i` such that \(i^2 \leq x\).

2. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the maximum value of all divisors `i` of `x` for which either \(n \leq \frac{x}{i}\) or \(n \leq i\).

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - First, we need to find all divisors of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, we check if \(n \leq \frac{x}{i}\) or \(n \leq i\).
   - We keep track of the maximum divisor `i` that satisfies either of these conditions.

4. **Understanding the Conditions:**
   - \(n \leq \frac{x}{i}\) means that `n` is less than or equal to the quotient when `x` is divided by `i`.
   - \(n \leq i\) means that `n` is less than or equal to the divisor `i` itself.

5. **Finding the Maximum Divisor:**
   - We iterate through all divisors of `x` up to `isqrt(x)`, and for each divisor `i`, we check the conditions.
   - If either condition is satisfied, we update `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`.

6. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum divisor `i` of `x` that satisfies either \(n \leq \frac{x}{i}\) or \(n \leq i\).

Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the maximum divisor `i` of `x` that meets the specified criteria.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor of x such that n <= x // i or n <= i)**
