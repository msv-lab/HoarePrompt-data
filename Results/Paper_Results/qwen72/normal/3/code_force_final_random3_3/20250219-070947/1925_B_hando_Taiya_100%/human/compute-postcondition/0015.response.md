Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` remains an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` remains an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, and `i` remains 2. If `n` <= `x // 2`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 1` if `x` is divisible by 1 and `n` <= `x // 1`. If neither condition is met, `ans` remains 0.***
