Reasoning:

The program aims to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset that can be created by breaking a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The program iterates over all divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n` can be divided into sub-problems with difficulty `i` or `x // i`.
   - It updates `ans` to the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the condition `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Divisors and GCD**:
  - The GCD of `n` sub-problems must be a divisor of `x`.
  - The program correctly identifies all divisors of `x` up to the square root and checks the conditions for both `i` and `x // i`.

- **Optimality**:
  - The program ensures that the maximum possible GCD is found by iterating over all divisors and updating `ans` accordingly.
  - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the sub-problems can be formed with the given divisor.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - For `n = x`, the only possible sub-problems are `1` each, so the GCD is `1`.
  - For `n = 1`, the GCD is `x` itself.
  - For other values of `n`, the program correctly finds the maximum GCD.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
  - Divisors of `10` are `1, 2, 5, 10`.
  - Possible sub-problems: `(4, 2, 4)` with GCD `2`.
  - The program correctly outputs `2`.

- **Test Case 2**: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
  - Divisors of `5` are `1, 5`.
  - The only possible sub-problems are `(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)` with GCD `1`.
  - The program correctly outputs `1`.

- **Test Case 3**: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
  - Divisors of `420` include `6`.
  - Possible sub-problems: `69` sub-problems each with difficulty `6` (since `420 // 69 = 6`).
  - The program correctly outputs `6`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the problemset. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given examples.
