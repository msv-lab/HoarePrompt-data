Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 3. If `n <= 3` and `x % 3 == 0` and `n <= x // 3`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 3`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
