The code snippet `x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads input from the user, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these values to `x` and `n` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `x`, and `n` are no longer relevant after this assignment, and the new values of `x` and `n` are determined by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers based on user input, where 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.**
