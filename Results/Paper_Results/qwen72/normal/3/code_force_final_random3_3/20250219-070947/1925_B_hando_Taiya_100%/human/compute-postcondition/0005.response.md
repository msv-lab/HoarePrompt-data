Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `i`, `i` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the value of `i`. Since `i` is 1 and `ans` was initially 0, `ans` is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
