The code snippet `ans = max(ans, x // i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `x // i`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x
- `i` is 2
- If `n` <= `x // 2`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 1` if `x` is divisible by 1 and `n` <= `x // 1`. If neither condition is met, `ans` remains 0.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and 2 if `n` <= `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 1` if `x` is divisible by 1 and `n` <= `x // 1`. If neither condition is met, `ans` remains 0.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The expression `x // i` calculates the integer division of `x` by `i` (which is 2).
   - `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // 2`.

3. **Output State:**
   - `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
   - `x` remains an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8.
   - `n` remains an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `ans` is now the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 2, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // 2`.**
