Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`) and `n` <= `x // i`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
