Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is equal to `x`. According to the problem description, if `n` is equal to `x`, the only way to break up the problem is to have `n` sub-problems each with a difficulty of 1, which results in a balance of 1. However, the current implementation does not account for this specific edge case. 

For example, if the input is:
```
1
5 5
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program will output `5`, which is incorrect. The program should check if `n` is equal to `x` and handle this case appropriately.
