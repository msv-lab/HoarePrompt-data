The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9. `b` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9.

However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters. Assuming the function should include these parameters, the corrected function signature would be:

```
def func(t, n, a, b):
```

Output:
- Case_1: If `t` is less than 0 or greater than 100, or if `n` is less than 1 or greater than 100, the function returns an error message indicating invalid input.
- Case_2: If the lists `a` and `b` are not of length `n` or are not sorted in non-decreasing order, the function returns an error message indicating invalid input.
- Case_3: Otherwise, the function returns a result based on the valid inputs `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. It returns an error message if `t` is not within the range 1 to 100, or if `n` is not within the range 1 to 100, or if the lists `a` and `b` are not of length `n` or are not sorted in non-decreasing order. If all inputs are valid, the function returns a result based on the inputs `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
