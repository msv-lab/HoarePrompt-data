Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user in the current line, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
