Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user in the current line, `cnt` is either 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, or 0 if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`. `i` is 0 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, or 1 if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`. `j` remains 0 in both cases.***
