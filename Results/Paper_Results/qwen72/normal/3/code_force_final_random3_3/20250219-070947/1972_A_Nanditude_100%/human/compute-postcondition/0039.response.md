The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user in the current line, `j` is 2. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is 2 and `i` is 0. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 1. If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i-1]`, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 2. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i-1]`, `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 1.**
