The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`. `i` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= i <= n - start_index`, where `n` is the length of the array `arr`. `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index < n`. `arr` is a list of integers. `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed.

Case_1: If certain conditions are met, the function returns `None`.

Case_2: If the conditions for Case_1 are not met, the function returns nothing (i.e., it does not return any value explicitly).

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs operations based on the constraints of `i`, `start_index`, and the list `arr`. If certain conditions are met, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it does not return any value.**
