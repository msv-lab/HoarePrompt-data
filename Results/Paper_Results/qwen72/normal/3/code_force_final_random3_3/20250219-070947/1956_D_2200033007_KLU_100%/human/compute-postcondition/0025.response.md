To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 < i - 1 \leq n - \text{start_index}\)
   - `j` is `i`
   - `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq \text{start_index} < n\)
   - `arr` is a list of integers
   - `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed and now includes \((\text{start_index}, \text{start_index} + i)\)
   - `is_already_stairs` is `False`
   - `arr[\text{start_index} + i - 1]` is not equal to `i - 1`
   - The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):`
   - This loop will execute if the range `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` is valid and non-empty.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `start_index` must be less than `start_index + i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is a non-negative integer and \(0 < i - 1\), it follows that \(i \geq 1\).
   - Therefore, `start_index + i + 1` will always be greater than `start_index` as long as `i` is at least 1.
   - The variable `j` should be initialized to `start_index` at the start of the loop.

4. **Final State:**
   - `i` must be at least 1.
   - `start_index` must be a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq \text{start_index} < n\).
   - `j` must be initialized to `start_index`.

State: **`i` is at least 1, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq \text{start_index} < n\), `j` is `start_index`, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed and now includes \((\text{start_index}, \text{start_index} + i)\), `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr[\text{start_index} + i - 1]` is not equal to `i - 1`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called.**
