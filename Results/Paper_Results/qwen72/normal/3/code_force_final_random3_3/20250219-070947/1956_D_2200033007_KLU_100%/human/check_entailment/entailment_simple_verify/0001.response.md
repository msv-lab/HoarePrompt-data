### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX.
   - The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The goal is to achieve this with no more than \( 5 \cdot 10^5 \) operations.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX calculation is crucial for the correctness of the program.
   - The MEX of a subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \) should be the smallest integer from 0 to \( r - l + 1 \) that is not in the subarray.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach with memoization to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \).
   - `func_1` is designed to compute the maximum sum for the subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \) and store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - `func_2` constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - The function correctly uses memoization to store results of subproblems.
     - For a subarray of length 1, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element itself, which is correct.
     - The function attempts to compute the maximum sum by considering different splits of the subarray and the MEX of the subarray.
     - However, the MEX calculation is incorrect. The function uses a formula that does not correctly compute the MEX. It should find the smallest non-negative integer not in the subarray, but it uses a different formula that does not achieve this.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
     - It calls `func_1` to get the maximum sum for the subarray.
     - It then tries to find the optimal split that achieves this sum and recursively constructs the operations for the split subarrays.
     - The function is based on the incorrect MEX calculation from `func_1`, which leads to incorrect operations.

   - **`make_stairs`**:
     - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" pattern where the elements are \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots, i \).
     - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase pattern.
     - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and applies the MEX operation.
     - The function does not correctly handle the transformation and MEX calculation, leading to incorrect results.

5. **MEX Calculation Error**:
   - The MEX calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the program uses a different formula that does not correctly compute the MEX.
   - This error propagates to `func_2` and `make_stairs`, causing the entire program to produce incorrect results.

6. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX, which is a fundamental part of the problem.
   - The operations and the maximum sum calculated by the program are based on the incorrect MEX calculation, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the MEX, which is essential for the problem. Therefore, the operations and the maximum sum calculated by the program are incorrect.

Final: **False**
