Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the MEX operation as described in the problem. The function `func_1` seems to be trying to maximize the sum of the array by recursively breaking down the array and calculating potential sums, but it does not actually compute the MEX of any subarray. The MEX operation is crucial to the problem, and without it, the program cannot achieve the correct solution. For example, consider the input:

```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The correct output should be:

```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

However, the given program does not compute the MEX of the subarray [2] or [2, 1], and thus it will not produce the correct sequence of operations or the correct maximum sum.
