Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < i <= n - start_index, `j` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed, and `is_already_stairs` is `False`. If `arr[start_index + i] == i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < i - 1 <= n - start_index, `j` is `start_index + i + 1`, `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i - 1]` are all equal to `i - 1`, `res` includes `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`, and `arr[start_index + i - 2]` is not equal to `i - 2`.***
