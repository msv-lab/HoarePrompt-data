Postcondition: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i <= n - start_index, `j` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed, and `is_already_stairs` is `True`. All elements in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` are equal to their respective indices (i.e., `arr[start_index + k] == k` for all `k` in the range 0 to `i`).**
