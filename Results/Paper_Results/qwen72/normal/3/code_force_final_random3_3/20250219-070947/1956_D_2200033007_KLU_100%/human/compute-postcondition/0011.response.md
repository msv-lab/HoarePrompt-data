Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i <= n - start_index, `j` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed. If any element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is not equal to its index (i.e., `arr[start_index + k] != k` for any `k` in the range 0 to `i`), then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` remains a non-negative integer within the range specified initially. The variable `j` will be equal to `i`, indicating that the loop has completed its full range of iterations. The `start_index` and `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `is_already_stairs` will be `False` if any element in the subarray from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) does not match its index. If all elements in this subarray match their respective indices, `is_already_stairs` will remain `True`.
