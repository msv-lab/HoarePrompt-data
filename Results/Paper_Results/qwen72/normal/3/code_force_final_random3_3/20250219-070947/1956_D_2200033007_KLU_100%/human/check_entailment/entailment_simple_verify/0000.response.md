Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The primary issue with the provided program is that it does not correctly implement the MEX operation, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem. The function `func_1` attempts to maximize the sum of the array through a recursive approach, but it does not compute the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it uses a heuristic that does not align with the problem's constraints and objectives. This results in incorrect outputs for cases where the MEX operation is necessary to achieve the maximum sum.

For example, in the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the program does not compute the MEX of the subarray [2] or [2, 1], and thus it will not produce the correct sequence of operations or the correct maximum sum.

The function `make_stairs` also seems to be an attempt to transform a subarray into a specific pattern, but it does not align with the MEX operation as required by the problem. The function `func_2` relies on `func_1` to determine the sequence of operations, which is flawed due to the incorrect MEX computation in `func_1`.

Final: **False**
