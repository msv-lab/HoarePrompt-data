Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 < i <= n - start_index, `j` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed, `is_already_stairs` is `False` because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is not equal to its index, `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**

The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, which will affect the state of the program depending on the implementation of `make_stairs`. However, without the details of `make_stairs`, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. The initial state remains valid, and the function call is now part of the program's execution.
