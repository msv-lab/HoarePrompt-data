Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i <= n - start_index, `j` is 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is `False`. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains `True`.***
