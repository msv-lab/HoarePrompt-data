You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array \( a \) of length \( n \) (where \( 1 \le n \le 18 \)).
   - We can perform an operation that replaces a subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \) with the MEX of the subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements after performing the operations.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - For a subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \), the MEX can be calculated by finding the smallest integer from 0 to \( r - l + 1 \) that is not in the subarray.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
   - `func_1` computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \) after performing the operations.
   - `func_2` constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function is designed to compute the maximum sum for the subarray \( a[l \ldots r] \).
     - It uses memoization to store results of subproblems in `res_dict`.
     - If the subarray length is 1, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element itself.
     - It recursively computes the sum by considering different splits of the subarray and the MEX of the subarray.
     - The function does not correctly compute the MEX; it should find the smallest non-negative integer not in the subarray, but it uses a different formula.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
     - It calls `func_1` to get the maximum sum for the subarray.
     - It then tries to find the optimal split that achieves this sum and recursively constructs the operations for the split subarrays.
     - The function does not correctly handle the MEX calculation, which is crucial for the operations.

   - **`make_stairs`**:
     - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" pattern where the elements are \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots, i \).
     - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase pattern.
     - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and applies the MEX operation.
     - The function does not correctly handle the transformation and MEX calculation.

5. **MEX Calculation Error**:
   - The MEX calculation in the program is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, but the program uses a different formula that does not correctly compute the MEX.

6. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX, which is a fundamental part of the problem.
   - The operations constructed by `func_2` and `make_stairs` are based on the incorrect MEX calculation, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the MEX, which is essential for the problem. Therefore, the operations and the maximum sum calculated by the program are incorrect.
