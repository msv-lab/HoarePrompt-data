Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `cases` where `t` is the number of test cases and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.**
