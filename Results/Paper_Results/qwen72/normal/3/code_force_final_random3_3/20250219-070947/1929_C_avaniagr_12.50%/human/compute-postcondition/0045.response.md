The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `x` must still be at least 1 for the loop condition to be satisfied.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `k` is an integer provided by the user, `x` must be at least 1, `a` is an integer provided by the user, `z` is 2, `i` is 2**
