Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers input by the user, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` but not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x`, and `x + 1` is greater than `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `a` is less than `z`, then `a` is less than `x + 1`.***
