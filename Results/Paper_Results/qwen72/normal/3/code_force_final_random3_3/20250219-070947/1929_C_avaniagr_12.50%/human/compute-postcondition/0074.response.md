Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 2.
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `z` is the result of the loop.
- `i` is `x`.
- `a` is less than `z`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the print statement is not dependent on any of these variables. It just prints a constant string.

Output: **NO**
