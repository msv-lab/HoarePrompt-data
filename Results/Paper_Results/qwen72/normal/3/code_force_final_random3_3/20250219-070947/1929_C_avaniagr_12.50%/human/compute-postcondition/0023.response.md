Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, but `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is 3, `i` is 2, `x + 1` must be greater than 2**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated by the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
- Initially, `z` is 2.
- The expression `z // (k - 1)` performs integer division of `z` by `k - 1`.
- Since `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` but not equal to `k - 1`, `k - 1` must be a positive integer.
- Therefore, `2 // (k - 1)` will be 0 for any `k - 1` greater than 2, and 1 for `k - 1` equal to 2.
- Adding 1 to the result of the integer division, we get `z += 0 + 1` or `z += 1 + 1`, which results in `z` being 3.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `x + 1` must be greater than 2 still holds true.
