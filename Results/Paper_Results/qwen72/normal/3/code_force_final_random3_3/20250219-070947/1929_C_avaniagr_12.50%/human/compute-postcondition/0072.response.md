Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2.
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `z` is the result of the loop.
- `i` is `x`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement itself.
- The condition that `a` is greater than or equal to `z` is given, but it does not affect the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
