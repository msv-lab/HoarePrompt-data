### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We need to create a graph where an edge exists between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`**
     - It calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`.
     - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`.
     - It iterates over the range of `cliques` and calls `make_array` for each clique.
     - Finally, it prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.

   - **Function 2: `make_array(left, right, clique)`**
     - This function is responsible for assigning values to the vertices within a specific range.
     - It calculates the number of small elements and big elements to be assigned.
     - It assigns the small elements from `left` to `left + mid - 1` and the big elements from `left + mid` to `right`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Clique Calculation:**
     - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. This is correct because each clique can have at most `k` vertices.
   - **Value Assignment:**
     - The function `make_array` assigns values to the vertices in a way that ensures the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) is met.
     - It assigns small elements in increasing order and big elements in decreasing order within the range.
   - **Clique Assignment:**
     - The function `make_array` also assigns the same clique number to all vertices within the range, which is correct for forming a clique.

4. **Edge Case Analysis:**
   - **Single Clique:**
     - If \(k \ge n\), the entire graph can be a single clique. The program handles this by assigning all vertices to the same clique.
   - **Multiple Cliques:**
     - If \(k < n\), the program divides the vertices into multiple cliques, each of size at most `k`. This is correct as it ensures the minimum number of cliques.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.
   - The assigned values are distinct and within the range [1, n].
   - The number of cliques is correct.
   - The clique assignments ensure that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - **State Before `func_1` Call:**
     - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \le n \le 40\) and \(1 \le k \le 2n\).
   - **State After `make_array` Call in `func_1`:**
     - `i` is `cliques - 1`, `cliques` is the ceiling of `n / k`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each block of `k` elements (or the remaining elements if less than `k`) is set to the corresponding `i + 1` value, and `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - **State After `make_array` Loop in `func_1`:**
     - `arr` is correctly filled with distinct integers from 1 to n.
     - `cliquess` is correctly filled with the corresponding clique numbers.
   - **State After `make_array` Call in `make_array`:**
     - `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left <= right`, and `clique` is a positive integer.
     - `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, and `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.
     - The values are assigned correctly to `arr` and `cliquess`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly assigns values to the vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem description. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program should work for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
