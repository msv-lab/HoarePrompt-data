The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `not_mid`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `not_mid` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `not_mid` must still be greater than `i`.

Given that `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` and it must be greater than 0, and `i` is 1, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2.
- `not_mid` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than 2), `i` is 2, `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `arr[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`, and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `clique`.**
