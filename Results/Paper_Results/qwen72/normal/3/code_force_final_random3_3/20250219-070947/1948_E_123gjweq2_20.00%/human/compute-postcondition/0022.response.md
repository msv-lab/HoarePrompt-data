The code snippet `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique` updates the value of the element in the `cliquess` list at the index `left + mid + i` to `clique`. Given that `i` is 2, this means the element at the index `left + mid + 2` is updated to `clique`. 

Since `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` was already `clique`, the value at `left + mid + 2` was already `clique` before the update. Therefore, this code snippet does not change the state of the program.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than 2), `i` is 2, `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `arr[left + mid + i]` for `i` = 2 is `big_element - 2`, `arr[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` except `i` = 2 is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`, and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `clique`.**
