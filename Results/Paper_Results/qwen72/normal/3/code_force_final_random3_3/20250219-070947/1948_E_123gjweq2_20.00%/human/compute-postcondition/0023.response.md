Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than or equal to 0), `i` is `not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `arr[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`, and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `clique`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- `left` and `right` are still non-negative integers, with `left` being less than `right`.
- `clique` remains a positive integer.
- `small_element` is still `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is still `right + 1`.
- `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`, and it must be greater than 0.
- `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`, and it must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `not_mid - 1`, which is the last index of the loop's range.
- The array `arr` has been modified such that:
  - For all indices `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]`, `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i`.
  - For all indices `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i`.
- The array `cliquess` has been modified such that:
  - For all indices `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.
  - For all indices `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.

In essence, the loop has filled the portion of `arr` from `left + mid` to `right` with values starting from `big_element` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent index. Similarly, the corresponding portion of `cliquess` has been set to `clique` for all indices in the range `[left + mid, right]`. The initial portion of `arr` and `cliquess` (from `left` to `left + mid - 1`) remains unchanged.
