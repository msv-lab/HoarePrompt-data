You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Annotated Code:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)

    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: `i` is `cliques - 1`, `cliques` is the ceiling of `n / k`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each block of `k` elements (or the remaining elements if less than `k`) is set to the corresponding `i + 1` value, and `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros.

    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. The function then creates a list `arr` of `n` integers, where each block of `k` elements (or the remaining elements if less than `k`) is set to the corresponding `i + 1` value, where `i` is the index of the block. The function prints the list `arr`, the number of cliques, and a list `cliquess` of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are non-negative integers such that left <= right, and clique is a positive integer.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `left` and `right` remain non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is still a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `i` is `mid - 1`, `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, and `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` (which must be greater than 0), `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid` (which must be greater than or equal to 0), `i` is `not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `arr[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is `clique`, and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, not_mid - 1]` is `clique`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` ≤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function populates an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` with specific values. After the function concludes, `arr` contains a sequence of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in a specific pattern: the first half of the range from `left` to `left + mid - 1` is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the second half from `left + mid` to `right` is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1` and moving backwards. The `cliquess` array is filled with the value of `clique` for all indices from `left` to `right`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` in place.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case when `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. According to the problem description, if `k >= n`, the graph can be partitioned into a single clique, as the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` will always be satisfied for any pair of vertices. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not account for this and will still try to partition the graph into multiple cliques, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
8 16
```
The expected output should be:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
However, the current program will output:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
2
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2
```
This output is incorrect because the graph can be partitioned into a single clique, but the program partitions it into two cliques.
