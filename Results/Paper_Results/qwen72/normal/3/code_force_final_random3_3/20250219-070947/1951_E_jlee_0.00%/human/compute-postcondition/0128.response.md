Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character.
- `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is 2, `done` remains False, and `count2` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `count`, `done`, and `count2` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `j - 1`:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - Therefore, `j - 1` is 1.

2. **Determine the substrings to be printed:**
   - `string[:j - 1]` will be `string[:1]`, which is the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the character at index 1.
   - `string[j - 1:]` will be `string[1:]`, which is the substring from the character at index 1 to the end of `string`.

3. **Output the substrings:**
   - `string[:1]` is the first character of `string`.
   - `string[1:]` is the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string] [rest of string starting from the second character]**

For example, if `string` is "hello":
Output: **h ello**
