Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is 0, `count2` is 0, `count` is 1, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n - 1]`, `done` is True. Otherwise, `done` remains False.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
