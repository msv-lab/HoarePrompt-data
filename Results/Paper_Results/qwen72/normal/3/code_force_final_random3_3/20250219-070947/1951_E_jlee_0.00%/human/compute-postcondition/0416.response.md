To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
   - `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` must be at least 3.
   - `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `count` is a variable that is incremented by 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.
   - `done` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - The code snippet provided is simply `print('YES')`.
   - This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
   - The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, or `done`.

3. **Output:**
   - Since the `print` statement is a simple constant string, the output will always be 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
