Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by reading a string `string`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the string length `n` is 1, the function correctly prints 'NO' because a single character string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different (`x != s[-1]`), the function correctly prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the function correctly prints 'NO' because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.
   - If all but one character in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), the function checks if the middle character (for odd-length strings) is different from `x`. If it is, the function prints 'NO' because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.

3. **General Case**:
   - The function iterates through the first half of the string to check for the first and last characters that are different. If such characters are found, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - If the string has more complex patterns, the function uses `count` and `count2` to track positions where characters differ from the first and last characters. It then tries to split the string into two non-palindromic substrings based on these positions.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the function prints either 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the appropriate number of substrings and the substrings themselves.
   - The function correctly handles the output format as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases and Complex Patterns**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where the string is very short or has a simple pattern.
   - For more complex patterns, the function attempts to find a valid partition by checking for the first and last differing characters and using additional logic to split the string.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The function processes each string in linear time, which is efficient given the constraints (sum of string lengths does not exceed \(10^6\)).

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
