Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
   - `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1.
   - `x` is the first character of the new list `s`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count2` is equal to `count`.
   - `count` is greater than 1.
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - If `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n - 1]`, `done` is True. Otherwise, `done` remains False.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will always output the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is always `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
