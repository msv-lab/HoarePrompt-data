Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, and `j` is 2. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` > 1, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count` and `count` â‰¤ 1, `count` is incremented by 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, and `done` is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
