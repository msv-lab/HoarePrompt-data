Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `x` is not equal to the last character of the list `s`, the count of `x` in the list `s` is `n - 1`, and the count of `x` in the list `s` is not equal to `n`. If `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` (i.e., `s[(n - 1) // 2]`) is not equal to `x`, then the middle element is not `x`. Otherwise, either `n` is even, or the middle element of `s` is `x`.** 

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.
