Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
- `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 3.
- `x` is the first character of the new list `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- `count` is 0 or greater.

The condition states that if `s[j]` (which is `s[2]`) is not equal to `x` (which is `s[0]`) and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is updated to 2 and `done` is set to True. Otherwise, `count` and `done` remain unchanged.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **YES**
