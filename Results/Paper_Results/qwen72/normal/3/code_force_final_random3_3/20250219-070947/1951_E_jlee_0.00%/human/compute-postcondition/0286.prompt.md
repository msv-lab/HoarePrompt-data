Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s`, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is 0, and `count` is 0 or greater. If `count` > 0, then: if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is 0 and `done` remains False; if `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is 1 and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n - 1]`, otherwise `done` remains False; if `count2` is a positive integer less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `count2` is equal to `count`, `count2` is set to `count` and `done` is True if `count` > 1; if `count` is 1, `count2` is set to 0, and `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n - 1]`, otherwise `done` remains False; if `count2` is not equal to `count`, `count2` is 0 and `done` remains False; if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is 0, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is 0 or greater, and `done` is a boolean. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` equals `count` and `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is not equal to `count` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is not equal to `count` and `count2` is less than or equal to `count`, `done` remains unchanged. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1. If `count` is 0, `count` is set to 1 and `done` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the new list `s` and must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of the new list `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is 0 or greater. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is updated to 2 and `done` is set to True. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1 and `done` remains unchanged. If `count` is 0 or less, `count` and `done` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
