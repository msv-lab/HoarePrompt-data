Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is a new input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0 or greater, and `done` is False. If `n` is 1, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the program continues with the current values of the variables. If `s.count(x) == n`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the program continues with the current values of the variables.**
