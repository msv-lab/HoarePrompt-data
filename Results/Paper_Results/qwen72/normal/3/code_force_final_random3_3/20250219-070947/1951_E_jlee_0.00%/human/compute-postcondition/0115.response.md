Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print(string)` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character.
- `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- `count` is a variable that is initially less than 1.
- `count2` is 0 or 1 if `count` > 0.
- `done` is a boolean variable that is determined by the following conditions:
  - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, or if `count2` == `count` and `count` > 1, or if `count2` > `count`.
  - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True.
  - If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` was initially less than 1, `count` is set to 1.
  - Otherwise, `done` remains False.
- If `count` <= 0, `done` remains False and `count2` is 0.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
   - `string` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 3.
   - `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `count` is initially less than 1.
   - `count2` is 0 or 1 if `count` > 0.
   - `done` is determined by the conditions provided.

2. **Conditions and Their Impact:**
   - The conditions for `done` are complex and depend on the values of `s[j]`, `x`, `count`, and `count2`.
   - However, the `print(string)` statement does not depend on any of these conditions or variables. It simply prints the input string `string`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(string)` statement will print the input string `string` as it is, regardless of the values of the other variables or the conditions described.

### Final Output:
Output: **string (where string is the input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters)**
