You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 500`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `l` (which is not necessarily the same as `n`), where `2 <= l <= 100`, and a list of `l` integers, each between `1` and `10^9`. It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list and prints this difference. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the differences between the maximum and minimum values of each list have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(l\) and the array elements \(nums\).
   - The program then initializes two variables \(x\) and \(y\) to store the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively.
   - It iterates through the array to find the maximum value \(x\) and the minimum value \(y\).
   - Finally, it prints the difference \(x - y\).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not sort the array, which is a critical step to maximize the beauty of the array.
   - The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). By sorting the array, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.
   - The program only finds the maximum and minimum values and prints their difference, which is not the correct approach to calculate the maximum beauty of the array.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with array \([2, 1, 3]\):
     - The correct approach would be to sort the array to \([1, 2, 3]\).
     - The beauty would be \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\).
     - The program, however, calculates \(x = 3\) and \(y = 1\) and prints \(3 - 1 = 2\), which is coincidentally correct but for the wrong reason.
   - For the second test case with array \([69, 69, 69]\):
     - The correct beauty is 0 because all elements are the same.
     - The program calculates \(x = 69\) and \(y = 69\) and prints \(69 - 69 = 0\), which is correct but again for the wrong reason.
   - For the third test case with array \([100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\):
     - The correct approach would be to sort the array to \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\).
     - The beauty would be \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\).
     - The program calculates \(x = 100\) and \(y = 43\) and prints \(100 - 43 = 57\), which is correct but for the wrong reason.
   - For the fourth test case with array \([3, 4, 3, 3]\):
     - The correct approach would be to sort the array to \([3, 3, 3, 4]\).
     - The beauty would be \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\).
     - The program calculates \(x = 4\) and \(y = 3\) and prints \(4 - 3 = 1\), which is correct but for the wrong reason.
   - For the fifth test case with array \([2, 1]\):
     - The correct approach would be to sort the array to \([1, 2]\).
     - The beauty would be \((2 - 1) = 1\).
     - The program calculates \(x = 2\) and \(y = 1\) and prints \(2 - 1 = 1\), which is correct but for the wrong reason.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the correct approach to solve the problem. It only finds the maximum and minimum values and prints their difference, which is not the same as calculating the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the elements and summing the differences. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
