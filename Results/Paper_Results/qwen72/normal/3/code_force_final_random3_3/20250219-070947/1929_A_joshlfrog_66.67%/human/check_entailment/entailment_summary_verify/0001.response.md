### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we need to sort the array in ascending order. This is because sorting the array ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are minimized, and the sum of these differences is maximized.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(l\) and the array elements \(nums\).
   - The program then initializes two variables \(x\) and \(y\) to store the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively.
   - It iterates through the array to find the maximum value \(x\) and the minimum value \(y\).
   - Finally, it prints the difference \(x - y\).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not sort the array, which is a critical step to maximize the beauty of the array.
   - The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). By sorting the array, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.
   - The program only finds the maximum and minimum values and prints their difference, which is not the correct approach to calculate the maximum beauty of the array.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with array \([2, 1, 3]\):
     - The correct approach would be to sort the array to \([1, 2, 3]\).
     - The beauty would be \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\).
     - The program, however, calculates \(x = 3\) and \(y = 1\) and prints \(3 - 1 = 2\), which is coincidentally correct but for the wrong reason.
   - For the second test case with array \([69, 69, 69]\):
     - The correct beauty is 0 because all elements are the same.
     - The program calculates \(x = 69\) and \(y = 69\) and prints \(69 - 69 = 0\), which is correct but again for the wrong reason.
   - For the third test case with array \([100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\):
     - The correct approach would be to sort the array to \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\).
     - The beauty would be \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\).
     - The program calculates \(x = 100\) and \(y = 43\) and prints \(100 - 43 = 57\), which is correct but for the wrong reason.
   - For the fourth test case with array \([3, 4, 3, 3]\):
     - The correct approach would be to sort the array to \([3, 3, 3, 4]\).
     - The beauty would be \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\).
     - The program calculates \(x = 4\) and \(y = 3\) and prints \(4 - 3 = 1\), which is correct but for the wrong reason.
   - For the fifth test case with array \([2, 1]\):
     - The correct approach would be to sort the array to \([1, 2]\).
     - The beauty would be \((2 - 1) = 1\).
     - The program calculates \(x = 2\) and \(y = 1\) and prints \(2 - 1 = 1\), which is correct but for the wrong reason.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the correct approach to solve the problem. It only finds the maximum and minimum values and prints their difference, which is not the same as calculating the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the elements and summing the differences. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
