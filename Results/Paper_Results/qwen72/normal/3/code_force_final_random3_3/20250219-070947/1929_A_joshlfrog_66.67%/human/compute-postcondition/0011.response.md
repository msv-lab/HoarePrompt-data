Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `y` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `nums[i]` is less than the previous value of `y`. If `nums[0]` is greater than 0, `x` is set to the value of `nums[0]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0.**
