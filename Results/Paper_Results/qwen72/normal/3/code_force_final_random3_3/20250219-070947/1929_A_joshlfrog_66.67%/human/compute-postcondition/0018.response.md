The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `l` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `l` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, and `y` is 100000000 or the value of `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is less than 100000000. `x` is 0 if `nums[1]` is not greater than 0 or not greater than `x`; otherwise, `x` is set to `nums[1]`.**
