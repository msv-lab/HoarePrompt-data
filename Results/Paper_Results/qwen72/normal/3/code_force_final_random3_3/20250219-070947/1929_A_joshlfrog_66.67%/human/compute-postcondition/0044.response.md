Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is either 100000000 or the value of `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` (whichever is smaller). If `nums[2]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to the value of `nums[2]`. If `nums[2]` > the previous value of `x`, then `x` is updated to the value of `nums[2]`. Otherwise, `x` remains the value of `nums[0]` or `nums[1]` (whichever is greater and > 0), or 0 if no such value exists.***
