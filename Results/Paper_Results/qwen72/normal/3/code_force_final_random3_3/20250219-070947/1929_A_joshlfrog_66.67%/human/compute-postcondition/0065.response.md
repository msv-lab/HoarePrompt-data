Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 2, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1. If `nums[0]` < `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[1]`. `x` is the maximum of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` if both are positive, otherwise `x` remains 0. If `nums[0]` is not less than `y`, then `y` retains its original value, which is `nums[0]`, and `x` is the maximum of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` if both are positive, otherwise `x` remains 0.***
