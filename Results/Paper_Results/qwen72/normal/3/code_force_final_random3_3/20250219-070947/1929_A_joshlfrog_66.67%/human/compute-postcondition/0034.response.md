Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, and `y` is 100000000. If `nums[0]` > 0, then `x` is set to the value of `nums[0]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y`.**
