Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `y` is 100000000. If `nums[1]` is greater than 0 and `nums[1]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to the value of `nums[1]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0.***
