Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, and `y` is the minimum value in the new `nums`.**

The value of `x` has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specified that `x` was the maximum value in the new `nums`, but after the code execution, `x` is now 0. The value of `y` is still the minimum value in the new `nums`.
