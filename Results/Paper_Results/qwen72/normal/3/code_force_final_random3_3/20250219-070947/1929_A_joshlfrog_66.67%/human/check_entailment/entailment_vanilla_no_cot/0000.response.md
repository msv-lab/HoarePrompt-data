Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The program, however, only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference, which is not the correct approach.

To maximize the beauty of the array, you should sort the array in ascending order and then compute the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the sorted array will have the smallest possible differences between consecutive elements, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.

Here is the correct approach:

1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the length of the array and the array itself.
   - Sort the array.
   - Compute the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - Print the result.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, l))
        print(beauty)
```

This program will correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.
