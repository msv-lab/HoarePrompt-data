Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. It only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize the beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
3
1 3 2
4
3 4 3 3
```

Expected output:
```
2
1
```

Actual output from the given program:
```
2
1
```

While the actual output matches the expected output for the first test case, it fails for the second test case. The correct maximum beauty for the second test case can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, which gives a beauty of `(4-3) + (3-4) + (3-3) = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0`. However, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
