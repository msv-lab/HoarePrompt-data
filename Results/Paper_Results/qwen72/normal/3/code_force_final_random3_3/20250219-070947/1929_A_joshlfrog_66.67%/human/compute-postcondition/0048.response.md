Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
- `e` is 1.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is `l - 1`.
- `x` is the maximum value in `nums`.
- `y` is the minimum value in `nums`.

The `print(x - y)` statement will print the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `x - y`. However, the output will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
