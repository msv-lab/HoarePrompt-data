Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x` as they are at the point of execution. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `x` and `y`, we can only describe them based on the given information.

Output: **y, x (where y and x are the input integers, and x is greater than 1)**
