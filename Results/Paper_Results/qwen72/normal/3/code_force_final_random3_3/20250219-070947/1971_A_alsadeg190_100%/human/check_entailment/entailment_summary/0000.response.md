Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases `x` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints them in ascending order. The logic for determining the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` is correct: if `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`; otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. This matches the problem description and the expected output format.

However, there is a minor issue in the variable naming. The variable `x` is reused for both the number of test cases and the first integer in each test case. This can lead to confusion, but in this specific context, it does not affect the correctness of the program because the scope of the outer `x` (number of test cases) is not used inside the loop.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
