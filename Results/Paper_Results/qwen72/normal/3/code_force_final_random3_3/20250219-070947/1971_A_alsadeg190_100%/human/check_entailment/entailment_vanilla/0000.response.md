### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` is defined to handle the problem.
   - The first input is read as an integer `x`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - A loop is then set up to run `x` times, each time reading a pair of integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - Inside the loop, the input is split by spaces and converted to a list of integers.
   - The variables `x` and `y` are then assigned the values from this list.

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program checks if `x` is less than `y`.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` and `y` are equal, as it will print the same number twice, which is correct.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `x` and `y` are within the valid range (0 to 9).

5. **Input and Output Format:**
   - The input format is correctly handled, with the number of test cases read first and then each test case read in the loop.
   - The output format is correct, printing two integers per test case, with the minimum followed by the maximum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case and prints them in the required format. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
