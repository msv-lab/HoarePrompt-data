Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers x and y, where 0 <= x, y <= 9. The number of test cases t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is `x-1`, and `x` must be greater than or equal to `x-1`. If `x` < `y`, no changes are made to `x`, `y`, or `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x`, `y`, or `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `x` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9) from the user. It then prints the two integers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
