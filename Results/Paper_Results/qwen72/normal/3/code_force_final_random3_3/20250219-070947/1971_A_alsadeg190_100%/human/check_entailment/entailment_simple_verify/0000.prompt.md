You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers x and y, where 0 <= x, y <= 9. The number of test cases t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is `x-1`, and `x` must be greater than or equal to `x-1`. If `x` < `y`, no changes are made to `x`, `y`, or `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x`, `y`, or `i`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the given problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. The program works correctly for all potential cases, including when `x` and `y` are equal, and when `x` is either greater than or less than `y`. The constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) and the input format are also correctly handled. Therefore, the program is correct.
