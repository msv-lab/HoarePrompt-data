Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def construct_permutation(t, test_cases):`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `mex` is an empty list. `minn` is 0. `maxx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        minn += 1
        if minn == maxx:
            minn = maxx + 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
            maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either [0] or the value `abs(arr[0] - minn)`, `minn` is either 1 or 0, and `maxx` is either 0 or `abs(arr[0] - minn)`. If `arr[0]` is greater than 0, `mex` is [0], `minn` is 1, and `maxx` is 0. If `arr[0]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is [abs(arr[0] - minn)], `minn` is 0, and `maxx` is either `abs(arr[0] - minn)` if `abs(arr[0] - minn)` is greater than the initial `maxx`, or remains the initial `maxx` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either [0, 1] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), 0] or [0, abs(arr[1] - minn)] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), abs(arr[1] - minn)], `minn` is either 3 or 2 or 1 or 0, and `maxx` is either 0 or `abs(arr[0] - minn)` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`. If `arr[i] > 0`, and `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `mex` is [0, 1], `minn` is 3, and `maxx` is 0. If `arr[i] > 0` and `minn` is not equal to `maxx`, the values of `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` remain unchanged. If `arr[i] <= 0`, then `mex` is [0, abs(arr[1] - minn)] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), abs(arr[1] - minn)], `minn` is 1 or 0, and `maxx` is `abs(arr[1] - minn)` if `abs(arr[1] - minn) > maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains either 0 or `abs(arr[0] - minn)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. If `arr[i] > 0` and `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to 3 and `maxx` is set to 0, and `mex` is set to [0, 1]. If `arr[i] > 0` and `minn` is not equal to `maxx`, the values of `minn`, `maxx`, and `mex` remain unchanged. If `arr[i] <= 0`, then `mex` is updated to include `abs(arr[2] - minn)` as its third element, `minn` is either 3, 2, 1, or 0, and if `abs(arr[2] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[2] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
