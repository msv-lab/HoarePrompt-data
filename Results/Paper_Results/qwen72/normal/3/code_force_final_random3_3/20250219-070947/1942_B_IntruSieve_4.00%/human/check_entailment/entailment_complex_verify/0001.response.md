### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the current minimum and maximum values in the permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates through each element `arr[i]` of the array `a`.
   - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is because if `arr[i]` is positive, it suggests that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `minn`, and the value `p[i]` is `minn - arr[i]`, which is `minn` since `arr[i]` is positive.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary. This is because if `arr[i]` is negative, it suggests that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `p[i] + arr[i]`, and the value `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `mex`, the program prints the elements of `mex`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `arr[i]` is positive by appending the current `minn` and incrementing it.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `arr[i]` is negative by appending `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and updating `maxx` if necessary.
   - The program ensures that the values in `mex` are unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle the edge case where `arr` is all positive or all negative.
   - The program should handle the case where `arr` is a mix of positive and negative values.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.

- **Permutation Construction:**
  - **Positive `arr[i]` Handling:**
    - When `arr[i]` is positive, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is correct because if `arr[i]` is positive, it implies that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `minn`, and `p[i]` is `minn - arr[i]`, which is `minn` since `arr[i]` is positive.
  - **Non-positive `arr[i]` Handling:**
    - When `arr[i]` is non-positive, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary. This is correct because if `arr[i]` is negative, it implies that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `p[i] + arr[i]`, and `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
  - **Unique Values:**
    - The program ensures that the values in `mex` are unique by incrementing `minn` and updating `maxx` as needed. This is crucial for maintaining the permutation property.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the elements of `mex` for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Annotated Code Review:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The function `func_1` is called `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
  - The function should be defined to handle multiple test cases, but the current implementation does not pass `t` or `test_cases` to `func_1`. This is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness of the permutation construction for a single test case.

- **State After Loop:**
  - The `mex` list is correctly constructed based on the conditions in the loop.
  - `minn` and `maxx` are updated correctly to ensure the permutation properties are maintained.

- **Final State:**
  - The `mex` list is printed, and the program moves on to the next test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions. It handles both positive and negative values in `arr` and ensures that the permutation is valid. The minor issue with the function definition does not affect the correctness of the permutation construction for a single test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
