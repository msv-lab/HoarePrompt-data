Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the user. It then constructs a new list `mex` based on the conditions in the loop. For each element in the input list `arr`, if the element is positive, the smallest non-negative integer not yet in `mex` is added to `mex`. If the element is non-positive, the absolute difference between the element and the smallest non-negative integer not yet in `mex` is added to `mex`. After constructing the `mex` list, it prints each element of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline character. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the original `n` and `arr`, the constructed `mex` list, and the updated values of `minn` and `maxx`. **
