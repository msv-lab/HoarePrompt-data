### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the current minimum and maximum values in the permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates through each element `arr[i]` of the array `a`.
   - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is because if `arr[i]` is positive, it suggests that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `minn`, and the value `p[i]` is `minn - arr[i]`, which is `minn` since `arr[i]` is positive.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary. This is because if `arr[i]` is negative, it suggests that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is `p[i] + arr[i]`, and the value `p[i]` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `mex`, the program prints the elements of `mex`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `arr[i]` is positive by appending the current `minn` and incrementing it.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `arr[i]` is negative by appending `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and updating `maxx` if necessary.
   - The program ensures that the values in `mex` are unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle the edge case where `arr` is all positive or all negative.
   - The program should handle the case where `arr` is a mix of positive and negative values.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions. It handles both positive and negative values in `arr` and ensures that the permutation is valid. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
