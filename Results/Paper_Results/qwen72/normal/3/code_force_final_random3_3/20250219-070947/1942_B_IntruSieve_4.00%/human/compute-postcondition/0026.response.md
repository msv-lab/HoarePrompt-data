Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either [0, 1] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), 0] or [0, abs(arr[1] - minn)] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), abs(arr[1] - minn)], `minn` is either 3 or 2 or 1 or 0, and `maxx` is either 0 or `abs(arr[0] - minn)` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`. If `arr[i] > 0`, and `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `mex` is [0, 1], `minn` is 3, and `maxx` is 0. If `arr[i] > 0` and `minn` is not equal to `maxx`, the values of `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` remain unchanged. If `arr[i] <= 0`, then `mex` is [0, abs(arr[1] - minn)] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), abs(arr[1] - minn)], `minn` is 1 or 0, and `maxx` is `abs(arr[1] - minn)` if `abs(arr[1] - minn) > maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains either 0 or `abs(arr[0] - minn)`.**
