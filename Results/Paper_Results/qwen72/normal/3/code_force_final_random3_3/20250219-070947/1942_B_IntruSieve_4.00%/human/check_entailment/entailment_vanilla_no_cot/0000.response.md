Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a` as described in the problem. The logic in the program for calculating the MEX and updating the permutation `p` is flawed. Specifically, the way the `mex` list is being populated and the conditions for updating `minn` and `maxx` do not align with the requirements of the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should work correctly:

```python
def find_permutation(n, a):
    p = []
    seen = set()
    mex = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate p_i based on the formula p_i = MEX(p_1, ..., p_i) - a_i
        p_i = mex - a[i]
        p.append(p_i)
        seen.add(p_i)
        
        # Update the MEX for the next iteration
        while mex in seen:
            mex += 1
    
    return p

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = find_permutation(n, a)
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is the list that will store the permutation.
   - `seen` is a set to keep track of the elements that have already been used in the permutation.
   - `mex` is initialized to 0, which is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set `seen`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - For each element `a_i` in the array `a`, calculate `p_i` using the formula `p_i = mex - a_i`.
   - Add `p_i` to the permutation list `p` and mark it as seen in the set `seen`.
   - Update the MEX by incrementing it until it is not in the set `seen`.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, print the constructed permutation `p`.

This corrected program should correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem's requirements.
