The only objects in the loop head are the variables `itm` and the list `mex`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `mex`. If `mex` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `itm` is the second element in `mex`, and `mex` must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `mex` must have at least three elements, and `itm` will be the third element in `mex`.

State: **`n` is the same as the initial `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `itm` is the third element in `mex`, `minn` is the next integer that has not been added to `mex` or is 0 if all positive integers up to `maxx` have been used, and `maxx` is the maximum value in the `mex` list**
