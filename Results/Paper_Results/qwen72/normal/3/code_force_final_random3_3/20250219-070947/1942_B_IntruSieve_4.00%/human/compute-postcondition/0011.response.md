Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing [0], `minn` is 1, `maxx` is 0, and the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`) is greater than 0. If `minn` equals `maxx`, `minn` remains 1.***
