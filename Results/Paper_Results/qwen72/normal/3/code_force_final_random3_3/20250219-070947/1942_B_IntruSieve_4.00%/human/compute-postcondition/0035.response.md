Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. If `arr[i] > 0` and `minn` is equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to 3 and `maxx` is set to 0, and `mex` is set to [0, 1]. If `arr[i] > 0` and `minn` is not equal to `maxx`, the values of `minn`, `maxx`, and `mex` remain unchanged. If `arr[i] <= 0`, then `mex` is updated to include `abs(arr[2] - minn)` as its third element, `minn` is either 3, 2, 1, or 0, and if `abs(arr[2] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[2] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` retains its original value.***
