Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either [0, 1] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), 0] or [0, abs(arr[1] - minn)] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), abs(arr[1] - minn)] with `abs(arr[2] - minn)` appended to its existing values, `minn` is either 3 or 2 or 1 or 0, and if `abs(arr[2] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[2] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` retains its original value.***
