The code snippet `mex.append(minn)` appends the value of `minn` to the list `mex`. The value of `minn` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `test_cases`, `arr`, `maxx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n), `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list containing either [0, 1] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), 0] or [0, abs(arr[1] - minn)] or [abs(arr[0] - minn), abs(arr[1] - minn)] with `minn` appended to it, `minn` is either 3 or 2 or 1 or 0, and `maxx` is either 0 or `abs(arr[0] - minn)` or `abs(arr[1] - minn)`.**
