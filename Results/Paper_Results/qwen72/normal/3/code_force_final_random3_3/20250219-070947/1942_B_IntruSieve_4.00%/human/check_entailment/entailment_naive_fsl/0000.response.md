Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` from the array `a`. Specifically, the logic for updating `mex` and handling the `minn` and `maxx` values is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

Actual Output from the provided program:
```
0 1 3 2 4
```

The program incorrectly constructs the permutation `p`. For the given input, the correct permutation `p` should be `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` to satisfy the conditions of the problem. However, the program outputs `[0, 1, 3, 2, 4]`, which does not satisfy the conditions for `a_3` and `a_5`.

To verify the correctness, let's break down the expected and actual outputs:

- For `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`:
  - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
  - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
  - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`
  - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`
  - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`

- For `p = [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]`:
  - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1`
  - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`
  - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 3) - 3 = -2` (This is correct, but let's continue)
  - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 3, 2) - 2 = 1` (This is correct, but let's continue)
  - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 3, 2, 4) - 4 = -1` (This is incorrect, should be 2)

The program fails to correctly handle the construction of the permutation for this input, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
