Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k - 2), a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k - 2), a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
