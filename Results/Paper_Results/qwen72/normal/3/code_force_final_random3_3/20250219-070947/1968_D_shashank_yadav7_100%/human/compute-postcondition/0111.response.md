Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0 + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer - 1, `s` is the input integer - 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is now `a[b] * k`, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true. If the if condition is false, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
