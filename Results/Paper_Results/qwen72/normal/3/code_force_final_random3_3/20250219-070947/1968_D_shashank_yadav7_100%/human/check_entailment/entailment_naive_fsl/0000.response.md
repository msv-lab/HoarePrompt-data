Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by subtracting 1 from the positions in the permutation array `p` and then using these modified positions to calculate the scores. This can lead to incorrect results because the positions in the permutation array `p` are 1-indexed, and subtracting 1 from them should only be done once at the beginning of the loop, not on every iteration.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```

Actual Output from the provided program:
```
Sasha
```

In this example, the correct scores after 2 turns should be:
- Bodya: 10
- Sasha: 9

However, the program incorrectly calculates the scores, leading to an incorrect result.
