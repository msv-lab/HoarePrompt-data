The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, as this is the condition that determines whether the loop will run. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself and starts at 0. Therefore, the state of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer - 1, `s` is the input integer - 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true. If the if condition is false, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
