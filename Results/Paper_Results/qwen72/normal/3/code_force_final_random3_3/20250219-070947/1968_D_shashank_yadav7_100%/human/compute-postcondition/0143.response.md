Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the input integer - 3, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + 3 * a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `4 * a[b]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code snippet `bp += a[b]` adds the value of `a[b]` to the existing value of `bp`. Since `bp` was initially `3 * a[b]`, after the addition, `bp` becomes `4 * a[b]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
