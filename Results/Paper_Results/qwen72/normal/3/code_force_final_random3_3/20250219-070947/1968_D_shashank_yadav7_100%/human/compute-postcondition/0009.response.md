Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `b` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is an input integer minus 1, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bm` is calculated as `a[b] * k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
