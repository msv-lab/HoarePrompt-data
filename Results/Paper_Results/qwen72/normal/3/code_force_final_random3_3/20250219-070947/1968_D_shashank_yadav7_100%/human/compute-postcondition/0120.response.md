Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`, and if `k` is 0, `k`, `b`, and `s` are set to 0, `sp` and `bp` are set to `a[0]`, `bm` and `sm` are set to `a[0] * 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the value of `a[b] * k + bp`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
