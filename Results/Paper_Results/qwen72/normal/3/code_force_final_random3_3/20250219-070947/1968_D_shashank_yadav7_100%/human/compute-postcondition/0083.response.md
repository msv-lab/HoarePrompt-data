The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the input integer - 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `a[b] * k + bp`, and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 1)`, `a[s] * k + sp`, and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
