Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]` (or `2 * a[b]`).** 

In natural language: The value of `bp` is updated to be twice the value of `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
