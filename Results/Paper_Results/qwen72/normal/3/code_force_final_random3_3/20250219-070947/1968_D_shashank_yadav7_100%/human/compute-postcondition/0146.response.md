Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0, or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `k` is 0 or the input integer - `n` if `k` never becomes 0.
- `b` is the value of `p[p[...[p[b] - 1]... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` applications of `p` and `n-1` subtractions of 1).
- `s` is the value of `p[p[...[p[s] - 1]... - 1] - 1]` (with `n` applications of `p` and `n-1` subtractions of 1).
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over `n` iterations.
- `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over `n` iterations.
- `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over `n` iterations.
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over `n` iterations.
- `bm` is greater than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet only contains a `print` statement with a string literal `'Bodya'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about various variables and their relationships, but none of this information affects the `print` statement in the code snippet.
- The `print` statement will simply output the string `'Bodya'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **Bodya**
