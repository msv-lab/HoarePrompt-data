Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the input integer - 3, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * (input integer - 2) + 2 * a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
