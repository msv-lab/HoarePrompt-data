Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to `a`, `b`, and `c` based on user input.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are now set to the input integers provided by the user.
- The variable `k` is not mentioned in the code snippet, so its state remains as described in the initial conditions.
