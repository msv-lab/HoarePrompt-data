You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9`) from the input, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The function then calculates and prints a value `k` for each test case. The value of `k` is determined as follows: if `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is set to `-1`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3`, and if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is incremented by 1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated `k` for each test case. After the function concludes, `n` is unchanged, and `i` is `n - 1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are reset for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of introverts `a`, extroverts `b`, and universals `c`.

2. **Introverts:**
   - Each introvert must have their own tent. Therefore, the number of tents required for introverts is `a`.

3. **Extroverts:**
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. This means we need to form groups of 3 for the extroverts.
   - The number of tents required for extroverts is `b // 3` (full groups of 3) plus any remaining extroverts that need to be paired with others.

4. **Universals:**
   - Universals can be used to fill in the remaining spots in the tents. If there are any remaining extroverts after forming full groups of 3, we can use universals to complete these groups.
   - The remaining extroverts after forming full groups of 3 are `b % 3`. We need to check if we have enough universals to form a group of 3 with these remaining extroverts.

5. **Check for Impossibility:**
   - If `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3`, it means we have some extroverts left over and not enough universals to form a group of 3 with them. This is a valid check for impossibility.
   - Additionally, if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it means the total number of extroverts and universals cannot be divided into groups of 3, which is another valid check for impossibility.

6. **Calculate Total Tents:**
   - The total number of tents required is the sum of tents for introverts and the number of groups of 3 formed by extroverts and universals.
   - If there are any remaining extroverts and universals that cannot form a complete group of 3, we need to add one more tent to accommodate them.

### Analysis of the Program:

- The program correctly handles the number of introverts by adding `a` to the total number of tents.
- It correctly calculates the number of full groups of 3 that can be formed by extroverts and universals using `(b + c) // 3`.
- It adds an extra tent if there are any remaining extroverts and universals that cannot form a complete group of 3.
- The checks for impossibility are correct:
  - If `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3`, it prints `-1`.
  - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it also prints `-1`.

### Example Test Cases:

- For `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`:
  - 1 tent for the introvert.
  - 2 extroverts and 1 universal can form 1 tent.
  - 2 universals can form 1 tent.
  - Total: 3 tents.

- For `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 1`:
  - 1 tent for the introvert.
  - 4 extroverts and 1 universal cannot form groups of 3 because we need 2 more universals to complete the last group.
  - Output: -1.

- For `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 2`:
  - 1 tent for the introvert.
  - 4 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 tents.
  - Total: 3 tents.

- For `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`:
  - 1 tent for the introvert.
  - 1 extrovert and 1 universal cannot form a group of 3.
  - Output: -1.

- For `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`:
  - 1 tent for the introvert.
  - 3 extroverts can form 1 tent.
  - 2 universals can form 1 tent.
  - Total: 3 tents.

- For `a = 19`, `b = 7`, `c = 18`:
  - 19 tents for the introverts.
  - 7 extroverts and 18 universals can form 8 tents.
  - Total: 27 tents.

- For `a = 0`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`:
  - No participants, so 0 tents.

- For `a = 7`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`:
  - 7 tents for the introverts.

- For `a = 0`, `b = 24`, `c = 0`:
  - 24 extroverts can form 8 tents.

- For `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`, `c = 1000000000`:
  - 1000000000 tents for the introverts.
  - 1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals can form 666666667 tents.
  - Total: 1666666667 tents.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
