You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three non-negative integers a, b, and c as input, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = 0
        
        if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)
        
    #State: `n` is equal to the initial value of `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. For each iteration, if `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3`, and if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is incremented by 1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the condition `if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is too restrictive and does not cover all scenarios where it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1
```
- There is 1 introvert, 1 extrovert, and 1 universal.
- The introvert will need 1 tent.
- The extrovert needs to be in a tent with 2 others, but there is only 1 universal left, which is not enough to form a group of 3.

The correct output should be `-1` because it is impossible to accommodate the extrovert with only 1 universal available. However, the program will output `1` in this case, which is incorrect.

Another example:
```
1
1 2 1
```
- There is 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 1 universal.
- The introvert will need 1 tent.
- The 2 extroverts need to be in a tent with 2 others, but there is only 1 universal available, which is not enough to form a group of 3 for both extroverts.

The correct output should be `-1` because it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts with only 1 universal available. However, the program will output `2` in this case, which is incorrect.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and can produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
