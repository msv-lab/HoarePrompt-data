The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` remains 0. Otherwise, if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. If `(b + c) % 3 == 0`, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3`.**
