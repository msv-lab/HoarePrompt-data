Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `b` is not divisible by 3, `c` is less than 3, and the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3`, and if the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3, `k` is incremented by 1.***
