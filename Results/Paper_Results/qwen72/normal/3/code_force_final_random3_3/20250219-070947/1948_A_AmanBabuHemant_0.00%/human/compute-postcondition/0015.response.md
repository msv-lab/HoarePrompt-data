Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` remains less than 200 if it was initially less than 200, or greater than or equal to 200 if it was initially greater than or equal to 200. `t` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer.
- If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`.
- If `n` is even, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` remains consistent with its initial condition (less than 200 or greater than or equal to 200).
- `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`.
- All other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
