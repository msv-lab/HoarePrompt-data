Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which remains less than 200 if it was initially less than 200, or greater than or equal to 200 if it was initially greater than or equal to 200. `t` is decremented by 1.***
