Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not generate a string of uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem description. Instead, it generates a string of '1's and '0's. For example, when `n = 6`, the output string is `110110110110`, which does not meet the requirement of the problem. The program should generate a string like `AAABAACC` where the special characters are uppercase Latin letters.
