Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO". Otherwise, it should return a string "YES" followed by a string of length at most 200 that satisfies the condition. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        s = '110' * (n // 2)
        if len(s) < 200:
            print('YES')
            print(s)
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` remains less than 200 if it was initially less than 200, or greater than or equal to 200 if it was initially greater than or equal to 200.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`. If `n` is even, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which remains less than 200 if it was initially less than 200, or greater than or equal to 200 if it was initially greater than or equal to 200. `t` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `t` or `n`, and `s` remains undefined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`. The length of `s` remains less than 200 if it was initially less than 200, or greater than or equal to 200 if it was initially greater than or equal to 200.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
