#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO". Otherwise, it should return a string "YES" followed by a string of length at most 200 that satisfies the condition.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to `n`, and `s` remains undefined. If `n` is even, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`. The length of `s` remains less than 200 if it was initially less than 200, or greater than or equal to 200 if it was initially greater than or equal to 200.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and checks if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO". If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` consisting of the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `t` and `n` are no longer in scope.
