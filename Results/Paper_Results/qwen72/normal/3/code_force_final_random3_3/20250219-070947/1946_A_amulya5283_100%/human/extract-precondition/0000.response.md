Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function should be designed to handle these inputs and return the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case.**
