To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. The loop will execute if `mdx` is less than `n`. Let's break down the state adjustments needed:

1. **`t` is an input integer minus 4 and `t` must be greater than -1**: This state is not directly related to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

2. **`n` is the new input integer**: This is a critical state for the loop. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than `mdx`.

3. **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user**: This state is not directly related to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

4. **`res` is 0**: This state is not directly related to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

5. **`mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**: This is a critical state for the loop. The loop will execute if `mdx` is less than `n`.

6. **If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`**: This means that if `n` is 1, `mdx` will be 0 (since `1 // 2 + 1 % 2 - 1 = 0`), and the loop will not execute because `mdx` is not less than `n`.

7. **If `n` is greater than 1, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`**: This means that for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start from `mdx`.

Given the above, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 and `mdx` is less than `n`. The initial state of `i` should be `mdx` for the loop to start correctly.

State: **`t` is an input integer minus 4 and `t` must be greater than -1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `res` is 0, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx`**
