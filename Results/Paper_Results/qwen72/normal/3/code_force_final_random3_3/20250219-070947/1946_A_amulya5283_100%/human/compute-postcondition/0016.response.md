Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`, `res` is 1 or 2 based on the previous condition.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is incremented by 1. If `res` was 0 before, it is now 1. If `res` was 1 before, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
