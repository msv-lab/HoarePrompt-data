Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`, `res` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2` is still valid. The initial value of `res` could have been 0, 1, or 2, but it is now increased by 1.
