The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. This operation updates the value of `a` and potentially changes the length of the list, which affects `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 3, `n` is the length of the new list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
