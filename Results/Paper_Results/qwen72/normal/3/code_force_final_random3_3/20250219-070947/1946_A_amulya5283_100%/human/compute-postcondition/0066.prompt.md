Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function should be designed to handle these inputs and return the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        res = 0
        mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
        for i in range(mdx, n):
            if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                res += 1
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `t`, `n`, or `a`. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an input integer minus 3, `n` is the length of the sorted list `a`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an input integer minus 4 and must be greater than -1, `n` is the new input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. Additionally, if `n` is greater than 1, `i` is set to `n` and `n` must be greater than `mdx`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
