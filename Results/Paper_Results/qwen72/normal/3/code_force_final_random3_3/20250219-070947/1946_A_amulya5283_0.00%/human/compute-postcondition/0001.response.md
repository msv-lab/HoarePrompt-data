The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and `results` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` should be 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
