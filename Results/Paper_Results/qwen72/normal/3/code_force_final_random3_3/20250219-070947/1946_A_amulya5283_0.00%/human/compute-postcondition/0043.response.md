Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are now greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the given range.
- The variable `i` remains 1.
- The list `results` now contains the final value of `operations`.
- The variable `n` remains the first element of `test_cases[1]`.
- The array `arr` remains sorted.
- The variable `median_index` is still `n // 2`.
- The variable `current_median` is still `arr[median_index]`.
- The heap `heap` now contains all elements from the original `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, but each element has been incremented by 1 as many times as necessary to ensure that the smallest element in the heap is greater than `current_median`.
- The variable `operations` is the total number of times the loop executed, which is the number of increments performed on the elements in the heap to make all elements greater than `current_median`.
