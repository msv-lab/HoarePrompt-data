Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[0]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[0]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`.**

The code snippet calculates the `median_index` by performing integer division of `n` by 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The `median_index` is now equal to `n // 2`.
