### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique to handle large inputs efficiently.
   - The program then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `arr` from the input data.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order using `arr.sort()`. This is necessary to find the median, which is defined as the middle element in the sorted array.

3. **Finding the Median:**
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct for both even and odd lengths of the array. For an odd length, this will be the exact middle element, and for an even length, this will be the first of the two middle elements.

4. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A min-heap is created from the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array. This is done using `heapq.heapify(heap)`. The heap is used to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.

5. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The program enters a loop where it increments the smallest element in the heap that is less than or equal to the current median. This is done by popping the smallest element, incrementing it, and pushing it back into the heap.
   - The loop continues until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. The number of operations required to achieve this is counted and stored in `operations`.

6. **Output:**
   - The results for each test case are collected in the `results` list and printed one by one.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Median Calculation:**
  - The median is correctly identified as the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array.
- **Efficiency of Incrementing Elements:**
  - Using a min-heap to increment the smallest elements is an efficient approach. It ensures that the smallest element that needs to be incremented is always at the root of the heap, making the operation O(log k) where k is the number of elements in the heap.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a loop and processing each test case independently.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The logic and implementation are sound, and the use of a heap ensures efficiency.

### Correctness:
**True**
