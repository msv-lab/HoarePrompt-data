Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]` (updated to the new median after sorting), `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are now greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

The code snippet `median_index = n // 2` recalculates the `median_index` based on the value of `n`. Since `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]` and has not changed, the value of `median_index` remains the same as it was previously calculated. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions, with no changes to the variables.
