Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has an even number of elements. According to the problem description, the median for an even-length array should be the element at the index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\), which is the element at index \(\frac{n}{2}\) (0-based index). However, the program incorrectly uses the element at index \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\) as the median for even-length arrays. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The correct median is 3 (index 2 in the sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4]), but the program will incorrectly use 2 (index 1) as the median. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
