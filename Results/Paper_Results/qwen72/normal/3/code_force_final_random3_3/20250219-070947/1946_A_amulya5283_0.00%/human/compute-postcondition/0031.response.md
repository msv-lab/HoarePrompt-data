To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to consider the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. The relevant states in the loop head are `heap[0]` and `current_median`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `i` is 1
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`
- `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`
- `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`
- `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end
- `operations` is 0

For the loop to execute, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `heap` is a min-heap, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap. The heap contains elements from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`. The `current_median` is the element at `arr[median_index]`.

To ensure the loop condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is met:
- `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given that `heap` is a min-heap and `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, and `current_median` is the element at `arr[median_index]`, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` will naturally be true if the heap is constructed correctly from the sorted array `arr`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[1]` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, `operations` is 0**
