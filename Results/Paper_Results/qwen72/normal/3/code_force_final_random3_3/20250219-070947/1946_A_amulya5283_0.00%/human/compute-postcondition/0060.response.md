Output State: **`heap[0]` is now the smallest element in the heap, `smallest` is equal to `arr[median_index] + 1`, `heap` has the same number of elements as before the execution of the code, and `operations` is increased by 2. The new smallest element in the heap is `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `operations` is incremented by 1, so it is now increased by 2 from its initial state.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
