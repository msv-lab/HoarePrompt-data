You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `T` of `n-1` integers. It constructs a new list `a` of `n` elements, where each element from index 1 to `n-1` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`. The function then prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0, `n` unchanged from its initial value for the last test case, and `a` containing `n` elements as described.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values for the number of test cases `t`, the number of elements `n` in each test case, and the list of integers `T` representing the array `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes the array `a` with a value of 1000. This is a valid choice because `1000` is within the range `[1, 10^9]` and can serve as a starting point for the construction of the array `a`.

3. **Array Construction**: The program constructs the array `a` by iterating through the elements of `T` and appending the value `a[i-1] + T[i-1]` to `a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`. This construction ensures that:
   - `a_i = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`
   - `a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a[i-1] + T[i-1]) \bmod a[i-1] = T[i-1] = x_i`

   This satisfies the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the constructed array `a` for each test case.

5. **Constraints**: The program ensures that all elements `a_i` are within the range `[1, 10^9]` because:
   - The initial value `1000` is within the range.
   - Each subsequent value `a[i-1] + T[i-1]` is also within the range because `T[i-1]` is at most `500` and `a[i-1]` is at least `1000`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases correctly:
   - For `n = 2`, it will correctly output an array of two elements.
   - For `n = 500`, it will handle the maximum number of elements as specified in the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and satisfies all the conditions of the problem.
