Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `a` is a list of `n-1` integers each between 1 and 500. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.** 

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1. The values of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged.
