Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `line` is a new string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is `n` - 1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` updates the list `T` to contain the integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer.
- The initial state of `T` is not specified, but after this code, `T` is a list of integers derived from `line`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `result` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
