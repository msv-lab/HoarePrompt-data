Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the integer 1000, `line` is a new string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is `n` - 1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = [1000]` resets the list `a` to contain only the integer 1000.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `line`, `T`, `i`, and `result` remain unchanged, but `a` is now specifically a list with a single element, 1000.
