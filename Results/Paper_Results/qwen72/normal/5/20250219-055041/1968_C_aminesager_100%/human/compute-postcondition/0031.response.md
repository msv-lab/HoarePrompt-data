The variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `line` is a new string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is `n` - 1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces**
