Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `line` is a new string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is `n` - 1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- `T` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `line`, `i`, and `result` remain unchanged from their initial states.
