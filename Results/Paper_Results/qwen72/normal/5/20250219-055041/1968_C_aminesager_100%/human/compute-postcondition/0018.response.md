Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer, `i` is `n` - 1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer.
- The other variables (`t`, `a`, `line`, `T`, `i`, `result`) remain unchanged, but `n` is now the new input integer.
- The list `a` still contains the same elements as described in the initial state, but `n` is now the new value.
- `i` is still `n` - 1, but `n` has been updated.
- `result` is still a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
