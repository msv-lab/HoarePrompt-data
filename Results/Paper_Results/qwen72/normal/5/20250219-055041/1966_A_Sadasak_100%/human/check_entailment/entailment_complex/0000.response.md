Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of cards left in your hand after performing the allowed operations. The core of the solution is to count the frequency of each card number and then determine the minimum number of cards based on these frequencies and the value of `k`.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange value `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums` and caps the frequency at `k`. This is done to ensure that if a card number appears more than `k` times, it is treated as appearing exactly `k` times, which is the maximum number of cards that can be exchanged in one operation.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - If `k > n`, it means there are not enough cards to perform any exchange, so the program correctly outputs `n` as the minimum number of cards left.
   - If `k` is in the values of the frequency table, it means there is at least one card number that appears exactly `k` times. In this case, you can perform an exchange operation to reduce the number of cards by 1 (since `k` cards are exchanged for `k-1` cards), and the program correctly outputs `k - 1`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program outputs `n`, which is incorrect. The program should instead calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing all possible exchanges.

4. **Correct Output Calculation**:
   - The correct approach is to calculate the total number of cards that can be reduced by performing the exchange operations. This can be done by summing up the number of groups of `k` cards that can be formed for each card number and then reducing the total number of cards by the number of such groups, each reducing the count by 1.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing all possible exchanges.

Correctness: **False**
