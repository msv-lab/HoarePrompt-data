Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and each value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The integer `k` remains unchanged.
- The dictionary `frequency_table` contains each unique integer from `arr` as a key.
- The value associated with each key in `frequency_table` is the number of times that integer appears in `arr`, but if this count exceeds `k`, the value is set to `k`. Therefore, the maximum value in `frequency_table` for any key is `k`.
