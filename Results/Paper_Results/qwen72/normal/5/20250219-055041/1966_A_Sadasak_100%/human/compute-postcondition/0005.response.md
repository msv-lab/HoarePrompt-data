Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `num` is the first integer in `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` > `k`, then the value of `num` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `num` in `frequency_table` remains 1.***
