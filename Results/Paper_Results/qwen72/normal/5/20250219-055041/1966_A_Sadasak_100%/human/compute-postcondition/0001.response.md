The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. The variable `num` will take the value of the first element in `arr` at the start of the loop.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `num` is the first integer in `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
