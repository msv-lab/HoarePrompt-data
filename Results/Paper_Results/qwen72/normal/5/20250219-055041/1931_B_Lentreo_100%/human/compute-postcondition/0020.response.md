Output State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), `curr` is the sum of `(nums[i] - mean)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `curr` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function completes the loop with `curr` equal to 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `nums` remains unchanged, the length `n` of `nums` is still the same, the sum `total` of the elements in `nums` is still divisible by `n`, and the `mean` is still the integer division of `total` by `n`. The variable `curr` will be the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the `mean` for all elements in the list. Since the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly divisible by `n`, the final value of `curr` will be 0. If at any point during the loop `curr` becomes less than 0, the function will return 'NO' and terminate early. If the loop completes without `curr` becoming less than 0, the function will have `curr` equal to 0 at the end.
