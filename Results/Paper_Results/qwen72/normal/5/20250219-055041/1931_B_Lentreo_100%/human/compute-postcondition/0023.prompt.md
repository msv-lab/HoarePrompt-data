You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in nums is divisible by the length of nums.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly divisible by `n` (i.e., `total % n == 0`).
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), `curr` is the sum of `(nums[i] - mean)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `curr` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function completes the loop with `curr` equal to 0.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `nums` where the sum of the elements is divisible by the length of the list. It returns 'NO' in most cases, and 'YES' in a specific, unmentioned case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'.

Case_3: The program returns 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns 'NO'

Case_5: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
