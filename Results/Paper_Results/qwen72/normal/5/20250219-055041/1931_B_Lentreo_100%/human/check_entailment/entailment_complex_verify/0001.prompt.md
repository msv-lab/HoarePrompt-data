You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in nums is divisible by the length of nums.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly divisible by `n` (i.e., `total % n == 0`).
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), `curr` is the sum of `(nums[i] - mean)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `curr` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function completes the loop with `curr` equal to 0.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of non-negative integers `nums` where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of the list. It returns 'NO' if the sum of the deviations of the elements from the mean (calculated as the integer division of the total sum by the length of the list) is negative at any point during the iteration through the list. If the sum of the deviations remains non-negative throughout the iteration, the function returns 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given `n` containers with different amounts of water.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container after equalization is `mean = total // n`.
   - To achieve equalization, we need to ensure that we can always pour water from a container with more than the mean to a container with less than the mean, and this must be possible without violating the `i < j` condition.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean of the water amounts.
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr` between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that we cannot pour enough water from the previous containers to the current container to reach the mean, and thus it is impossible to equalize the water amounts.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n = 1`, the problem is trivially true because there is only one container.
   - If all containers already have the same amount of water, the problem is also trivially true.
   - The program correctly handles these cases.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the mean.
   - The program correctly checks if the cumulative difference `curr` becomes negative at any point.
   - If `curr` becomes negative, it correctly returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it correctly returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning above.

Correctness: **True**
