### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the operation of pouring water from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, ensuring that an equal distribution is theoretically possible.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers `nums` representing the initial amounts of water in the containers.
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if the total is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant.
   - The mean amount of water per container is calculated as `mean = total // n`.
   - The function then iterates through the list, maintaining a running sum `curr` of the deviations from the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The key insight is that if the sum of the deviations from the mean becomes negative at any point, it means that the water cannot be evenly distributed using the given operation.
   - This is because the operation only allows pouring water from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index. If `curr` becomes negative, it implies that more water has been poured out than can be poured in, which is not possible under the given constraints.
   - If `curr` remains non-negative throughout the loop, it means that the water can be evenly distributed, and the function correctly returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the sum of the elements is divisible by `n` (guaranteed by the problem).
   - It correctly handles the case where the list has only one element (trivially 'YES').
   - It correctly handles the case where the list has multiple elements and the sum can be evenly distributed.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers using the given operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
