Output State: **The program returns 'YES'**. This indicates that the function has completed its loop without encountering a situation where `curr` is less than 0, and `curr` is equal to 0 at the end of the loop. The sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, and the mean value calculated from this sum and length has been used to ensure that the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean is 0, which is consistent with the properties of the mean.
