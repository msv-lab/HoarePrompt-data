To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop counter, and it starts at 0 by default when using `range(n)`.
2. **Variable `n`**: This is the length of the `nums` list, and it determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`.
- `n` is the length of `nums`.
- `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`.
- `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`).
- The sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly divisible by `n` (i.e., `total % n == 0`).
- `curr` is 0.

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is automatically set to 0 by the `range(n)` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly divisible by `n` (i.e., `total % n == 0`), `curr` is 0, `i` is 0**
