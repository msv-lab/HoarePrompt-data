Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is in the range 1 to 2 * 10^5; `counter` is 0, 1, or 2, `i` is `len(num) - 3`. If the third-to-last element of `num` is 0, `counter` is 2. If the third-to-last element of `num` is not 0, `counter` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is in. Therefore, the values of `num`, `counter`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.
