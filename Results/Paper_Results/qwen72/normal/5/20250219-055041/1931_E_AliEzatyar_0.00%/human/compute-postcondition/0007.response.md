The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `num`. The loop iterates backward from `len(num) - 1` to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(num) - 2`.

The state of `num` does not change in the loop head, so it remains the same. The variable `counter` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is in the range 1 to 2 * 10^5; `counter` is 0 or 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2`. If the second-to-last element of `num` is 0, `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
