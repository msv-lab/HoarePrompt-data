Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an array `values` of size `inf` (which is set to 200,001) to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for numbers from 0 to 200,000. This is a good approach because it allows for quick lookups later.

2. **Precomputation**: The program precomputes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sum in the `values` array. This is done using a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over each number `i` and the inner loop iterates over the digits of `i`.

3. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the value `n` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum from the `values` array.

4. **Efficiency**: The precomputation step runs in O(n * d) time, where `n` is the number of integers (200,000) and `d` is the number of digits in the largest number (which is 6 for 200,000). This is efficient enough to handle the constraints within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

5. **Correct Output**: The program correctly outputs the sum of the digit sums for the given `n` in each test case.

Given these points, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the provided problem description.
