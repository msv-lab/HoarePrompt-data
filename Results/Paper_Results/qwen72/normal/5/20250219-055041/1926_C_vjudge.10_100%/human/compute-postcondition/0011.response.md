Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is `t`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `t` inclusive, `x` is the last digit of `t`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each digit of the integer `i` (which starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration).
- For each digit `x` in the string representation of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is incremented by the integer value of `x`.
- After `t` iterations, `i` will be equal to `t`.
- `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `t` inclusive.
- `x` will be the last digit of `t` because the loop will have just processed the last digit of `t` in the final iteration.
