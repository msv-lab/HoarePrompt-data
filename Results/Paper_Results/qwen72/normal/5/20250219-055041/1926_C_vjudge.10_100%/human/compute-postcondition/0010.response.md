The value of `sum_value_digits` is incremented by the integer value of `x`. The value of `x` is '2', so `int(x)` is 2. Therefore, `sum_value_digits` becomes 3 + 2, which is 5. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 2, `sum_value_digits` is 5, `x` is '2'**
