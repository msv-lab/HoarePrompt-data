The loop head consists of the variable `x` and the string representation of `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case.
- `inf` is 200001.
- `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[t + 1]` now equal to `values[t] + the sum of the digits of t + 1`.
- `i` is `t + 2`.
- `sum_value_digits` is the first digit of `i`.
- `values[i]` is now equal to `values[i - 1] + the sum of the digits of t + 1`.

The loop statement is:
```
for x in str(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To execute the loop one more time, the string representation of `i` must have more characters to iterate over. The variable `x` will take the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Since the loop is iterating over the characters of `str(i)`, and at the end of the previous iteration `i` is `t + 2`, the next character in the string representation of `i` will be the next digit of `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[t + 1]` now equal to `values[t] + the sum of the digits of t + 1`, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is the first digit of `i`, `values[i]` is now equal to `values[i - 1] + the sum of the digits of t + 1`, `x` is the second digit of `i`**
