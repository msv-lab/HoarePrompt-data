Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is now equal to `values[i - 1] + the sum of the digits of `n` for all `i` from `t + 1` to `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `n`, `x` is the last digit of `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `values[i]` to be `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.
- Since `i` is `n + 1`, the specific index being updated is `values[n + 1]`.
- `values[n + 1]` is now equal to `values[n] + sum_value_digits`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `inf`, `sum_value_digits`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1] + the sum of the digits of `i` for all `i` from `t + 1` to `n` is extended to include `i = n + 1`.
