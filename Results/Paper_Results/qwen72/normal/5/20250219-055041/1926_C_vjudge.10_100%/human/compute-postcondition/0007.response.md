The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is '1'. The string representation of `i` is "1", which has only one character. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and the loop will then iterate over the string "2", which also has one character. Therefore, `x` will be '2' at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 2, `sum_value_digits` is 1, `x` is '2'**
