Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. If `start` < `end`, `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `s1` is updated to the absolute value of the difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.
- The conditions for `s2` remain as specified in the initial state, but `s2` itself is not updated by the given code snippet.
- The values of `i`, `m`, `s`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged.
