Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is 1 if `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; otherwise, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d2[start]` is `s`**

Explanation:
- The variable `mini` is set to 11111111, overriding its previous value.
- The value of `s` is calculated based on the new value of `mini` and the current values of `start` and `inc`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, `inc`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
