Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.** 

The value of `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and its previous value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
