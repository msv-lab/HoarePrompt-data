Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and `start` is `0`. The variable `s` has accumulated the sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the initial `start` to `end - 1`, and `d2` now contains the accumulated values of `s` at each index from `len(lst) - 1` to `0`. The variables `t`, `i`, `d1`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `start` has reached the value `0`.
- The variable `s` has been updated to the sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the initial `start` (which was `len(lst) - 1`) to `end - 1` (which is `-1`).
- The dictionary `d2` now contains the values of `s` at each index from `len(lst) - 1` to `0`, reflecting the accumulated sum of the minimum absolute differences at each step of the loop.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `d1`, `n`, and `lst`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
