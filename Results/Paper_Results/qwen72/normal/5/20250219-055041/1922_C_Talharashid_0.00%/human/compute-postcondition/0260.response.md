Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` must be greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1.** 

The code snippet `inc = 1` initializes the variable `inc` to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
