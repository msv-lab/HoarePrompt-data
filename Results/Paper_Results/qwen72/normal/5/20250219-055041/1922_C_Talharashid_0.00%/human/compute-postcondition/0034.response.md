Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start + inc`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1` and `end` must be greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111 if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[start + inc])`. If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is further incremented by 1, and `d1[start]` is set to `s + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is further incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, and `d1[start]` is set to `s + abs(lst[0] - lst[start + inc])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `start` is incremented by `inc`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, `mini`, and `s` remain unchanged, but the conditions for `mini` and `s` are still valid based on the new value of `start`.
- The specific updates to `mini` and `s` depend on the new value of `start` and the elements in `lst`, but the logic for these updates remains the same as described in the initial state.
