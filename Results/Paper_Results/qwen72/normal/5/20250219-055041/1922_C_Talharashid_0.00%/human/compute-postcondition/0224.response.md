Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.**

The code snippet `s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` calculates the absolute value of the difference between the elements at the indices `start` and `end` in the list `d2`, and assigns this value to the variable `s2`. The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, and `s1` remain unchanged.
