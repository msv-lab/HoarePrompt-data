Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and `start` is `0`. The variable `s` has accumulated the sum of the minimum absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list `lst` from the initial `start` to `end - 1`, and `d2` now contains the accumulated values of `s` at each index from `len(lst) - 1` to `0`. The variables `t`, `i`, `d1`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged. `m` is an input integer.**
