Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` are input integers. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `start` is decremented by 1.
- The values of `i`, `m`, `s`, and `end` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `s1` and `s2` are still valid, but the value of `start` has been updated to `start - 1`.
