Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.***
