Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is the first integer from the last user input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the last user input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` is an input integer. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` ≥ `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be an input integer.
- The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, `m`, `s1`, and `s2`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `s1` and `s2` based on the values of `start` and `end` are still valid as they were in the initial state.
