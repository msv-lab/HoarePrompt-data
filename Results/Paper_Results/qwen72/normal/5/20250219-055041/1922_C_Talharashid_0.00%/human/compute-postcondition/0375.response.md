Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `s` is 0, `start` is an input integer minus 1, `end` is an input integer minus 1, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**

The code snippet `s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` calculates the absolute difference between the values at the indices `start` and `end` in the list `d1`, and assigns this value to `s2`. The values of `i`, `m`, `s`, `start`, `end`, and `s1` remain unchanged.
