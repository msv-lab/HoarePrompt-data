The code snippet `s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` updates the value of `s` by adding the absolute difference between the elements at indices `start` and `start + inc` in the list `lst`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `m`
- `m` is greater than or equal to 3
- `start` is 2
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is `s`
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0
- `t` is greater than `m`
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `inc` is 1
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[2] - lst[1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains the minimum of `abs(lst[2] - lst[3])` and 11111111, provided `start + 1 < len(lst)`. If `start + 1 >= len(lst)`, `mini` remains 11111111.

Let's calculate the new value of `s`:
- `start` is 2
- `inc` is 1
- `s` is updated by adding `abs(lst[2] - lst[3])`

Therefore, the new value of `s` is `s + abs(lst[2] - lst[3])`.

Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is 2, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is `s + abs(lst[2] - lst[3])`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1, and if `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[2] - lst[1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the minimum of `abs(lst[2] - lst[3])` and 11111111, provided `start + 1 < len(lst)`. If `start + 1 >= len(lst)`, `mini` remains 11111111.**
