Output State: **`t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d1` at indices `end` and `start`.
- `d1` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, so if `end` or `start` are not keys in `d1`, they will default to 0.
- The value of `s1` is now the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
