The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m - 1` and `m` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than `m - 1`.

State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is 0, `start` is an input integer - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1. If `start` < `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is the absolute value of the difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute value of the difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. `t` must be greater than `m`**
