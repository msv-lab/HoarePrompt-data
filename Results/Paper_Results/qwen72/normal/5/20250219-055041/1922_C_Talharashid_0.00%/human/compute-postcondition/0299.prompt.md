Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is 0, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` must be greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[1]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1, and if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and 11111000. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111000. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is set to `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is 2, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `d1[2]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1, `mini` is updated to `min(abs(lst[1] - lst[0]), mini)` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `d1[1]` is `s + 1`. Otherwise, `d1[1]` is `s + abs(lst[1] - lst[2])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `start` is 3, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `d1[2]` is either `s + 1` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or `s + abs(lst[2] - lst[3])` otherwise, `d1[3]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `t` is greater than `m`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers provided by the user, `inc` is 1, and if `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[3] - lst[2])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the minimum of `abs(lst[3] - lst[4])` and 11111111, provided `start + 1 < len(lst)`. If `start + 1 >= len(lst)`, `mini` remains 11111111.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
