Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is an input integer. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end - 1] - d2[start - 1])`, and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

Explanation: The value of `start` is decremented by 1. The values of `i`, `m`, `s`, and `end` remain unchanged. The conditions for calculating `s1` and `s2` are still valid, but the value of `start` is now one less than its initial value.
