The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. However, `i` needs to be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
