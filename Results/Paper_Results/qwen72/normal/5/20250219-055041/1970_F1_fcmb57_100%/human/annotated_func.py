#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, such that 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both a and b are odd.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program results in an error because `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, `dx` and `dy` are not defined, and the return statement `return x + dx, y + dy` cannot be executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are odd integers between 3 and 99. However, due to an error in the code, it attempts to unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`. Since `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked, the function results in a runtime error and does not return any values.
