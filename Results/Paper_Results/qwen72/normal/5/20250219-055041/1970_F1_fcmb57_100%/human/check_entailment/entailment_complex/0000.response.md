Reasoning:

The program provided has a few issues that need to be addressed to determine its correctness:

1. **Function Definition and Usage**: The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters `a` and `b`. In the context of the program, `a` is a tuple representing the current position of a player (x, y), and `b` is a tuple representing the movement direction (dx, dy). However, the function is called with `mouvements[mo[1]]` as the second argument, which is a tuple, but the function itself incorrectly treats `b` as an integer, leading to a runtime error when trying to unpack `b` into `dx` and `dy`.

2. **Goal Scoring Logic**: The logic for scoring goals is incorrect. The program checks if the player's position is in the list of goals for the red or blue team, but it should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle and then determine if the goal is of the opposing team. If the player scores in their own goal, the opposing team should get the point.

3. **Handling the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the Quaffle's movement to the center of the field after a goal is scored. The Quaffle should be placed back at the center of the field (the cell at the (M+1)/2-th column of the (N+1)/2-th line) after each goal.

4. **Player Carrying the Quaffle**: The program does not keep track of which player is carrying the Quaffle. This is crucial for determining if a player can score a goal or if they are just moving the Quaffle.

5. **Output Format**: The output format for the final score is correct, but the program does not handle the Quaffle's state or the player's state (whether they are carrying the Quaffle) correctly, which could lead to incorrect scoring events.

Given these issues, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
