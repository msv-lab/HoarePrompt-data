Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the rules of the game as described:

1. **Incorrect Movement Function**:
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to handle the movement of players, but it is not defined to handle the movement of the Quaffle. The Quaffle should move to the middle of the field when a goal is scored, but this is not handled in the function or the main loop.

2. **Handling of Ball Catching and Throwing**:
   - The program does not handle the catching and throwing of the Quaffle. There is no logic to track which player is carrying the Quaffle, and there is no mechanism to catch the Quaffle or throw it.

3. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**:
   - The goal scoring logic is incorrect. The program checks if the player's position is in the list of goals, but it does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle. A player should only score a goal if they are carrying the Quaffle and place it in the opponent's goal.

4. **Handling of Own Goals**:
   - The program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in their own goal, the other team should get the point.

5. **Quaffle Position Tracking**:
   - The program does not track the position of the Quaffle. The Quaffle should be moved to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, and it should be catchable by players.

### Corrected Program:
To correct the program, you would need to:
- Track the Quaffle's position.
- Handle the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.
- Correctly score goals based on the Quaffle's position and the player's team.
- Move the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
quaffle_pos = None

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quaffle_pos = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

def move_entity(pos, direction):
    (x, y) = pos
    (dx, dy) = mouvements[direction]
    return (x + dx, y + dy)

def is_goal(pos, team):
    return pos in goals[team]

def reset_quaffle():
    return ((m + 1) // 2 - 1, (n + 1) // 2 - 1)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    entity = mo[0]
    action = mo[1]
    
    if action in 'ULDR':
        players[entity] = move_entity(players[entity], action)
    elif action == 'C':
        if players[entity] == quaffle_pos:
            quaffle_pos = None  # Player is now carrying the Quaffle
    elif action == 'T':
        if quaffle_pos is None:  # Player is carrying the Quaffle
            if is_goal(players[entity], 'B'):
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            elif is_goal(players[entity], 'R'):
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quaffle_pos = reset_quaffle()

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected program should now correctly handle the game rules and produce the expected output.
