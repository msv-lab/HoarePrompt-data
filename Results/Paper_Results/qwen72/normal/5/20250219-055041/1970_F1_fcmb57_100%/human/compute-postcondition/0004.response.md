Functionality: ** The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are odd integers between 3 and 99. However, due to an error in the code, it attempts to unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`. Since `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked, the function results in a runtime error and does not return any values. **
