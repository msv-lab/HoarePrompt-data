Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `x` is `n`, `y` is 1.**

The code snippet `y = i * i` assigns the value of `i * i` to `y`. Since `i` is 1, `y` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the new value of `y`.
