You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It returns 1 if the sum of a series of calculations based on `n` and `m-1` is zero. Otherwise, it returns the sum of these calculations, which is the sum of `n + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`. The final state of the program includes the unchanged values of `n` and `m`, and the computed value of `cnt` which is returned.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The function works correctly by repeatedly applying the operation `(a, b) = (b, a % b)` until `b` becomes zero. The GCD is then the value of `a`.
   - This function is correct and will return the GCD of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**
   - This function is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1` and calculates `x` and `y` as follows:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
   - It then adds `x // y + (i > 1)` to the count `cnt`.
   - Finally, it returns `1` if `cnt` is zero, otherwise it returns `cnt`.

3. **Analysis of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. The conditions for counting valid pairs `(a, b)` are not correctly implemented.
   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not directly relate to the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     - `a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`.
     - This implies that `a` must be of the form `b * (k * gcd(a, b) - 1)`.
   - The current implementation does not correctly check this condition for all possible pairs `(a, b)`.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - A correct implementation would involve nested loops and the use of the GCD function to check the condition for each pair.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the problem's conditions.

Correctness: **False**
