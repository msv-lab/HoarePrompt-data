The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. 

Case_1: If a specific condition is met, the function returns 1.

Case_2: If the value of `cnt` is not equal to 0, the function returns the sum of `n + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, where `i` is `m-1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `m`, and returns 1 if a specific condition is met. If the value of `cnt` is not equal to 0, it returns the sum of a series of calculations based on `n` and `m-1`.**
