Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `n`, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 4**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated to `i * i`, which is `2 * 2` (since `i` is 2). Therefore, `y` is now 4. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `cnt`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
