Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is `m-1`, `cnt` is the sum of `n + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain as positive integers within the range 1 to 2,000,000.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `m-1`, which is the last value it takes before the loop terminates.
- **`cnt`**: The final value of `cnt` is the sum of the expression `n + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` evaluated for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`. This means:
  - For `i = 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `n`.
  - For `i = 2`, `cnt` is incremented by `(n - 2) // 4 + 1`.
  - For `i = 3`, `cnt` is incremented by `(n - 6) // 9 + 1`.
  - This pattern continues until `i = m-1`.

So, the final value of `cnt` is the sum of these increments for all `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
