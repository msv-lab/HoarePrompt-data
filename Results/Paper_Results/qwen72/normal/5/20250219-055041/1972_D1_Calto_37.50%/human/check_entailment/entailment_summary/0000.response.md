Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
- This function is correct and will return the GCD of `a` and `b`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
- However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the required condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Issues with `func_2`:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1`, but `i` should represent `b` in the problem statement, and the range should be from 1 to `m` (inclusive).
- The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The condition `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` is not logically related to the problem's requirement.
- The special case `if cnt == 0: return 1` is not justified by the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
- For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- This can be done by iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition for each pair.

### Conclusion:
The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
