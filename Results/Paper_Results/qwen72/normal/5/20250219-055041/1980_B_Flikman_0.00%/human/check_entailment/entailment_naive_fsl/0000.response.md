Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the favorite cube's value is the same as other cubes, and the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube's value is less than `k`, but the sum of cubes with the same value and greater values is greater than or equal to `k`. In such a case, the favorite cube may or may not be removed, but the program incorrectly prints "NO" in this scenario.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
5 2 3
4 3 3 3 3
```
Expected output:
```
MAYBE
```
Actual output:
```
NO
```
In this example, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3, and there are 4 cubes with the same value. The number of cubes with values greater than 3 is 1. Since `k = 3`, the favorite cube may or may not be removed, but the program incorrectly prints "NO".
