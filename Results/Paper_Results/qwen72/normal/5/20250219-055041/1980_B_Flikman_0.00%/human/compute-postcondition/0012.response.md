Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `value` is the second element in the list `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is 2. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 0.***
