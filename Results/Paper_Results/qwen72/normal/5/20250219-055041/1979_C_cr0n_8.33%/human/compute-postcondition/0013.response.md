Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `cases` is a list of test cases.
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `vals` is a list of integers.
   - `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.
   - `r` is the last element of `vals`.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` except the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - `den` is equal to `prod` - the sum of all elements in `vprod`.
   - The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer `-1`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their relationships, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement in this case.
   - The condition that `den` is less than or equal to 0 is given, but it does not influence the `print` statement directly.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output is straightforward:

Output: **-1**
