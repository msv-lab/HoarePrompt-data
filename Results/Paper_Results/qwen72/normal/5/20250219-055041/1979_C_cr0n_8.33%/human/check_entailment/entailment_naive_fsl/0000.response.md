Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the input values for `k_i` are all the same, which can lead to a situation where the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is not strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
2
3 3
```

The program will output:
```
1 1
```

However, this is incorrect because:
- The total amount of coins bet is \(1 + 1 = 2\).
- If the first outcome is winning, you receive back \(3 \times 1 = 3\) coins.
- If the second outcome is winning, you receive back \(3 \times 1 = 3\) coins.

In both cases, the amount received back is not strictly greater than the total amount bet. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
