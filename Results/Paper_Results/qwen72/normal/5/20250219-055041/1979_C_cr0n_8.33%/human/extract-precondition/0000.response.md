It seems there is a mismatch between the problem description and the provided function definition. The function should take parameters based on the problem description. Let's correct the function definition and then extract the precondition.

Corrected function definition:
```
def func_1(t, cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each element in cases is a list containing two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome is winning.**
