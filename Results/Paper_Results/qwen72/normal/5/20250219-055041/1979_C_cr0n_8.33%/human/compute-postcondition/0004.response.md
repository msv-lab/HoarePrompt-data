Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `prod` is now equal to the first element of `vals`, `r` is the first element of `vals`.** 

The value of `prod` is updated to be the same as the value of `r`, which is the first element of the list `vals`. All other variables remain unchanged.
