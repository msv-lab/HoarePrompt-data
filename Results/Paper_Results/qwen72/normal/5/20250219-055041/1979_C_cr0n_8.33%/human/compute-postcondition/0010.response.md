Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers, `prod` is now equal to the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` except the corresponding element in `vals`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `vprod` where each element is calculated as `(prod // r)` for each `r` in `vals`.
- `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.
- For each `r` in `vals`, `(prod // r)` effectively calculates the product of all elements in `vals` except `r`.
- Therefore, `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` except the corresponding element in `vals`.
- The values of `t`, `cases`, `N`, `vals`, `prod`, and `r` remain unchanged.
