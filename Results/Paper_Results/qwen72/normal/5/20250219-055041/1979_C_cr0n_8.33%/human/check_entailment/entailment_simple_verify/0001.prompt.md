You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    -1

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is the sum of all `x_i` values, and it must be less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_N`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then calculates `vprod` as the list of `prod // k_i` for each `k_i`.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating no solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `vprod` list as the distribution of coins.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - The key idea is to ensure that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program uses the product of all multipliers `prod` and divides it by each multiplier to get `vprod`.
   - The sum of `vprod` should be strictly less than `prod` for the solution to be valid.
   - If `prod - sum(vprod) <= 0`, it means the total amount bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and thus, there is no valid solution.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic of using `prod` and `vprod` is based on the fact that `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, ensuring that the distribution is valid.
   - The condition `prod - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid solution exists by printing `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the multipliers are all the same (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`), which should result in `-1` because it's impossible to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any outcome.
   - The program also handles the case where the multipliers are different and a valid distribution exists.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the distribution of coins for each test case and handles the edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
