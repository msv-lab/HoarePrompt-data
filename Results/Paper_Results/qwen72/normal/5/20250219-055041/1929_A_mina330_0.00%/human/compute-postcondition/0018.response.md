Output State: **`ntest` must be greater than 1, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `kq` is 0, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.**

The value of `kq` is reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. `ntest` is still greater than 1, `itest` is still 1, `n` is still an input integer, `a` is still a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is still `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
