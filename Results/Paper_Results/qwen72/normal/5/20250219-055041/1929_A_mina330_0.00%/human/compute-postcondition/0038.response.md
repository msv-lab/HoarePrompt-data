Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`, `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the list `a` for the first half of the list.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `a` remains unchanged and is still the sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `i` ends up being `len(a) // 2 - 1`, which is the last index that the loop iterates over.
- The variable `kq` is the sum of the differences between the last element and the first element, the second-to-last element and the second element, and so on, up to the first half of the list. For example, if `a` has 6 elements, `kq` will be the sum of `(a[5] - a[0])`, `(a[4] - a[1])`, and `(a[3] - a[2])`.
