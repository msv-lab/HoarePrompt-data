The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a` at index 0 plus the first character of the string in `a` at index 1, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a` at index 0 plus the last character of the string in `a` at index 1, `i` is 2**
