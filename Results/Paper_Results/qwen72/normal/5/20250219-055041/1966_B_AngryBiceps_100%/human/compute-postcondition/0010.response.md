Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the input string in `a` at index 0, `last_row` is the last character of the input string in `a` at index 0, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` adds a new input string to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains one input string, so after appending, `a` now contains two input strings. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` remain unchanged.
