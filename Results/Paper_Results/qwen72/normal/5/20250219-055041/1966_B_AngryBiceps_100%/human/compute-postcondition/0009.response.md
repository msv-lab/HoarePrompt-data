The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`, so `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the input string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the input string in `a`, `i` is 1**
