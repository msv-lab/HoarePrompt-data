The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases, `t`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since the state before the loop starts already specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, we can assume that the input will be a valid integer within this range. However, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
