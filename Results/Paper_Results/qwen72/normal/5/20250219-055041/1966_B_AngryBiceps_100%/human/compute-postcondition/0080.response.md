Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` contains only one distinct character, the last string in `a` contains only one distinct character, and the first string is not equal to the last string, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part, where either the first string in the list `a` contains more than one distinct character, or the last string in the list `a` contains more than one distinct character, or the first string in the list `a` is the same as the last string in the list `a`.***
