Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. Additionally, the length of the set of `first_row` is 1, the length of the set of `last_row` is 1, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.**
