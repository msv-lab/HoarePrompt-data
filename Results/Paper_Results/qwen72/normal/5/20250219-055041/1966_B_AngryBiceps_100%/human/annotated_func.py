#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a grid of characters 'W' and 'B' representing white and black squares, respectively. The grid is defined by its dimensions n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The total number of test cases, t, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The total number of test cases `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers for each test case, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings for each test case, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a` concatenated together for each test case, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a` concatenated together for each test case, and `i` is `n-1` for each test case. For each test case, if the first string in `a` and the last string in `a` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, or if `first_row` and `last_row` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, then the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the program prints 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a grid of characters 'W' and 'B' with dimensions `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500). For each test case, it reads the grid and checks two conditions: 
1. If the first row and the last row of the grid each consist of a single repeated character and these characters are different.
2. If the first column and the last column of the grid each consist of a single repeated character and these characters are different.
If either condition is true, the function prints 'NO' for that test case. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value. The total number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
