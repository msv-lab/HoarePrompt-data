Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the input string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the input string in `a` at index 1, `last_row` is the last character of the input string in `a` at index 0, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- `first_row` is updated by concatenating the first character of the input string in `a` at index 0 with the first character of the input string in `a` at index 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `last_row`, `i`) remain unchanged.
