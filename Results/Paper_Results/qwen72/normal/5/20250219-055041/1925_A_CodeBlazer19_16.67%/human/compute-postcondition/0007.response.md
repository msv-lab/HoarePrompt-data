Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the string 'ab', `j` is 98**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` (which is 98) to the string `s`. The ASCII value 98 corresponds to the character 'b', so `s` becomes 'ab'. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.
