Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet, `j` is `k` + 96, `k` must be at least 1.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `s` will contain the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet, starting from 'a'. The variable `j` will be equal to `k` + 96, which is the last ASCII value used to generate the string `s`. The values of `n`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
