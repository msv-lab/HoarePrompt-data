The values of `n` and `k` are reassigned based on the input provided by the user. The input is split and each part is converted to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t` and `i` are not affected by this code. The conditions for `s` and `j` based on the value of `k` remain the same, but the specific values of `n` and `k` are now determined by the user input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `k` is 1, `s` is the string 'a' and `j` is 97. Otherwise, `s` is the string containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a' and `j` is `k` + 96, with `k` not equal to 1.**
