Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is a string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet, `j` is `k` + 96, `k` must be greater than 1.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variables `n` and `k` remain as positive integers within the specified range (1 to 26).
- The variable `t` remains greater than 1.
- The variable `i` remains 2.
- The variable `s` is now a string that contains the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet, starting from 'a'.
- The variable `j` has reached the value `k` + 96, which is the end of the range specified in the loop.
- The variable `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at all.
