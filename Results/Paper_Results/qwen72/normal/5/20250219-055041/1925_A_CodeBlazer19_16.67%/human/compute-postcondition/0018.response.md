Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an empty string, `j` is `k` + 96 if `k` is not 1, otherwise `j` is 97.** 

The code snippet `s = ''` resets the value of `s` to an empty string, regardless of its initial value. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `k` is 1, `j` remains 97, and if `k` is not 1, `j` remains `k` + 96.
