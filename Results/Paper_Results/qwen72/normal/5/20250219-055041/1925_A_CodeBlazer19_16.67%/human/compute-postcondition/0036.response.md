The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `k + 97`. If `j` is less than `k + 97`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 97, and `k` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 98. The condition `k + 97` must still be greater than `j` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is 'a', `j` is 98, `k` must be greater than 1**
