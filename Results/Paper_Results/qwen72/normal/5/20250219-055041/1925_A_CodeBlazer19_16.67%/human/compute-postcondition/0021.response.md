The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the condition `j < k + 97`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 97 and `k` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 98. The condition `j < k + 97` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing. Since `k` must be at least 1, `k + 97` must be at least 98 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 'a', `j` is 98, `k` must be at least 1**
