Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the string containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a', `j` is `k` + 96.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `s` will contain a string of the first `k` letters of the alphabet, starting from 'a'. For example, if `k` is 5, `s` will be 'abcde'. The variable `j` will be equal to `k` + 96, which is the ASCII value of the last character added to `s` minus 1. The other variables (`n`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
