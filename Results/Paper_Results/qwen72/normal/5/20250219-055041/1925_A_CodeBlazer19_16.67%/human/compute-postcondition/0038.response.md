The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `k + 97`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 98 and `k` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than 1 to ensure that `j` is less than `k + 97`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is 'ab', `j` is 99, `k` must be greater than 1**
