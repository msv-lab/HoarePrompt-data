Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is an input string.
- The code `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` converts the string `a` into a list of integers by splitting the string at whitespace and converting each split part to an integer.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `a` is a list of integers, and the precondition that `a` is a list of integers is now valid.
