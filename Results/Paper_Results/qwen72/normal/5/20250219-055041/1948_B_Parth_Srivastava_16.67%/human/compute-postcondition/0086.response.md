Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(a)`, `x` is the last digit of the last processed element in `a` (if applicable), `y` is the integer part of the last processed element in `a` divided by 10 (if applicable), `n` is the total number of elements in `c`, `c` is a list of integers that has been populated based on the conditions in the loop, `d` is a sorted list of integers from `c`, and `c` is not equal to `d`.**
