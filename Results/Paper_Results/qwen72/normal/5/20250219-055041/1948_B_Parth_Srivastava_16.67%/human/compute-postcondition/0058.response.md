Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 1 or greater than 1. If `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10`, then `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10. If `y` <= `x`, `c` is a list with `y` and `x` appended to it, and `n` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `n` is increased by 1, and `c` now includes `a[i]` as its last element. If `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is 10 or less, `c` is a list that now includes the element `a[i]` appended to it, `x` and `y` are determined based on the new value of `a[i]` (if `i` is within the bounds of `a`), `n` is `n + 1`, and `c` and `x` and `y` are updated based on the new values of `x` and `y` as described in the conditions.***
