Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, `y` is 0.**

The variable `y` is initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `k`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
