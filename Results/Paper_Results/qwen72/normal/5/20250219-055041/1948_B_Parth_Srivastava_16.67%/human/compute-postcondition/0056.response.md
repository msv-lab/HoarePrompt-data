Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, `c` is a list that now includes the element `a[i]` appended to it, `x` and `y` are determined based on the new value of `a[i]` (if `i` is within the bounds of `a`), and `n` and `c` are updated based on the new values of `x` and `y` as described in the conditions.**
