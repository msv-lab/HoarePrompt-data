You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `a` derived from user input. It constructs a new list `c` by modifying elements of `a` that are greater than 10 according to specific rules. If an element in `a` is greater than 10, it is split into its last digit and the integer part of the element divided by 10. These parts are then added to `c` based on their relative values. The function then checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `b` to include the result of the sorting check for the processed list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It iterates `m` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - It iterates through each element of the array `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
       - It splits the element into two digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if the first digit `y` is less than or equal to the second digit `x`.
       - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` and increments `n` by 2.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c` and increments `n` by 1.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
       - It splits the element into two digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if the first digit `y` is less than or equal to the second digit `x`.
       - If the condition is met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` and increments `n` by 2.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c` and increments `n` by 1.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c` and increments `n` by 1.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - After transforming the array, it sorts the transformed array `c` and stores the sorted version in `d`.
   - It checks if the transformed array `c` is equal to the sorted array `d`.
   - If they are equal, it appends 1 to `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - Otherwise, it appends 0 to `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

4. **Output Handling:**
   - After processing all test cases, it iterates through the results stored in `b`.
   - It prints 'YES' if the result is 1 and 'NO' if the result is 0.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
  - The program splits the number into two digits and checks if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit. However, this logic is not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. Splitting `12` into `1` and `2` and `28` into `2` and `8` results in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which cannot be sorted.
  - The program should check if the array can be sorted after all possible splits, not just the first split.

- **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The function `func_1` should reset the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `c` for each test case, but it does not. This can lead to incorrect results if the variables retain values from previous test cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program has logical issues in the splitting and sorting checks, and it does not properly handle multiple test cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.
