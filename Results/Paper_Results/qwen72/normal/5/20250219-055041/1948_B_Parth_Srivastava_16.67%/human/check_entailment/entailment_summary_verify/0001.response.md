### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It iterates `m` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - It iterates through each element of the array `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
       - It splits the element into two digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if the first digit `y` is less than or equal to the second digit `x`.
       - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` and increments `n` by 2.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c` and increments `n` by 1.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
       - It splits the element into two digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if the first digit `y` is less than or equal to the second digit `x`.
       - If the condition is met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` and increments `n` by 2.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c` and increments `n` by 1.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c` and increments `n` by 1.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - After transforming the array, it sorts the transformed array `c` and stores the sorted version in `d`.
   - It checks if the transformed array `c` is equal to the sorted array `d`.
   - If they are equal, it appends 1 to `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - Otherwise, it appends 0 to `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

4. **Output Handling:**
   - After processing all test cases, it iterates through the results stored in `b`.
   - It prints 'YES' if the result is 1 and 'NO' if the result is 0.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
  - The program's logic for splitting and checking the digits is flawed. It only checks if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit and if the first digit is greater than or equal to the last element in `c`. This is not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. Splitting `12` into `1` and `2` and `28` into `2` and `8` results in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which cannot be sorted.
  - The program should consider all possible splits and check if the resulting array can be sorted, not just the first split.

- **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The function `func_1` does not reset the variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `c` for each test case. This can lead to incorrect results if the variables retain values from previous test cases.
  - For example, if the first test case modifies `c` and `n`, these values will be carried over to the next test case, potentially leading to incorrect transformations and comparisons.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has logical issues in the splitting and sorting checks, and it does not properly handle multiple test cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Final: **False**
