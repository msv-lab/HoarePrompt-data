The only objects in the loop head are `val_a` and `sec_arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `sec_arr` list. If `sec_arr` has at least two tuples, the loop can execute again for the second tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `sub_summ` is equal to `val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, and `val_a` is the first tuple in `sec_arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sec_arr` must have at least two tuples, and `val_a` will be the second tuple in `sec_arr`.

State: **`sub_summ` is equal to `val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `val_a` is the second tuple in `sec_arr`**
