You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Program:
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(putin())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

#Function 3:
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
    return sub_summ



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, and returns a single integer. The integer is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0. The input lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged after the function call.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses a custom function `putin()` to read input, which is not defined in the provided code. However, for the purpose of this evaluation, we can assume that `putin()` is a function that reads a line from standard input. This is a common practice in competitive programming to optimize input reading.
   - `func_1()` reads a single integer, which is the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of integers and returns them as a map of integers, which is then converted to a list.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b` for Alice's and Bob's item prices, respectively.
   - The program creates a list of tuples `main_ar` where each tuple is `(b_i - a_i, a_i)`. This list represents the profit Alice can make from each item if Bob buys it from her.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The program sorts the `main_ar` list in descending order based on the profit `(b_i - a_i)`.
   - Alice will choose the top `n - k` items from this sorted list because Bob will take the `k` items with the highest profit for free.
   - The program then calculates the total profit by summing the profits of the `n - k` items and the costs of the `k` items that Bob takes for free.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The function `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)` is responsible for calculating the profit.
   - `sub_summ` is initialized to 0.
   - The program adds the costs of the `k` items that Bob takes for free to `sub_summ`.
   - It then adds the profits of the `n - k` items that Bob buys from Alice to `sub_summ`.
   - The condition `if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0` ensures that only items with non-negative profit are considered, which is correct because Alice would not buy items that result in a loss.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The logic for calculating the profit is sound and aligns with the problem statement.
- The use of sorting and the condition to ensure non-negative profit is appropriate for the given constraints and problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
