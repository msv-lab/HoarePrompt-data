The only objects in the loop head are `val_b` and `main_ar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `main_ar`. If `main_ar` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of the first tuple in `main_ar` if that sum is greater than or equal to 0.
- If `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` is further increased by the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b`.
- `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`.
- `main_ar` must have at least two elements, with `val_b` being the second element in `main_ar`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `main_ar` must have at least three elements.
- `val_b` will be the third element in `main_ar`.

State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of the first tuple in `main_ar` if that sum is greater than or equal to 0, plus the sum of the first and second elements of the second tuple in `main_ar` if that sum is greater than or equal to 0. `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `main_ar` must have at least three elements, with `val_b` being the third element in `main_ar`.**
