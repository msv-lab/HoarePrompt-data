Output State: **`sub_summ` is equal to `3 * val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `val_a` is the third tuple in `sec_arr`**. 

The value of `sub_summ` is updated to `3 * val_a[0]` by adding `val_a[0]` to its previous value, which was `2 * val_a[0]`. The states of `sec_arr` and `val_a` remain unchanged.
