Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the case where the string is already sorted, which should have a cost of 0. Additionally, the logic for calculating the cost is flawed. For example, consider the string "101011". The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 5, but the program will output 6. This is because the program incorrectly adds the cost for each '0' encountered after a '1', without considering the optimal way to sort the string.

To illustrate the issue, let's break down the string "101011":
- The first '0' after the first '1' will add 2 to the cost.
- The second '0' after the second '1' will add 3 to the cost.
- The third '0' after the third '1' will add 4 to the cost.

The total cost calculated by the program is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9, but the correct minimum cost should be 5, which can be achieved by cyclically shifting the substring "1010" to "0101" and then shifting "01011" to "00111".

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
