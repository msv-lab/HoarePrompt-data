### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning step by step:

1. **Handling Already Sorted Strings:**
   - The function `func_1` does not account for the case where the string is already sorted. According to the problem description, if the string is already sorted in non-descending order, the cost should be 0. However, the current implementation will still add costs even if the string is already sorted.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
   - The logic in `func_1` for calculating the cost is flawed. The function adds `n + 1` to the cost every time it encounters a '0' after a '1'. This approach does not consider the optimal way to sort the string.
   - For example, consider the string "101011":
     - The first '0' after the first '1' will add 2 to the cost.
     - The second '0' after the second '1' will add 3 to the cost.
     - The third '0' after the third '1' will add 4 to the cost.
   - The total cost calculated by the program is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9, but the correct minimum cost should be 5, which can be achieved by cyclically shifting the substring "1010" to "0101" and then shifting "01011" to "00111".

3. **Optimal Cost Calculation:**
   - The correct approach to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string involves finding the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move all '1's to the end of the string.
   - One way to achieve this is to count the number of '1's and '0's, and then find the minimum number of operations needed to group all '1's together. This can be done by finding the longest contiguous segment of '1's and calculating the cost based on the number of '0's that need to be moved.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified in the reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases and the cost calculation logic is flawed.

Final: **False**
