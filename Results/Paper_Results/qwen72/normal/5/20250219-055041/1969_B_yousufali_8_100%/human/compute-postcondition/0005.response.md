The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` (the loop variable) is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1, and `func_1()` has been called twice. Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly tracked, we can infer that it is incremented by 1 each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `func_1()` has been called twice.**
