Postcondition: ***`s` is a new binary string input by the user, with a length of at least 2; `i` is 2; `n` is either 0 or 1. If the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is not 0, `ans` is updated as follows: if `n` is 1, `ans` is 5; if `n` is not 0, `ans` is `2n + 2`. If the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 0, `ans` remains 0 unless the first character of `s` is '0', in which case `ans` is 4. If the third character of `s` is '1', `n` is incremented by 1 from its initial value, and `ans` remains 0 unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` was initially 1, in which case `ans` is 2.***
