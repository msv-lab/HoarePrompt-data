Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a new binary string input by the user, with a length of at least 2; `n` is 0; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == '1':
        n += 1
    if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
        ans += n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a new binary string input by the user, with a length of at least 2; `i` is 0; `n` is 0 if the first character of `s` is not '1', otherwise `n` is 1; `ans` is 0 unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 1, in which case `ans` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a new binary string input by the user, with a length of at least 2; `i` is 1; `n` is 0 if the first character of `s` is not '1', otherwise `n` is 1 if the second character of `s` is not '1', and `n` is 2 if the second character of `s` is '1'. If `s[i]` (i.e., the second character of `s`) is '0' and `n` is not 0, `ans` is `n + 1` unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 1, in which case `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 1, in which case `ans` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a new binary string input by the user, with a length of at least 2; `i` is 2; `n` is either 0 or 1. If the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is not 0, `ans` is updated as follows: if `n` is 1, `ans` is 5; if `n` is not 0, `ans` is `2n + 2`. If the third character of `s` is '0' and `n` is 0, `ans` remains 0 unless the first character of `s` is '0', in which case `ans` is 4. If the third character of `s` is '1', `n` is incremented by 1 from its initial value, and `ans` remains 0 unless the first character of `s` is '0' and `n` was initially 1, in which case `ans` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
