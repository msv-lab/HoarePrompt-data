Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will have completed all its iterations if the input integer `t` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop was supposed to run. The function `func_1()` will have been called exactly `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer provided to the function `func_2()`.
