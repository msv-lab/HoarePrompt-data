Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a new binary string input by the user, with a length of at least 2.
   - `i` is `len(s) - 1`, which is the index of the last character in the string `s`.
   - `n` is the number of '1's in `s`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that follows at least one '1'.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - We need to count the number of '0's in `s` that come after at least one '1'.
   - For each such '0', we add `n + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `s = "101010"`.
     - `n` (number of '1's) = 3.
     - '0's that follow at least one '1' are at indices 1, 3, and 5.
     - For each of these '0's, we add `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - `ans = (3 + 1) + (3 + 1) + (3 + 1) = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`.

4. **General Case:**
   - If `s` has `k` '0's that follow at least one '1', then `ans` will be `k * (n + 1)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` calculated as described above.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of (n + 1) for each '0' in s that follows at least one '1', and n is the number of '1's in s)**
