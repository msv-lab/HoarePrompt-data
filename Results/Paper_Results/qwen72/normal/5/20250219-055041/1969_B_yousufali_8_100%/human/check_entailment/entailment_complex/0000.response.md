### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1`:**
     - This function reads a binary string `s` from user input.
     - It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of '1's in the string.
     - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
     - The function iterates over each character in the string `s`.
       - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
       - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it increments `ans` by `n + 1`.
     - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

   - **`func_2`:**
     - This function reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases.
     - It then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times, once for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **`func_1` Logic:**
     - The function correctly counts the number of '1's (`n`) in the string.
     - The function correctly calculates the cost for each '0' that follows at least one '1' by adding `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - However, the logic for calculating the cost is not entirely correct. The cost should be the length of the substring being shifted, not `n + 1`. The correct cost for each '0' that follows at least one '1' should be the length of the substring from the first '1' to the current '0'.

   - **Example Verification:**
     - For the string "10", the correct cost is 2 (shift the entire string).
     - For the string "0000", the correct cost is 0 (no shifts needed).
     - For the string "11000", the correct cost is 9 (shifts as described in the problem).
     - For the string "101011", the correct cost is 5 (shifts as described in the problem).
     - For the string "01101001", the correct cost is 11 (shifts as described in the problem).

   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for each '0' that follows at least one '1'. It should calculate the length of the substring from the first '1' to the current '0' and add that to `ans`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
