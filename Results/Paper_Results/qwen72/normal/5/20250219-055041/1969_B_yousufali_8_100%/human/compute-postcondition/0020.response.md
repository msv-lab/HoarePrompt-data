Output State: **`s` is a new binary string input by the user, with a length of at least 2; `i` is `len(s) - 1`; `n` is the number of '1's in `s`; `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that follows at least one '1'.**

Explanation:
- `s` remains unchanged as it is the input binary string.
- `i` is the loop index, which will be `len(s) - 1` after the loop has completed all iterations.
- `n` is incremented by 1 each time a '1' is encountered in `s`, so after the loop, `n` will be the total number of '1's in `s`.
- `ans` is incremented by `n + 1` each time a '0' is encountered in `s` and `n` is not 0. This means `ans` will be the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1' in `s`. If there are no '0's following any '1's, `ans` will remain 0.
