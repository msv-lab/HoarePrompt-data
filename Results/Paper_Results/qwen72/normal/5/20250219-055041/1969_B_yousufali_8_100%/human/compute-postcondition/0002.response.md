Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0
```
func_1()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

Since the function `func_1()` is called, but its definition is not provided, we cannot determine how it affects the variables or the program state. However, the initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged unless `func_1()` modifies it, which we cannot assume.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called.**
