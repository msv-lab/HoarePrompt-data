The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a pair of integers `x` and `n`. It then computes the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` (where `k = x // n`), and prints this value. If no such divisor exists or if `k` is 1, it prints 1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i` retain their last values from the final test case. The variable `ans` holds the maximum divisor found for the last test case, which is either 1, `i`, or `x // i` if they are less than or equal to `k`.
