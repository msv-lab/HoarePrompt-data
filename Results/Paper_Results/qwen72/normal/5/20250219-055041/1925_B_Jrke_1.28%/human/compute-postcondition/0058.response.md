Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list containing `[ans]` if `i` > `k`, and `l` is a list containing `[ans, i]` if `i` <= `k`. `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`.***
