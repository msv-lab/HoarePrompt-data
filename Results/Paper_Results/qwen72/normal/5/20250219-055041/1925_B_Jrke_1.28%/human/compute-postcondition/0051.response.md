Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)` and `x % i == 0`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `x // i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

The code `l.append(x // i)` adds the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
