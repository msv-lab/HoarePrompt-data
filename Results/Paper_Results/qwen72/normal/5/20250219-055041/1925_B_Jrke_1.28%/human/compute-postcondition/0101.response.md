Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x) + 4`, `ans` is 1, and `l` is a list containing the values [1, `int(x) + 4`].**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is `int(x) + 4`, the list `l` now contains the values [1, `int(x) + 4`]. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
