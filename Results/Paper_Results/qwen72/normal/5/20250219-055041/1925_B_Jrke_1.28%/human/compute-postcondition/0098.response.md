Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x) + 2`, and `ans` is 1. If `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, and `l` contains the value 1. If `x // (int(x) + 2) <= k`, `l` also contains the value `x // (int(x) + 2)`. If `i` <= `k`, `l` also contains the value `int(x) + 2`. If `x % i != 0`, the list `l` remains unchanged and `ans` is still 1.***
