Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x) + 4`, `ans` is 1, and `l` is a list containing the values [1, `int(x) + 4`, `x // i`].**

Explanation:
- The value of `x // i` is calculated and appended to the list `l`.
- The list `l` initially contains the value 1.
- If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` was updated to contain the values [1, `int(x) + 4`].
- The new value `x // i` is appended to `l`, making it [1, `int(x) + 4`, `x // i`].
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
