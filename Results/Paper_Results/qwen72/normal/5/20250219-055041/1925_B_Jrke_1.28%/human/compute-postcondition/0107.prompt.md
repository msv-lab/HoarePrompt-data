Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x)` (where `x` is the new first integer input), `ans` is 1. If `k` == 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x)` (where `x` is the new first integer input), `ans` is 1. If `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x // i <= k`, the list `l` contains the values 1, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains only the values 1 and `i`. If `x % i != 0`, the list `l` remains unchanged and `ans` is still 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x) + 2`, and `ans` is 1. If `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, and `l` contains the value 1. If `x // (int(x) + 2) <= k`, `l` also contains the value `x // (int(x) + 2)`. If `i` <= `k`, `l` also contains the value `int(x) + 2`. If `x % i != 0`, the list `l` remains unchanged and `ans` is still 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x) + 4`, and `ans` is 1. If `x % i == 0`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, and `l` is a list containing the values [1, `int(x) + 4`, `x // i`] if `x // i` <= `k`, otherwise `l` contains the values [1, `int(x) + 4`]. If `x % i != 0`, the list `l` remains unchanged and `ans` is still 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
