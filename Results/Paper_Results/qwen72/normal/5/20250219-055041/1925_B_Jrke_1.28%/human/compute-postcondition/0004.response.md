Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the input, where both values are integers and `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`.
   - `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`).
   - The current value of `k` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(1)` statement is straightforward. It prints the integer value 1.
   - The value of `k` being 1 is given as part of the initial state, but this information is not used in the `print` statement.
   - The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` are also provided in the initial state, but they do not affect the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer value 1, regardless of the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, or `k`.

Output: **1**
