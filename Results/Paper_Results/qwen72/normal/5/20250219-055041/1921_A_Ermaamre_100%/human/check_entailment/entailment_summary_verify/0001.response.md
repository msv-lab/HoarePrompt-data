### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square and stores them in a list `a` of lists, where each inner list contains the coordinates of one corner.

2. **Extracting X-Coordinates:**
   - The program then extracts the x-coordinates from the list `a` and stores them in a list `x`.

3. **Calculating the Side Length:**
   - The side length of the square is calculated by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). This approach is valid because the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the x-coordinates of the corners will span the entire width of the square.

4. **Calculating the Area:**
   - The area of the square is correctly calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The program's approach to calculating the side length using only the x-coordinates is valid. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will indeed give the side length of the square.
  - Similarly, the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates would also give the side length, but using the x-coordinates alone is sufficient because the side length is the same in both dimensions.
  - The area of the square is correctly calculated as the side length squared.

- **Handling of Input and Output:**
  - The program correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases and then the coordinates for each test case.
  - The output format is also correct, printing the area for each test case.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The problem guarantees that the input will always form a valid square with positive area, so there are no edge cases to handle where the input might not form a square.
