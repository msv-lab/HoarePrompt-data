Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of a square. It then calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the square's sides are parallel to the axes and the difference in x-coordinates will be the same as the difference in y-coordinates). Finally, it prints the area of the square by squaring the side length.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The problem states that the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and the coordinates of the corners are given in random order. The program assumes that the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will always give the side length of the square. This is correct because for a square with sides parallel to the axes, the difference in x-coordinates between the farthest points will always equal the difference in y-coordinates between the farthest points.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
