### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square and stores them in a list `a` of lists, where each inner list contains the coordinates of one corner.

2. **Extracting X-Coordinates:**
   - The program extracts the x-coordinates from the list `a` and stores them in a list `x`.

3. **Calculating the Side Length:**
   - The side length of the square is calculated by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). This works because the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the x-coordinates of the corners will span the entire width of the square.
   - However, the program only uses the x-coordinates to calculate the side length. This is a valid approach because the problem guarantees that the input forms a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, meaning the difference in x-coordinates will be the same as the difference in y-coordinates.

4. **Calculating the Area:**
   - The area of the square is then calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.
   - This is correct because the area of a square is the side length squared.

5. **Handling of Input and Output:**
   - The program correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases and then the coordinates for each test case.
   - The output format is also correct, printing the area for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The problem guarantees that the input will always form a valid square with positive area, so there are no edge cases to handle where the input might not form a square.
   - The program does not need to handle cases where the coordinates are not in a valid order or do not form a square, as these are not possible given the problem constraints.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The function should take an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it should read the coordinates of the four corners of the square, which are guaranteed to form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.

- **State After Reading Coordinates:**
  - `a` is a 4x2 list of integers, where each inner list contains the coordinates of one corner of the square.

- **State After Extracting X-Coordinates:**
  - `x` is a list containing the x-coordinates of the four corners.

- **State After Calculating Side Length:**
  - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which is the side length of the square.

- **State After Calculating and Printing Area:**
  - The area of the square is correctly calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.
