Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `a` is a 4xN list of integers where N is the number of integers input on each line, `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`, `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**

Explanation:
- The code `dx = max(x) - min(x)` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.
- The value of `dx` is updated to this calculated difference.
- The states of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of the new value of `dx`.
