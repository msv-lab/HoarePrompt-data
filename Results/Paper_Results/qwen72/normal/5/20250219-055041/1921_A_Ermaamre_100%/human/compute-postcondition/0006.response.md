The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute one more time if `t` is greater than the current value of `_`.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `t`.

Given that `t` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 0, and `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `a` is a 4xN list of integers where N is the number of integers input on each line, `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`, `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**
