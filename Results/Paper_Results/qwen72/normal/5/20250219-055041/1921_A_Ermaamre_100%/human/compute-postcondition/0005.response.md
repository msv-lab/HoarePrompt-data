Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration.
   - `a` is a 4xN list of integers, where N is the number of integers input on each line.
   - `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`.
   - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(dx * dx)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `a` is a 4xN list of integers. This means `a` has 4 sublists, each containing N integers.
   - `x` is a list that contains the first element of each sublist in `a`. Therefore, `x` will have 4 elements, each being the first integer from the corresponding sublist in `a`.
   - `dx` is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`. This means `dx = max(x) - min(x)`.
   - The `print(dx * dx)` statement will print the square of `dx`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `x` contains 4 integers, `dx` will be the difference between the largest and smallest of these 4 integers.
   - The value printed will be `dx * dx`, which is the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`, and `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`)**
