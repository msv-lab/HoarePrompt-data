Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `_` is 1.
3. `a` is a 4xN list of integers, where N is the number of integers input on each line.
4. `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`.
5. `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(dx * dx)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a`**:
   - `a` is a 4xN list of integers. This means `a` is a list containing 4 sublists, each of which has N integers.
   - For example, if N is 3, `a` might look like:
     ```python
     a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
     ```

2. **Extracting `x`**:
   - `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`.
   - Continuing with the example above, `x` would be:
     ```python
     x = [1, 4, 7, 10]
     ```

3. **Calculating `dx`**:
   - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.
   - For the example `x = [1, 4, 7, 10]`, the maximum value is 10 and the minimum value is 1.
   - Therefore, `dx` would be:
     ```python
     dx = 10 - 1 = 9
     ```

4. **Calculating `dx * dx`**:
   - The `print` statement will print the square of `dx`.
   - For the example, `dx * dx` would be:
     ```python
     dx * dx = 9 * 9 = 81
     ```

### Final Output:
The `print(dx * dx)` statement will print the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`, where `x` contains the first elements of each sublist in the 4xN list `a`.
Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `dx * dx`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`, and `x` contains the first elements of each sublist in the 4xN list `a`)**
