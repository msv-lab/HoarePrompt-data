Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `a - 2`, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, and `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`. If any element in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[a-2]` was less than 0 during the loop, the loop would have terminated early with a 'NO' output. If `b[-1]` or `b[-2]` are not 0 after the loop, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.**
