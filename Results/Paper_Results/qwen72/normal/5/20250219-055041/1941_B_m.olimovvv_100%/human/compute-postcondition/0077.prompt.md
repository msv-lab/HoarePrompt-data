Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `a - 2`, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, and `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`. If any element in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[a-2]` was less than 0 during the loop, the loop would have terminated early with a 'NO' output. If `b[-1]` or `b[-2]` are not 0 after the loop, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, a - 2):
    if b[i] < 0:
        print('NO')
        break
    b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
    b[i + 2] -= b[i]
    b[i] -= b[i]
else:
    if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`, `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - b[0]`. If `b[0]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`, `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`, `b[3]` is `b[3] - b[1]`, `b[1]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`, `b[1]` is 0, `b[2]` is 0, `b[3]` is `b[3] - b[1] - 2 * b[2]`, `b[4]` is `b[4] - b[2]`. If `b[3]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
