To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The objects in the loop head are:
- The variable `_` (which is a placeholder and not used in the loop body).
- The `range` function, which depends on the result of `int(input())`.

The loop will execute if the result of `int(input())` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute based on the input provided, which should be a positive integer. Since `t` is already a positive integer, we can assume that the input provided is `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and `int(input())` must be `t` which is greater than 0.**
