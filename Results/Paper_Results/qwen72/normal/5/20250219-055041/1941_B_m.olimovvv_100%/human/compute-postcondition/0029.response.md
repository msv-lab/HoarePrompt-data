The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is greater than 2, because the range function will generate a sequence from 0 to `a - 3` (inclusive), and this sequence must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 3`. However, this state is not relevant to the loop head, and we cannot adjust it directly for the loop to execute. Instead, we need to ensure that `a` is at least 3 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` in the loop head will start at 0, as specified by the range function.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` must be at least 3, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0**
