Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` must be at least 3, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 0. If the first element of `b` (i.e., `b[0]`) is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues normally.***
