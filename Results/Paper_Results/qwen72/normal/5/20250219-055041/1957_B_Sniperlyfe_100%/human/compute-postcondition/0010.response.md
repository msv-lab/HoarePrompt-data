Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is `k - nums[2]`, `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\), `nums[1]` set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and `nums[2]` set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - nums[2]`.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The list `nums` remains the same, with `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\), `nums[1]` set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and `nums[2]` set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains valid.
