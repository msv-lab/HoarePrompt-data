Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial state, `k` is 0, and `nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and the subsequent elements are set to the minimum of the previous element plus 1 and the remaining value of `k` at each iteration until `k` becomes 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The value of `k` is initially reduced by \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) when `nums[0]` is set.
- For each iteration of the loop, starting from `i = 1`, the loop checks if `k` is greater than 0.
  - If `k` is greater than 0, `nums[i]` is set to the minimum of `nums[i-1] + 1` and `k`.
  - `k` is then reduced by the value of `nums[i]`.
- This process continues until `k` becomes 0, at which point the loop stops updating `nums[i]` and `k`.
- After the loop completes, `k` will be 0, and the list `nums` will have the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\), and the subsequent elements will be set to the minimum of the previous element plus 1 and the remaining value of `k` at each iteration.
