Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\), which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation is maximized.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k` and iterates over the remaining elements of `nums`.
   - For each subsequent element, it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`. This ensures that the values are as large as possible without exceeding `k`.
   - After the loop, if `k` is not fully used up, it adds the remaining value of `k` to the first element `nums[0]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them, which is correct according to the problem description.

4. **Verification of Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: The sum of the elements in `nums` should be equal to `k`.
     - The initial value of `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\), and the remaining value of `k` is distributed among the subsequent elements.
     - If `k` is not fully used up by the end of the loop, the remaining value is added to `nums[0]`, ensuring the sum is exactly `k`.
   - **Condition 2**: The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in `nums` should be maximized.
     - By setting `nums[0]` to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\), we maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the first element.
     - The subsequent elements are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`, which ensures that they do not introduce additional 1s beyond what is necessary to reach the sum `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n = 1`, the function correctly returns `[k]` because the only element must be `k`.
   - If `k` is small and `n` is large, the function correctly distributes `k` among the elements, ensuring the sum is `k` and the number of 1s is maximized.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to satisfy both conditions of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
