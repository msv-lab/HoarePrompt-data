Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is now `k - min(2^(k.bit_length() - 1), k)`, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{k.bit_length() - 1} - 1\) and the rest of the elements initialized to 0, `nums[1]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and the current value of `k` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated by subtracting `nums[i]` from its current value.
- Since `i` is 1, `nums[i]` refers to `nums[1]`.
- `nums[1]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.
- `nums[0]` is \(2^{k.bit_length() - 1} - 1\).
- Therefore, `nums[1]` is `min(2^{k.bit_length() - 1}, k)`.
- The new value of `k` is `k - min(2^{k.bit_length() - 1}, k)`.
- The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
