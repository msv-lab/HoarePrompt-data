Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's an analysis of why:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.
   - The results are collected and printed at the end.

2. **Sequence Construction in `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but all bits set to 1. This is done using the expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k` and distributes the remaining value of `k` among the other elements of the list, ensuring that the sum of the list equals `k`.
   - The distribution is done by setting each subsequent element to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`, and then subtracting this value from `k`.
   - Finally, any remaining value of `k` is added back to `nums[0]`.

3. **Maximizing the Number of 1s in the Binary Representation**:
   - By setting `nums[0]` to the largest number with the same number of bits as `k`, the program ensures that the binary representation of `nums[0]` has the maximum number of 1s possible for a single number.
   - The remaining values are distributed in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. This is because each subsequent number is set to a value that is as large as possible without exceeding the remaining sum, which helps in setting additional bits to 1.

4. **Correctness of the Output**:
   - The program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
   - The sequence is constructed to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

Given these points, the program satisfies the conditions of the problem and should produce correct outputs for the given constraints.
