The function `func_1` accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of the list is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\). Each subsequent element is the minimum of the previous element plus 1 and the remaining value of `k` at each iteration, until `k` becomes 0. If `k` is not fully used up by the end of the loop, the remaining value of `k` is added to the first element of the list. The final state of the program is that `nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1 + \text{remaining } k\) and the subsequent elements are set as described.
