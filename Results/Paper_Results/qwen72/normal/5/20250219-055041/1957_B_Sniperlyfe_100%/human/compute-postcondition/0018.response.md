Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1 + k\) and the subsequent elements are set to the minimum of the previous element plus 1 and the remaining value of `k` at each iteration until `k` becomes 0.**

Explanation:
- The first element of `nums` is calculated as \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1 + k\). Since `k` is 0, `k.bit_length()` is 1, so the first element is \(2^{1 - 1} - 1 + 0 = 2^0 - 1 + 0 = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0\).
- For the subsequent elements, the value is set to the minimum of the previous element plus 1 and the remaining value of `k`. Since `k` is 0, the remaining value of `k` is always 0, and the previous element plus 1 will be 1, 2, 3, etc.
- However, since `k` is 0, the minimum value will always be 0, so all subsequent elements will also be 0.
- Therefore, the list `nums` will be `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` with a length of `n`.
