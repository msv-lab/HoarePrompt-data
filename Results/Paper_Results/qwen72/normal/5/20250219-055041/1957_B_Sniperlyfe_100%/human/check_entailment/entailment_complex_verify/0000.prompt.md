You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `n` is the same as the initial state, `k` is 0, and `nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and the subsequent elements are set to the minimum of the previous element plus 1 and the remaining value of `k` at each iteration until `k` becomes 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1 + k\) and the subsequent elements are set to the minimum of the previous element plus 1 and the remaining value of `k` at each iteration until `k` becomes 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of the list is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\). Each subsequent element is the minimum of the previous element plus 1 and the remaining value of `k` at each iteration, until `k` becomes 0. If `k` is not fully used up by the end of the loop, the remaining value of `k` is added to the first element of the list. The final state of the program is that `nums` is a list of length `n` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1 + \text{remaining } k\) and the subsequent elements are set as described.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n`. According to the problem description, the sum of the sequence must be equal to `k`, and the sequence must contain `n` non-negative integers. If `k` is less than `n`, it is impossible to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 2
```
Here, `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The program will construct the sequence `[1, 1, 0]`, which sums up to 2, but the bitwise OR of the sequence is `1 | 1 | 0 = 1`, which has only one 1 in its binary representation. However, the optimal solution would be `[2, 0, 0]`, which also sums up to 2 and has the bitwise OR `2 | 0 | 0 = 2 = (10)_2`, which has one 1 in its binary representation. 

The program fails to consider the possibility of distributing the remaining `k` in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, especially when `k` is small compared to `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
