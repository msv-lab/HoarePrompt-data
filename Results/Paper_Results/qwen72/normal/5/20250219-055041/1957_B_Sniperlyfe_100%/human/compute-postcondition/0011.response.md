Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and the rest of the elements initialized to 0. If `k` > 0, `k` is updated to `k - min(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}}, k)`, and `nums[1]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged and `nums[1]` remains 0.***
