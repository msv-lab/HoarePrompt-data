Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is now `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1)`, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and the rest of the elements initialized to 0, and the current value of `k` is greater than 0.**
