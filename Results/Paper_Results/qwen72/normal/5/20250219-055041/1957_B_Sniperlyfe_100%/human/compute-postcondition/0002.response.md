Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and the rest of the elements initialized to 0, `k` is now `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\).
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - nums[0]`, which is `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1)`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
