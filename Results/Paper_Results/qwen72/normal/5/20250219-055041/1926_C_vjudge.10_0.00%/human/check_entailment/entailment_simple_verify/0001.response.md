### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `N` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `N` times, where it reads an integer `n` for each test case.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - For each test case, the program calculates the sum of the digits of all numbers from 0 to `n-1` (not from 1 to `n` as required) and adds this sum to a global variable `soma`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` converts the number `n` to a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and sums these integers.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

4. **Global Sum Variable:**
   - The variable `soma` is used to accumulate the sum of the digits for all test cases.
   - This is incorrect because the sum for each test case should be printed separately, not accumulated into a single global sum.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `soma` after processing all test cases.
   - This means that the sum of the digits for all test cases is printed as a single value, which does not match the problem's requirement to print the sum for each test case individually.

6. **Range Issue:**
   - The inner loop `for i in range(n)` iterates from 0 to `n-1`, but the problem requires the sum of digits from 1 to `n`.
   - This means the program is missing the sum of the digits of `n` itself.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle the output for each test case separately and it does not include the sum of the digits of `n` itself in the calculation.

Final: **False**
