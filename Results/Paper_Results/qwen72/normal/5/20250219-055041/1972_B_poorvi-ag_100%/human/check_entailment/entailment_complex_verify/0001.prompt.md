You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The function should also handle the input where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, and `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the number of occurrences of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is not relevant, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have exactly `t` elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It determines for each test case whether the number of "U" characters in the string is odd. If the number of "U" characters is odd, it appends 'yes' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in the results list. The function does not return any value, but the final state is that `results` contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, and `t` is the total number of test cases processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves a circle of `n` coins, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when no facing-up coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The goal is to determine if Alice (the first player) will win if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The game is a combinatorial game where the state of the game is determined by the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice.
   - This is because each move removes one facing-up coin and flips two adjacent coins, which does not change the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of facing-up coins.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It then counts the number of "U" coins using `arr.count('U')`.
   - If the count of "U" coins is odd, it appends "yes" to the results list, indicating that Alice will win.
   - If the count of "U" coins is even, it appends "no" to the results list, indicating that Bob will win.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The logic is sound and aligns with the optimal play strategy for both players.
   - The program handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description.
