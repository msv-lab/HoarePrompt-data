Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the total number of test cases, and it is given that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `i` is not relevant, which means its value is not defined or used in the context of the `print` statement.
   - `n` is the last input integer, and it is given that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `arr` is the last input string.
   - `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have at least one element.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the value of `i`.
   - According to the initial state, `i` is not relevant and its value is not defined or used in the context of the `print` statement.

Since `i` is not defined or relevant in the context of the `print` statement, the output will be the value of `i` as it is, which is undefined.

Output: **i (where i is not defined or relevant)**
