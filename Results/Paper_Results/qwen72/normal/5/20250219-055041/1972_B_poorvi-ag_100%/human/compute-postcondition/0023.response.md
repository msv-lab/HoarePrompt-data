The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `i` is `t - 1`, but since `i` is being used as an iterator variable in the loop, its initial value is not relevant to the loop's execution. The loop will iterate over each element in `results`.

To ensure the loop executes, `results` must have at least one element. The value of `i` as `t - 1` is not relevant to the loop's execution because `i` is reassigned by the loop.

State: **`t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is not relevant, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have at least one element**
