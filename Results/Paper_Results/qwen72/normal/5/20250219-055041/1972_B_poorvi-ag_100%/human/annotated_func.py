#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The function should also handle the input where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, and `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the number of occurrences of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `t` is the total number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is not relevant, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is the last input string, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case and must have exactly `t` elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It determines for each test case whether the number of "U" characters in the string is odd. If the number of "U" characters is odd, it appends 'yes' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in the results list. The function does not return any value, but the final state is that `results` contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, and `t` is the total number of test cases processed.
