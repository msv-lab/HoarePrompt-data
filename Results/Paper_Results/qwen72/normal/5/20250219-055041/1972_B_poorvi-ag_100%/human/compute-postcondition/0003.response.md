Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)**

The value of `n` is assigned the integer value provided by the user input, which must be a positive integer between 1 and 100. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
