### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a circle of coins, each of which can be either facing up ("U") or facing down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The goal is to determine if Alice (the first player) will win the game if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - The game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move to make, and she can force Bob into a losing position.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the initial state of the coins `arr`.
   - It then checks if the number of "U" coins in `arr` is odd or even using `arr.count('U') % 2`.
   - If the number of "U" coins is odd, it appends "yes" to the `results` list, indicating that Alice will win.
   - If the number of "U" coins is even, it appends "no" to the `results` list, indicating that Bob will win.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the input format and multiple test cases.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the number of "U" coins is correct.
   - The program outputs the results in the required format.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
