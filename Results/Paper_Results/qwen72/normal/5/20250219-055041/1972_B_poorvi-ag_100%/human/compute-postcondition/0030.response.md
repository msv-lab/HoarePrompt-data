The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The function should also handle an input where the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It returns the result for each test case, which is based on the initial state of the coins represented by `s`. The first input is the number of test cases `t`.**
