Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Input

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the firing rate `k` (bullets per second), followed by the healths of the monsters and their initial positions. It then determines if it is possible to defeat all the monsters by firing bullets at them, considering the time it takes for the bullets to reach each monster based on their positions. The function prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated within the available time, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
