The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `i` should be 0 to ensure the loop iterates correctly from the beginning.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
