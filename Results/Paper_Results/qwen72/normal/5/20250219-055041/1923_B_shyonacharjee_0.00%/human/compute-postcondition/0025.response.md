Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers input by the user, `positions` is a list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the initial `total_bullets_used` plus `bullets_needed`, `i` is 1, `position` is the first element of the second tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the second tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If the sum of `total_bullets_used` and `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `success` remains True.***
