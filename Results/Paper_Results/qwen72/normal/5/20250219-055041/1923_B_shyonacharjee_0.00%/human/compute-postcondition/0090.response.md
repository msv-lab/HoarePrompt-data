Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `position` and `health` are assigned the values from the first element of the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
