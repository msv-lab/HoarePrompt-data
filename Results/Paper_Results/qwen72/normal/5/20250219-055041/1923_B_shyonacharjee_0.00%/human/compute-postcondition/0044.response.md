Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `healths` is the list of integers input by the user, `positions` is the list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index of the last monster processed before the loop exited, `position` is the first element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `success` is True.**

The code snippet `success = True` sets the variable `success` to `True`, overriding any previous value it might have had. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
