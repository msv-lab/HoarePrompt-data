Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer, `healths` is the list of integers input by the user, `positions` is the list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `i` is 0, `position` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `success` is True.**

The code snippet `bullets_needed = health` assigns the value of `health` to `bullets_needed`. Since `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` now holds the same value as `health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
