Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem for every potential case. Specifically, the logic for counting the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake is flawed. The program only counts the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices and adds a fixed number of triangles based on the number of chosen vertices. This does not account for all possible configurations of vertices that can form triangles.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4 3 0
1 2 4
```
According to the problem description, the vertices 1, 2, and 4 are chosen. The program will count the gaps between these vertices and will output:
```
1
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
2
```
This is because the vertices 1, 2, and 4 form two non-intersecting triangles: (1, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 4).

The program fails to correctly count the number of triangles that can be formed, especially when the chosen vertices are not contiguous. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
