You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5

    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (y = 0), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
        
    #State: `T` is 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are input integers, `x` is greater than 1, `i` is `x - 2`, `list0` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` is exactly 1 for each test case. If `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1 for each test case. `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing chosen vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of times the difference between consecutive chosen vertices is exactly 1, plus `x - 2`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input has been fully processed, and the results for each test case have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We need to form non-intersecting diagonals using these vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces.
   - The constraint is that `y = 0`, meaning we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - In a regular polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting diagonals that can be drawn from `x` vertices is `x - 3` (since each triangle requires 3 vertices and each diagonal can form a new triangle).
   - However, the problem also considers the gaps between the chosen vertices. If the gap between two consecutive chosen vertices is 1, it means they are adjacent, and we can form a triangle with the next chosen vertex.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` (where `y` is always 0).
   - It then reads the list of `x` chosen vertices and sorts them.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and checks the gap between each pair of consecutive vertices. If the gap is 1, it increments the counter.
   - It also checks the gap between the last and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic).
   - Finally, it prints the result as `count + x - 2`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and counts the number of adjacent pairs.
   - The formula `count + x - 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of triangles. This is because:
     - `count` represents the number of triangles formed by adjacent vertices.
     - `x - 3` represents the number of triangles formed by non-adjacent vertices.
     - Adding these together gives `count + (x - 3) + 1 = count + x - 2`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x = 2` correctly by outputting 0 (since no triangles can be formed with only 2 vertices).
   - The program also handles the case where all vertices are chosen correctly by outputting `x - 2` (since every pair of consecutive vertices can form a triangle with the next vertex).

6. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(x \log x)\) due to sorting, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is \(O(x)\) for storing the list of chosen vertices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
