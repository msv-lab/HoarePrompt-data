### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen and sorts this list.

2. **Counting Triangles:**
   - The program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates over the sorted list of chosen vertices and checks the difference between consecutive vertices.
   - If the difference between consecutive vertices is exactly 1, it increments the `count` by 1. This is because a difference of 1 means there is a single vertex between them, which can form a triangle with the two chosen vertices.
   - After the loop, it calculates the difference between the first and last vertex in the list, considering the circular nature of the polygon. If this difference is 1, it also increments the `count` by 1.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is `count + x - 2`.
   - The term `x - 2` is added to the `count` because for any set of `x` chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly:
     - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`
     - `4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`
     - `2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)`
     - `y = 0`
   - The program ensures that the vertices are distinct and sorted, which is necessary for the correct calculation of the differences.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the number of triangles that can be formed by checking the differences between consecutive vertices and the circular difference.
   - The formula `count + x - 2` is correct for calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the constraints provided. It correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

### Correctness:
**True**
