Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `-1`**

The value of `mex` is updated to be equal to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
