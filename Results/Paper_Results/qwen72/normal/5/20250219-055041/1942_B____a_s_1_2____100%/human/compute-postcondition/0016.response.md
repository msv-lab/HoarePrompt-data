Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
4. `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
5. `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[n, p[n-1], p[n-2], ..., p[0]]`.
6. `i` is `-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*p)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mex`**:
   - `mex` is defined as the minimum value of the list `[n, p[n-1], p[n-2], ..., p[0]]`.
   - However, `p` is defined in terms of `mex`, which creates a circular dependency. To resolve this, we need to understand the initial conditions and how `mex` is determined.

2. **Initial Calculation of `p`**:
   - The list `p` is constructed such that each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.
   - Since `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[n, p[n-1], p[n-2], ..., p[0]]`, we need to determine the initial value of `mex` before constructing `p`.

3. **Initial Value of `mex`**:
   - The list `[n, p[n-1], p[n-2], ..., p[0]]` includes `n` and the elements of `p`.
   - The minimum value of `n` is 1, and since `p` is constructed based on `mex`, the initial value of `mex` must be 0 (the smallest non-negative integer) to avoid negative values in `p`.

4. **Constructing `p`**:
   - If `mex` is 0, then each element `p[i]` is `0 - a[i]`, which simplifies to `-a[i]`.
   - Therefore, `p` will be a list of the negated values of the elements in `a`.

5. **Final Value of `mex`**:
   - After constructing `p`, the minimum value of the list `[n, p[n-1], p[n-2], ..., p[0]]` will be the minimum of `n` and the elements of `p`.
   - Since `n` is at least 1 and the elements of `p` are negated values of `a`, the minimum value of `p` will be the smallest negative value in `p` (or 0 if all elements of `a` are 0).

6. **Output**:
   - The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.
   - Given that `p` is constructed as `p[i] = -a[i]` for each `i` from `n-1` to `0`, the output will be the negated values of the elements in `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-a[0] -a[1] ... -a[n-1] (where a is the list of integers input by the user)**
