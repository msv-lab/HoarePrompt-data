Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of reconstructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` where `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The key idea is to work backwards from the last element to the first, which is a valid approach because the MEX of the entire permutation is always `n` (since all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are used exactly once).

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`. This is correct because the MEX of the full permutation is `n`, as `n` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the permutation.

2. **Backward Construction**:
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0`. For each index `i`, the value `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
   - The `mex` is then updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This is correct because `p[i]` must be a valid number in the permutation, and the MEX of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` should be the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `p` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if `a` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program will correctly output `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` because the MEX of the prefix will always be the next smallest integer not yet used.

5. **Validation**:
   - The program ensures that the permutation `p` is valid by updating `mex` appropriately. The MEX of the prefix is always the smallest non-negative integer not in the prefix, and the program correctly reconstructs `p` by ensuring that `p[i]` is the correct value to satisfy the equation `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, the program appears to be correct and should produce a valid permutation `p` for the given `a`.

Correctness: **True**
