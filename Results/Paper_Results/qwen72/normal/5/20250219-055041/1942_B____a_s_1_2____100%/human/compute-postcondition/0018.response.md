Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0`, `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[n, p[n-1], p[n-2], ..., p[0]]`, `i` is `-1`**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. The new value of `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
