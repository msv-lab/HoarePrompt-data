Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[n, p[n-1], p[n-2], ..., p[0]]`, `i` is `-1`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
- The code `p = [-1] * n` reassigns `p` to be a new list of length `n` where each element is `-1`.
- The value of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains `-1`.
- The value of `mex` is still defined as the minimum value of the list `[n, p[n-1], p[n-2], ..., p[0]]`, but since `p` is now a list of `-1` values, `mex` will be the minimum of `n` and `-1`. Since `n` is always positive and greater than or equal to 1, `mex` will be `-1`.
