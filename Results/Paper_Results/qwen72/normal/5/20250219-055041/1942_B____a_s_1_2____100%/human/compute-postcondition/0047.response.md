Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0`, `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[mex, p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-1]]`, and `i` is `-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it is only used to define the range of the loop.
- The list `a` remains unchanged as it is only read and not modified within the loop.
- The list `p` is now fully populated. Each element `p[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
- The variable `mex` is updated to the minimum value found among the initial `mex` and all the elements in the list `p`.
- The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop completes, as the loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0` and then `i` is decremented one more time.
