Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `n - 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]`.
- Since `i` is `n - 1`, the last element of the list `p` is now `mex - a[n-1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
