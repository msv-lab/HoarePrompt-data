Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]` and `p[i]` which is `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is `min(n, mex - a[n-1])`, `i` is `n - 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]`.
- The initial state specifies that `i` is `n - 2`, so `p[n-2]` is now `mex - a[n-2]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mex`) and the rest of the list `p` remain unchanged.
