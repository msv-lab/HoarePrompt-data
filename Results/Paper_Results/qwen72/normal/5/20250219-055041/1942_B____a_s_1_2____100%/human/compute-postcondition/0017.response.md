The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range defined by `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, and the value of `_` is not used within the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `t` must be such that it is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and since the loop has just completed one iteration, `t` must now be at least 1 (it was originally at least 2). The variable `i` is `-1`, but it is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0`, `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[n, p[n-1], p[n-2], ..., p[0]]`, `i` is `-1`**
