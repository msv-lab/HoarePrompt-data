To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`: This is the loop variable.
   - `n`: This is the upper bound of the range, and it determines the number of iterations.

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` is not empty.
   - The range `range(start, stop, step)` will be non-empty if `start` is greater than or equal to `stop` when `step` is negative.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `mex` is `n` (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `i` is `-1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1` when the step is `-1`.
   - This means `n - 1` must be at least 0, which implies `n` must be at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` should be `n - 1` to start the loop correctly.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop can execute.
- `i` should be `n - 1` to start the loop correctly.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, `mex` is `n`, `i` is `n - 1`**
