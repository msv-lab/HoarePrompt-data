Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, and `ans` retains its value from the previous iteration.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` updates the value of `nums`.
- `arr[i - 1]` is the first element of the list `arr` (since `i` is 1).
- The digits of `arr[i - 1]` are extracted and converted to integers, forming a list.
- This list is then concatenated with a list containing the integer `arr[i]`.
- The value of `ans` is not affected by this code snippet and retains its value from the previous iteration.
- The values of `n`, `_`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
