You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) with elements in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. For each test case, it determines if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. If the array can be sorted in this manner, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been evaluated and the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed for each.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption**: The program starts by assuming the array can be sorted (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Iteration**: The program iterates through the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`). This is a good approach because it allows the program to check and potentially modify elements that might affect the sorting of the array.

4. **Condition Check**: For each element, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`. If this condition is true, it means the array is not sorted at this point, and the program needs to determine if the operation can fix this.

5. **Operation Simulation**: If the array is not sorted at `arr[i - 1]`, the program simulates the operation by converting `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appending the current element `arr[i]` to this list of digits. It then checks if this list of digits is sorted.

6. **Early Termination**: If the list of digits is not sorted, the program sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop, as it is impossible to sort the array with the given operation.

7. **Final Output**: After processing all elements, the program prints `YES` if `ans` is still `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:

- **Flaw in Operation Simulation**: The program only checks if the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the current element `arr[i]` can be sorted. This is insufficient because the operation can potentially split `arr[i - 1]` into multiple digits, and these digits might need to be inserted in the correct positions to ensure the entire array is sorted. The program does not account for the correct placement of these digits in the array.

For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`:
- The program will check `28` and `12` and see that `28` is greater than `12`.
- It will then split `12` into `[1, 2]` and append `28` to it, resulting in `[1, 2, 28]`.
- The program checks if `[1, 2, 28]` is sorted, which it is, and continues.
- However, the correct operation would split `12` into `[1, 2]` and insert these digits in the correct positions, resulting in `[1, 2, 5, 28]`, which is sorted.

The program does not handle the correct insertion of digits into the array, which is necessary to ensure the array can be sorted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
