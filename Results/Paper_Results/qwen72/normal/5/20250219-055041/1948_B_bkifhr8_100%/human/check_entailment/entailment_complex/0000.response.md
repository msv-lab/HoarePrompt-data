### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Logic for Sorting**:
   - The function iterates over the array from the second last element to the first element.
   - If it finds an element that is greater than the next element (`arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`), it attempts to split the larger element (`arr[i - 1]`) into its constituent digits and appends the next element (`arr[i]`) to this list.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - It also handles the case where the array contains elements that are less than 10, as these elements cannot be split further.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function only checks the immediate next element (`arr[i]`) when it finds an element that is greater than the next element.
   - It does not consider the possibility of splitting `arr[i - 1]` and re-evaluating the entire array to see if it can be sorted.
   - For example, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the function will split `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]` and then check if `[1, 2, 28, 5]` is sorted, which it is not. However, if `28` is split into `[2, 8, 5]`, the array can be sorted as `[1, 2, 5, 8]`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function's logic is flawed because it does not fully explore the possibility of splitting elements and re-evaluating the array.
   - The function should recursively or iteratively split elements and check if the array can be sorted after each split.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The function does not correctly handle all cases where splitting elements can lead to a sorted array. It only checks the immediate next element and does not consider the full impact of splitting elements and re-evaluating the array.
