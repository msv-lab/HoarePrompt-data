#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) with elements in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The function should determine if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. The input is expected to be provided in a specific format with the first line containing the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), followed by `t` test cases, each with two lines: the first line containing `n` and the second line containing the `n` integers of the array `a`.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True if the loop completes without breaking for all iterations, or False if the loop breaks due to `nums` not being sorted in any of the iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) with elements in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. For each test case, it determines if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. If the array can be sorted in this manner, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been evaluated and the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed for each.
