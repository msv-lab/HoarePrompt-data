Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is a placeholder, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the first element of `arr` followed by the second element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- `nums` is created by converting the first element of `arr` (which is `arr[0]`) to a string, then splitting it into individual digits, converting each digit back to an integer, and finally adding the second element of `arr` (which is `arr[1]`) to the end of this list.
- The second element of `arr` is less than the first element of `arr`, so `nums` will contain the digits of the first element followed by the second element.
- All other variables (`n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
