The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer array `a` of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) with elements in the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. For each test case, it determines if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits. If the array can be sorted in this manner, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been evaluated and the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed for each.
