To determine what will be printed by the `print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions that affect the variable `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code snippet).
- `m` is greater than 1.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` is initially set to True.
- The loop updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` during the loop.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates through the list `arr` starting from index 1 (i.e., `i = 1`).
2. **Comparison**: For each iteration, the code checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`.
3. **Update**: If the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]`.
4. **ans Update**: If the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true at any point, `ans` is set to False.

### Possible Outcomes:
- If the loop completes without finding any `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True.
- If the loop finds any `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and updates `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to False.

### Final Output:
- If `ans` is True, the output will be 'YES'.
- If `ans` is False, the output will be 'NO'.

Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` without knowing the specific elements of `arr`. However, based on the conditions described, the print statement will output either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the loop found any `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and updated `arr[i - 1]`.

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where 'NO' is printed if any `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` during the loop, otherwise 'YES' is printed)**
