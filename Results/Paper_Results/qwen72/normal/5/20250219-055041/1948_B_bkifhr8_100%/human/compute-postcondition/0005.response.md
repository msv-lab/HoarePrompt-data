The objects in the loop head are `i`, `m`, and the parameters of the `range` function. The loop will execute if `m - 1` is greater than 0, and it will decrement `i` by 1 until `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at `m - 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`**
