#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, where 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both a and b are odd.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #An error occurs because `a` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into `x` and `y`. The program does not return any value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are odd integers between 3 and 99, inclusive. However, the function results in an error because it attempts to unpack the integer `a` into `x` and `y`, which is not valid. As a result, the function does not return any value.
