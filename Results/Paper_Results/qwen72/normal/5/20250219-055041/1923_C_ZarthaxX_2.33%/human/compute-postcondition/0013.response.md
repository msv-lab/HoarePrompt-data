Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 300,000.
- The variable `q` remains a non-negative integer within the range 1 to 300,000.
- The list `c` remains a list of positive integers with length `n`.
- The list `nums` remains a list of integers with length `n`.
- The list `ones` is now populated such that `ones[i]` contains the number of 1s in the `nums` list from the start up to the index `i - 1`.
- The list `sum` is now populated such that `sum[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the values in the `nums` list from the start up to the index `i - 1`, with each value decremented by 1.
