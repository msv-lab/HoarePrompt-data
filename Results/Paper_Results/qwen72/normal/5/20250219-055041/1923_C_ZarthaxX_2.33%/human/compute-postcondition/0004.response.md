The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. To ensure the loop executes, the range of `i` must be from 1 to `n + 1`. This means `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5)
- `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5)
- `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`
- `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`
- `ones` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`
- `sum` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`

The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `i` is 1**
