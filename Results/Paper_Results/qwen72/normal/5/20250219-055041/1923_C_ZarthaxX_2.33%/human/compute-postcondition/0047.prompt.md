Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in `nums` from index `l` to `r - 1`, `sumInRange` is the value of `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be greater than 0, `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l == r`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition is satisfied. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`, the condition is not satisfied. In both cases, `q` is now `q - 1` and must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be greater than 1, `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`, the program continues as specified. Otherwise, the program also continues as specified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
