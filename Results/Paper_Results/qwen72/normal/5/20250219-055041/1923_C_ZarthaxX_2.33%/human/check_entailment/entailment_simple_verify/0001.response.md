### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays**:
   - The `ones` array is used to store the cumulative count of 1s in the array `nums`.
   - The `sum` array is used to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` for each index `i`.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program correctly updates the `ones` array by adding 1 to the previous count if the current element is 1.
   - The `sum` array is updated by adding `nums[i - 1] - 1` to the previous sum. This is because the sum of `b` should be equal to the sum of `a`, and `b_i` must be positive and different from `a_i`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is good.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, and it cannot be good because there is no way to find a different positive integer `b_i` that satisfies the conditions.
   - The program calculates the number of 1s in the subarray using `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - It also calculates the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for the subarray using `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

5. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`.
   - This condition ensures that the sum of `b` can be made equal to the sum of `a` by changing each `a_i` to a different positive integer `b_i` such that `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i`.
   - The term `2 * onesInRange` accounts for the fact that each 1 in `a` needs to be changed to at least 2 in `b` to ensure `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i`.
   - The term `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` accounts for the remaining elements in the subarray that are not 1s. Each of these elements can be changed to a different positive integer that is not equal to itself.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints `YES` if the subarray is good and `NO` otherwise.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Input Handling**:
  - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, which is appropriate.

- **Correctness of Auxiliary Arrays**:
  - The `ones` array is correctly initialized and updated to store the cumulative count of 1s.
  - The `sum` array is correctly initialized and updated to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1`.

- **Correctness of Query Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `l == r` by printing `NO`.
  - The calculation of `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` is correct.
  - The condition check `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is correct and ensures that the subarray can be transformed into a good array.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The preprocessing and query handling are efficient and handle the constraints appropriately.

Final: **True**
