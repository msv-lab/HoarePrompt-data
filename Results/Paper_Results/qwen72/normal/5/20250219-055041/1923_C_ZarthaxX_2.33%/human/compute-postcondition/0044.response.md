The given Python code snippet is simply a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides a detailed context about the variables and objects involved, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

Output: **YES**
