To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5).
   - `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`.
   - `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`.
   - `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.
   - `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `l == r`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
   - Otherwise, if `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition is satisfied.
   - Otherwise, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`.
   - `q` is now `q - 1` and must be greater than 0.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print('YES')` is executed.

Given the conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will be executed if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange` is satisfied. This condition can be simplified as follows:
\[ 2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} = \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \]

So, the condition becomes:
\[ \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange} \]

If this condition is true, the program will print 'YES'. If the condition is false, the program will not print anything (or it might print 'NO' if there is a corresponding print statement for the false case, but that is not provided in the given code snippet).

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, and `sumInRange` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the condition being satisfied.

Output: **YES (if the condition \(\text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange}\) is satisfied)**
