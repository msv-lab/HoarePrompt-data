Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least three unique characters, `c` is the third character in `b`, `s` is updated by appending the value of `char_map[c]` to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s += char_map[c]` appends the value of `char_map[c]` to the string `s`. The variable `b` remains unchanged, and `c` still represents the third character in `b`. The only change is that `s` now includes the additional characters from `char_map[c]`.
