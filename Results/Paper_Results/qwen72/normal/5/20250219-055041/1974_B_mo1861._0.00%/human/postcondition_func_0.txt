The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced with its mapped character according to a dictionary `char_map`. The `char_map` maps each unique character in `b` to a new character, which is determined by the position of the character in the sorted set of unique characters from `b`. The new character is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted set. The final state of the program is that `s` contains the decoded string based on this mapping.
