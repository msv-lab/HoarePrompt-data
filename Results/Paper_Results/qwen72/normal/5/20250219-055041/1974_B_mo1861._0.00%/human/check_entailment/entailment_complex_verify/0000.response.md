Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process as described in the problem. The issue lies in the creation of the `char_map` dictionary, where the program incorrectly uses the length of the string `b` to determine the mapped characters. Instead, it should use the length of the set of distinct characters in `b` to create the symmetric mapping. 

The provided example `b = "abacaba"` clearly illustrates this issue:
- The distinct characters in `b` are `a`, `b`, and `c`, so the string `r` should be `"abc"`.
- The correct decoding should map `a` to `c`, `b` to `b`, and `c` to `a`, resulting in the string `"cbcbcbc"`.
- However, the original program maps `a` to `g`, `b` to `f`, and `c` to `e`, resulting in the string `"gffgffg"`, which is incorrect.

The corrected version of the function, as suggested in the original assessment, correctly handles the mapping by using the length of the set of distinct characters. This ensures that the mapping is symmetric and respects the alphabetical order of the distinct characters.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
