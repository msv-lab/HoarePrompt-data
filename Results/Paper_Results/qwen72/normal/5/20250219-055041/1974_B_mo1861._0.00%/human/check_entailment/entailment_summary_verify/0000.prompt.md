You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced with its mapped character according to a dictionary `char_map`. The `char_map` maps each unique character in `b` to a new character, which is determined by the position of the character in the sorted set of unique characters from `b`. The new character is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted set. The final state of the program is that `s` contains the decoded string based on this mapping.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process as described in the problem. Specifically, the `char_map` is created using the length of the set of characters in `b` (i.e., the number of distinct characters), but the program incorrectly uses the length of `b` to map the characters. This will lead to incorrect decoding when the length of the set of characters is less than the length of `b`.

For example, consider the input `b = "abacaba"`. The distinct characters in `b` are `a`, `b`, and `c`, so the string `r` should be `"abc"`. The correct decoding should map `a` to `c`, `b` to `b`, and `c` to `a`, resulting in the string `"cbcbcbc"`. However, the program will incorrectly map `a` to `g`, `b` to `f`, and `c` to `e`, resulting in the string `"gffgffg"`, which is not the correct decoding.

To fix this, the `char_map` should be created using the length of the set of characters, not the length of the string `b`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    for i, c in enumerate(distinct_chars):
        char_map[c] = distinct_chars[len(distinct_chars) - i - 1]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```
