The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `b`. `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is mapped to a corresponding character according to `char_map`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `b` and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced with its mapped character according to `char_map`.**
