Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `s` is a string that contains the mapped characters for each character in `b` according to `char_map`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the string `s` will contain the characters from `b` transformed according to the `char_map` dictionary. Each character in `b` will be replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`, and these values will be concatenated in the same order as the characters in `b`. The string `b` and the dictionary `char_map` will remain unchanged.
