The function `func` is expected to take two parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the path, and a string `path` of length `n` consisting of '.', '@', and '*' characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell of the path is guaranteed to be empty.
