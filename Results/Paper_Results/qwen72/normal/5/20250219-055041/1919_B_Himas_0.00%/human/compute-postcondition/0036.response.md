The only objects in the loop head are the variables `q` and `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `e`. If `e` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `e` must have at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character of `e`, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must have at least 3 characters, and `q` will be the third character of `e`.

State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an input integer greater than 0, `e` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character of `e`. If `q` is `+`, then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
