To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop iterator, and it will start at 0 by default.
2. **Result of `int(input())`**: This determines the number of times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and a string `s` of length `n` where `s` consists only of characters "+" and "-".

However, the loop head only involves `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The parameters `t` and the list of tuples are not directly part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect this condition.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
