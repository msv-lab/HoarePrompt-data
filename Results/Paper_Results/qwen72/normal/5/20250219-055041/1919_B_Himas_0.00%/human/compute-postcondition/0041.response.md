Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `e` is a new input string.
   - `P` is the number of `+` characters in `e`.
   - `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not `+`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(P - M)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `P` is the count of `+` characters in the string `e`.
   - `M` is the count of all characters in `e` that are not `+`.
   - The `print` statement will output the result of `P - M`.

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - The total number of characters in `e` is the sum of `P` and `M` (since every character is either a `+` or not a `+`).
   - Therefore, `P + M` is the length of the string `e`.
   - The expression `P - M` can be rewritten as `P - (len(e) - P)`, which simplifies to `2 * P - len(e)`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the value of `2 * P - len(e)`, where `P` is the number of `+` characters in `e` and `len(e)` is the total length of the string `e`.

Output: **2 * P - len(e) (where P is the number of `+` characters in the string `e` and len(e) is the total length of the string `e`)**
