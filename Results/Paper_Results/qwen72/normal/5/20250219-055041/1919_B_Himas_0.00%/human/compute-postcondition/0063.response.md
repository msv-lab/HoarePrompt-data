Output State: **`i` is `t-1`, `s` is an input integer greater than 0, `e` is a new input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the loop counter `i` will be `t-1` (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration). The variables `s` and `e` will hold the values of the last input provided for the `t`-th test case, where `s` is an integer greater than 0 and `e` is a string of length `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. The variable `P` will be the count of '+' characters in the string `e`, and `M` will be the count of '-' characters in the string `e`. The loop will have printed the result of `P - M` for each of the `t` test cases.
