The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can consider as the loop's upper bound. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than this upper bound. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and the loop's upper bound is `s`, which is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `s` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an input integer greater than 1, `e` is a new input string, `P` is the number of `+` characters in `e`, `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not `+`**
