Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays. However, the program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and prints this difference. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which is the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.

For example, in the third test case where `s = "+-+-+-"`, the optimal way to split the array is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `0` because the sum of each subarray is `0` and `0 * 4 + 0 * 2 = 0`. However, the program will output `0` because it calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `3 - 3 = 0`. This is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
