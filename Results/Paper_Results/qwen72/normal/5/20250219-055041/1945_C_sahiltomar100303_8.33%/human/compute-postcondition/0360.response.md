Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and greater than `n // 2 + 3`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 3`, `leftZero` is 1 if the character at index `right - 1` in `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `leftOne` is 1 if the character at index `right - 1` in `s` is '1' and 0 otherwise, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in `s` minus 1 if the character at index `right - 1` in `s` is '0' and the number of '0's in `s` otherwise, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in `s` minus 1 if the character at index `right - 1` in `s` is '1' and the number of '1's in `s` otherwise, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - n // 2 + 1) // 2`, and either `leftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must be true, `tleftZero` is 1 more than its previous value.**
