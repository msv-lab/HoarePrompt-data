Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in `s`.**

The value of `right` is updated to `mid`, which is `n // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
