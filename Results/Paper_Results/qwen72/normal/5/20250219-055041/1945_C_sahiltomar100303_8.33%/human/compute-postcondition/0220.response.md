Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid`. If the character at index `right` in the string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the string `s` minus 1, `leftZero` is 1, and `leftOne` is 0. Otherwise, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the string `s` minus 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the string `s`, `leftZero` is 0, and `leftOne` is 1.**
