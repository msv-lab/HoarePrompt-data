Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n // 2`. If the character at index `right` in `s` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, `trightZero` is decremented by 1, and the values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged. If the character at index `right` in `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is incremented by 1, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, and `trightOne` is decremented by 1, while the values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged. In both cases, `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are less than `(n // 4)` or `(n + 1) // 4`.***
