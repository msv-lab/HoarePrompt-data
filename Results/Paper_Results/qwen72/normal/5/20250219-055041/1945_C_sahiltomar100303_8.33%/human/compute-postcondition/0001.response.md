The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will be incremented from 0 to `t-1` as the loop runs.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `func` and the inputs `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
