Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `left - 1` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s` and must be less than `(left + 1) // 2` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s` and is now `leftOne - 1`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` and is now `rightZero + 1` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2, `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
