Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the second half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `left > 0` and the conditions `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` are true.
- Each iteration of the loop moves one character from the first half of the string `s` to the second half, updating the counts of '0' and '1' characters accordingly.
- The loop will stop when `left` reaches 0, meaning all characters from the first half have been moved to the second half.
- As a result, `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be equal to the number of '0' and '1' characters in the second half of the string, respectively.
- Similarly, `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be equal to the number of '0' and '1' characters in the first half of the string, respectively.
- The variables `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` will also reflect these final counts.
