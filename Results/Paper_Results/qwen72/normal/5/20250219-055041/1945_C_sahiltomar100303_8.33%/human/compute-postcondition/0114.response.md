Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `s` is an input string.
- `right` is initialized to `n`.

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of `right`.

Since `right` is initialized to `n` and there are no operations or conditions that modify `right` before the `print` statement, the value of `right` remains `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **n (where n is the input integer greater than 0)**
