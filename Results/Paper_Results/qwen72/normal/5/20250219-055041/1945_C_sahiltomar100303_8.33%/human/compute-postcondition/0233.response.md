Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `leftZero` is 0 or 1, `leftOne` is 1 or 0, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the string `s` or the number of '0's in the string `s` minus 1, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the string `s` or the number of '1's in the string `s` minus 1, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `trightOne` is decremented by 1, so its value changes from 1 to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
