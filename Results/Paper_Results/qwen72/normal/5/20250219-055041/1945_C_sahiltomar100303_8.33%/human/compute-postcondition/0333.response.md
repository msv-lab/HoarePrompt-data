Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is `left - 1`, `right` is the new `n` if `right == n`, otherwise `right` is not equal to the new `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s` and must be less than `(left + 1) // 2 - 1` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid - 1` characters of `s` and is now `leftOne - 1` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` and is now `rightZero + 1` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2, `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `left` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The specific conditions for `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` are still valid based on the updated value of `left`.
