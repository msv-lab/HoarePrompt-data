Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
The loop continues to increment `idx` by 1 as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(2^{\text{idx}}\). After the loop completes, `idx` will be the smallest integer for which \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\). This means that `idx` will be the position in the list `nums` where the value \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is just greater than `k`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `_`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
