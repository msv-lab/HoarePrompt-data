The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the input range. To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on these objects.

1. The variable `_` is used as a counter in the loop. After the previous iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
2. The loop condition is based on the input range, which is `int(input())`. This value is determined by user input and does not change during the loop execution. Therefore, `n` and `k` are not directly relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the increment of `_` and the unchanged input range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1\), `nums` now includes an additional element at the end which is `k - nums[idx]`, another additional element at the end which is `k + 1`, and a third additional element at the end which is `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) has been removed from `nums`.**
