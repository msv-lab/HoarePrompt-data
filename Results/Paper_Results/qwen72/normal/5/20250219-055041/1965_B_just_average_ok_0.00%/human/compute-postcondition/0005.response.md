Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, `idx` is 1.** 

The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
