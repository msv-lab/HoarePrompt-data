Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, `idx` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `idx` to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the additional information that `idx` is now 0.
