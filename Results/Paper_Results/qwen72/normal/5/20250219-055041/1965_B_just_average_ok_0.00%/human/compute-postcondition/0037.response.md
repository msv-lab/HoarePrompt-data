The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are input integers greater than 0, and the values of `t`, `_`, `nums`, and `idx` are already defined. The code does not change the values of `t`, `_`, `nums`, or `idx`, but it updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1\), `nums` now includes an additional element at the end which is `k - nums[idx]`, another additional element at the end which is `k + 1`, and a third additional element at the end which is `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) has been removed from `nums`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0.**
