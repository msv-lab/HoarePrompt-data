Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx} + 1} > k\), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, and `nums` now includes an additional element `k - nums[idx]` at the end.**
