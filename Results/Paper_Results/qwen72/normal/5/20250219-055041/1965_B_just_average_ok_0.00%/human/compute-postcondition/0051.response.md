Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx} + 1} > k\), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `nums` now includes an additional element `k - nums[idx]` and another additional element `k + 1` at the end, and `nums` has one more additional element `k + nums[idx] + 1` at the end.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- The value of `_` remains 2.
- The element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from the list `nums`.
- The list `nums` still contains all the elements \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, except \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
- The last element of `nums` is still \(2^{23}\).
- The value of `idx` remains the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx} + 1} > k\).
- The value of `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- The value of `k` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- The list `nums` still includes the additional elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` at the end.
