Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `idx` will be the smallest integer for which \( k \) is less than \( 2^{\text{idx}} \). All other variables (`t`, `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states, and `nums` remains the same list of powers of 2.
