Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0.** 

The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, which are integers and must be greater than 0. The initial state of `t` and `_` remains unchanged.
