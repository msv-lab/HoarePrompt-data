Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
    idx = 0
    while k >= 1 << idx:
        idx += 1
    idx -= 1
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, except the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) has been removed, and the last element of `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1\), `nums` now includes an additional element at the end which is `k - nums[idx]`, another additional element at the end which is `k + 1`, and a third additional element at the end which is `k + nums[idx] + 1`, but the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) has been removed from `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx} + 1} > k\), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `nums` now includes an additional element `k - nums[idx]` and another additional element `k + 1` at the end, and `nums` has one more additional element `k + nums[idx] + 1` at the end.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
