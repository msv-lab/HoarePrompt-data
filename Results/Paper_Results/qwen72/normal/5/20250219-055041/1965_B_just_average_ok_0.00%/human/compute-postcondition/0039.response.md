Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0.**

The code snippet sets `idx` to 0, overriding its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `_`, `nums`, `n`, and `k` are still valid.
