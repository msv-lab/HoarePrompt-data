The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 1, and `k` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to \(1 << 1\), which is 2. Therefore, `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to proceed.

Additionally, `idx` must be incremented to 2 for the next iteration to check the next condition, `k >= 1 << 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, and the last element of `nums` is \(2^{23}\), `idx` is 2**
