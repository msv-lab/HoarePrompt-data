Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, except the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) has been removed, and the last element of `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 1, and `nums` is a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) in the range 0 to 23, except one element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) has been removed, and the last element of `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively.
- After executing this code, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, both of which are greater than 0.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `nums`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
- The last element of `nums` is still `k + nums[idx] + 1`, where `k` is now the new input value.
- Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k` while keeping the rest of the initial state unchanged.
