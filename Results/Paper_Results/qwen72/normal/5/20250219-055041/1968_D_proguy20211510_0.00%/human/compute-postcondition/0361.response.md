Output State: **`i` is `len(s) - 1`, `b` and `s` each have `len(s)` elements, `preb` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `b` up to that index, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(s) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `s`.
- **`b` and `s`**: Both `b` and `s` will have the same number of elements as they did initially, which is `len(s)`.
- **`preb`**: This list will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `b` up to each index. For example, the first element will be `b[0]`, the second element will be `b[0] + b[1]`, and so on.
- **`pres`**: This list will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `s` up to each index. For example, the first element will be `s[0]`, the second element will be `s[0] + s[1]`, and so on.
- **`sb`**: This variable will hold the sum of all elements in the list `b`.
- **`ss`**: This variable will hold the sum of all elements in the list `s`.
