Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is true, if `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `k * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. The current value of `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**

The variable `foundb` is now set to true, while the values of `i`, `k`, and the condition related to `founds` and `s` remain unchanged. The current value of `a[pb - 1]` is still equal to `maxa`.
