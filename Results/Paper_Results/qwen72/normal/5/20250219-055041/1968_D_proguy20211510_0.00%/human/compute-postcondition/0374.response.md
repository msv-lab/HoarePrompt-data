Output State: **`i` is 2, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is a list with three elements where the first element is `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`, the second element is `preb[1] + rem * b[1]`, and the third element is `preb[2] + rem * b[2]`, `ptss` is a list with three elements where the first element is `pres[0] + rem * s[0]`, the second element is `pres[1] + rem * s[1]`, and the third element is `pres[2] + rem * s[2]`, `rem` is `k - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])` appends a new element to the list `ptss`.
- The new element is `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, where `i` is 2.
- Therefore, the third element of `ptss` is `pres[2] + rem * s[2]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
