Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `preb` is a list containing the values `sb + b[i]`, `sb + b[k]`, and `sb + b[i]` (the last value is appended), `pres` is a list containing the values `ss + s[i]`, `ss + s[i]`, and `ss + s[i]` (the last value is appended), `sb` is `b[i] + b[i] + b[i]`, `ss` is `s[i] + s[i]`, `s` must have a length greater than `k + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pres.append(ss + s[i])` appends the value `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`.
- The initial state specifies that `pres` already contains the values `ss + s[i]` and `ss + s[i]`.
- After appending, `pres` now contains the values `ss + s[i]`, `ss + s[i]`, and `ss + s[i]`.
- The values of `i`, `k`, `foundb`, `founds`, `preb`, `sb`, and `ss` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `s` must have a length greater than `k + 1` is still valid.
