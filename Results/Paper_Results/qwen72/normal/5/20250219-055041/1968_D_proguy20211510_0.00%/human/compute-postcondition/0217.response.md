Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `b` and `s` each contain `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` as their last element. If `foundb` is true but `founds` is false, `b` contains `maxa` as its last element. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to true, and `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` as its last element. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` as its last element, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is false and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to true, and `s` contains `a[ps - 1]` as its last element. If `founds` is false and `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `s` contains `a[ps - 1]` as its last element, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `k` iterations, the variable `i` will be `k-1`. The lists `b` and `s` will have elements appended based on the conditions within the loop. If both `foundb` and `founds` are true, the last element in both `b` and `s` will be `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If only `foundb` is true, the last element in `b` will be `maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, `foundb` will be set to true, and `b` will have `a[pb - 1]` appended. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, `b` will have `a[pb - 1]` appended, and `pb` will be updated to `p[pb - 1]`. Similarly, if `founds` is false and `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, `founds` will be set to true, and `s` will have `a[ps - 1]` appended. If `founds` is false and `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, `s` will have `a[ps - 1]` appended, and `ps` will be updated to `p[ps - 1]`. The variables `k`, `maxa`, `n`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `maxs`, `maxb`, and `ptsb` will retain their values as determined by the loop conditions and updates.
