Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `s` includes the value `a[ps - 1]` in addition to its previous values, and the state of `b` and `pb` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `s.append(a[ps - 1])` adds the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`.
- The values of `i`, `k`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged.
- The list `b` and the variable `pb` are not affected by this code snippet.
- The list `s` now includes the value `a[ps - 1]` in addition to its previous values, which could be `(k - 2) * maxa` based on the initial conditions.
