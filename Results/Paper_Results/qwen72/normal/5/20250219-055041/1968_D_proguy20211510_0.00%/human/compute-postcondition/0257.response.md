The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is a simple command that prints the string `'Draw'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and lists involved, but none of these variables or lists are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same string regardless of the values of `i`, `pres`, `rem`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb`.

### Output:
Output: **Draw**
