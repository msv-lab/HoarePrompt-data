Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the output is either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the maximum cumulative scores `maxb` and `maxs` calculated for Bodya and Sasha, respectively. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are reset and recalculated for each test case.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input.
- For each test case, the loop reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and the lists `p` and `a`.
- The loop then calculates the maximum value in the list `a` and determines the initial positions of Bodya and Sasha.
- Depending on the initial positions and the maximum value in `a`, the loop may print 'Draw', 'Bodya', or 'Sasha' and continue to the next test case if the conditions are met.
- If the conditions are not met, the loop simulates the game for `k` iterations, tracking the scores of Bodya and Sasha in the lists `b` and `s`.
- The cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha are stored in `preb` and `pres`, respectively.
- The final scores for Bodya and Sasha are calculated and stored in `ptsb` and `ptss`, respectively, taking into account the remaining iterations.
- The maximum values in `ptsb` and `ptss` are compared, and the loop prints 'Bodya' if `maxb` is greater, 'Sasha' if `maxs` is greater, and 'Draw' if they are equal.
- After each test case, the variables used within the loop are reset, and the loop moves on to the next test case.
- Once all `t` test cases have been processed, the loop terminates, and the final output state includes the results of all test cases.
