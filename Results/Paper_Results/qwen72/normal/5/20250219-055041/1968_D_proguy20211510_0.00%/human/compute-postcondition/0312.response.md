Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `foundb` is True, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, if `founds` is True, `b` and `s` each have a new element appended, which is equal to `(k - 2) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `k` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `foundb` remains True.
- The list `b` has a new element appended, which is `a[pb - 1]`.
- If `founds` is True, both `b` and `s` have a new element appended, which is `(k - 2) * maxa`.
- The most internal loop or if statement is exited if `founds` is True.
