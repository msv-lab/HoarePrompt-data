You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, along with two lists `p` and `a`. The function determines the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha based on the maximum values in the array `a` and the permutations in `p`. The game is played for `k` moves, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are given by `P_B` and `P_S`, respectively. The function prints 'Bodya' if Bodya has the higher cumulative score, 'Sasha' if Sasha has the higher cumulative score, and 'Draw' if their scores are equal. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation. Instead, the program assumes that the players will always move to the position specified by the permutation if they have not yet found the maximum value in the array `a`.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation of the Case:**
- **Initial Positions:**
  - Bodya starts at position 3.
  - Sasha starts at position 2.
- **First Turn:**
  - Bodya's score increases by `a[3-1] = 5`.
  - Bodya can stay at position 3 or move to `p[3-1] = 2`.
  - Sasha's score increases by `a[2-1] = 2`.
  - Sasha can stay at position 2 or move to `p[2-1] = 1`.
- **Second Turn:**
  - If Bodya stays at position 3, his score increases by `a[3-1] = 5` again, making his total score 10.
  - If Sasha stays at position 2, his score increases by `a[2-1] = 2` again, making his total score 4.
  - If Sasha moves to position 1, his score increases by `a[1-1] = 7`, making his total score 9.

In this case, Bodya can achieve a score of 10 by staying at position 3, while Sasha can achieve a score of 9 by moving to position 1. Therefore, Bodya wins the game. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" because it does not consider the possibility of staying at the current position.
