Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is `b[i]`, `ss` is 0, `s` must be a non-empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sb` is updated by adding `b[i]` to it. Since `sb` was initially 0, the new value of `sb` is `b[i]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
