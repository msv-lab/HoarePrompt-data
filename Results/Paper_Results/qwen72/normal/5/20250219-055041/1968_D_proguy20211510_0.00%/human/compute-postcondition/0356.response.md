The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `s`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `s`. If `i` is less than the length of `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k`, and `s` has `k + 1` elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `s` must have at least `k + 2` elements.

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `b` and `s` each have `k + 2` elements where `k` is greater than 0, `preb` is a list with two elements `[b[k - 1], b[k - 1] + b[k]]`, `pres` is a list with two elements `[s[k - 1], s[k - 1] + s[k]]`, `sb` is `b[k - 1] + b[k]`, `ss` is `s[k - 1] + s[k]`**
