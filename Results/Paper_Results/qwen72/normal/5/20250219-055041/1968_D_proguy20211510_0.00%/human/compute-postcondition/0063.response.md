Postcondition: **`_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than the new value of `i`, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `s` contains one or two elements. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is True, `founds` is unknown, `i` is incremented by 1, and the list `b` now includes the element `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `s` contains one or two elements plus the new element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is updated to `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the list `b` now includes the element `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `s` contains one or two elements plus the new element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
