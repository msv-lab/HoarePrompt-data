Output State: **`i` is 1, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is a list with one element equal to `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`, `ptss` is a list with one element equal to `pres[0] + rem * s[0]`, `rem` is `k - 2`**

Explanation: The value of `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 2` since `i` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
