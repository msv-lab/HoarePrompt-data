The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into multiple strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**
