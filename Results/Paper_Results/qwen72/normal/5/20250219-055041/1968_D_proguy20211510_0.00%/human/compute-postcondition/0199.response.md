Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `b` is a list that includes the value `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `founds` is true, `s` is a list that includes the value `maxa`. If `foundb` is true and both `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` is a list that includes the values `(k - 1) * maxa`, `maxa`, and `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is true but `founds` is false, `b` is a list that includes the value `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is true, `b` is a list that includes the values `(k - 1) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is false, `b` is a list that includes the values `a[pb - 1]` and `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and both `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` is a list that includes the values `(k - 1) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and either `foundb` or `founds` is false, `b` is a list that includes the values `a[pb - 1]` and `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is false and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `founds` is false, `s` has a new element appended which is `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.**
