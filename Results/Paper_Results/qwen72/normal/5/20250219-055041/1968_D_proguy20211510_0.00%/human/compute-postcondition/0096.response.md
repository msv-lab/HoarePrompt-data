Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `preb` is a list that now contains one more element, which is the value of `sb` plus the first element of `s`, `sb` is updated to `sb + b[0]`.**

The value of `i` remains 0, and `s` is still a list of integers with at least one element. The list `preb` now contains one additional element, which is the sum of the initial value of `sb` and the first element of `s`. The value of `sb` is updated by adding the first element of `b` to it.
