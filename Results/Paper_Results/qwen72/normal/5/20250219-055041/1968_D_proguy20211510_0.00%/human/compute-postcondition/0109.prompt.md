Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` and `s` are lists of integers, `founds` and `foundb` are booleans, `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    preb.append(sb + b[i])
    sb += b[i]
    pres.append(ss + s[i])
    ss += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `preb` is a list that now contains one more element, which is the value of `sb` plus the first element of `s`, `sb` is updated to `sb + s[0]`, `pres` is a list that now contains one more element, which is the value of `ss` plus the first element of `s`, `ss` is updated to `ss + s[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `preb` is a list that now contains two more elements, the first being `sb + s[0]` and the second being `sb + s[1]`, `sb` is updated to `sb + s[0] + s[1]`, `pres` is a list that now contains two more elements, the first being `ss + s[0]` and the second being `ss + s[0] + s[1]`, `ss` is updated to `ss + s[0] + s[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `preb` is a list that now contains three more elements, the first being `sb + s[0]`, the second being `sb + s[1]`, and the third being `sb + s[2]`, `sb` is updated to `sb + s[0] + s[1] + s[2]`, `pres` is a list that now contains three more elements, the first being `ss + s[0]`, the second being `ss + s[0] + s[1]`, and the third being `ss + s[0] + s[1] + s[2]`, `ss` is updated to `ss + s[0] + s[1] + s[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
