Output State: **`i` is 1, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is a list with two elements where the first element is `preb[0] + rem * b[0]` and the second element is `preb[1] + rem * b[1]`, `ptss` is a list with two elements where the first element is `pres[0] + rem * s[0]` and the second element is `pres[1] + rem * s[1]`, `rem` is `k - 2`**. 

The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`, which is the value of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` where `i` is 1. Therefore, the second element of `ptss` is now `pres[1] + rem * s[1]`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
