Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `foundb` and `founds` can be either True or False, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `(k - 3) * maxa`, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `(k - 3) * maxa`.**

The code snippet `s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)` appends a new element to the list `s`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `(k - (i + 1))` simplifies to `(k - 3)`. Therefore, the new element appended to `s` is `(k - 3) * maxa`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
