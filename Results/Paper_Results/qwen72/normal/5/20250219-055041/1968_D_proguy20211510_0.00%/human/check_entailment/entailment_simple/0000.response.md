### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if both players start at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - It checks if Bodya starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Bodya" and continues to the next test case.
   - It checks if Sasha starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Sasha" and continues to the next test case.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It keeps track of the positions and scores of both players.
   - If a player reaches a position with the maximum value in `a`, the program sets a flag (`foundb` or `founds`) to indicate that the player will stay at that position for the remaining turns.
   - The scores are updated based on the current position and the decision to stay or move.

4. **Cumulative Scores:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for both players after each turn.
   - It then calculates the potential scores for the remaining turns if a player has found the maximum value in `a`.

5. **Final Comparison:**
   - The program compares the maximum potential scores of both players.
   - It prints "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Variable Initialization:**
  - The variables `YES` and `NO` are defined but never used, which is unnecessary.
  - The variable `alpha` is defined but never used, which is also unnecessary.

- **Potential Infinite Loop:**
  - The program does not handle the case where a player gets stuck in a cycle within the permutation. This could lead to incorrect results if the cycle is not detected and the player continues to move without reaching the maximum value in `a`.

- **Redundant Calculations:**
  - The program calculates the potential scores for the remaining turns multiple times, which is redundant and inefficient.

### Correctness:
- **False:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where a player gets stuck in a cycle within the permutation. This can lead to incorrect results because the player might not reach the maximum value in `a` within the given number of turns.
  - The program's logic for calculating the potential scores for the remaining turns is flawed and can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
