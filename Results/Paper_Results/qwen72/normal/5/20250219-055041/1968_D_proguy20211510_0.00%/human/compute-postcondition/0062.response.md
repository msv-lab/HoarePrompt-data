Output State: **`_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than the new value of `i`, `pb` is now equal to `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`, `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `s` contains one or two elements. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `s` contains one or two elements plus the new element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The list `b` now includes the element `a[pb - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
- The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `s` and `i` remains the same.
- The list `b` still includes the element `a[pb - 1]` after the update.
