Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0.**

The value of `j` is explicitly set to 0, and the states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, `i`, `l`) remain unchanged.
