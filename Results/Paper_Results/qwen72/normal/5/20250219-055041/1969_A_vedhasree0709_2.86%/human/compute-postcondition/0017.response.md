Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 3, `j` remains 0.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The conditions for `j` to be set to 1 (i.e., `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`) have not been checked again, so `j` remains 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
