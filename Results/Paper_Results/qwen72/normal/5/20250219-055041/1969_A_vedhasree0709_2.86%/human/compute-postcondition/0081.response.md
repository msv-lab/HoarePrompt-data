Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If any element `l[k]` is `k + 2` and the next element `l[k + 1]` is `k + 1` for any `k` in the range 0 to `n-1`, then `j` is 1 and the program has broken out of the loop. Otherwise, `j` remains 0. The current value of `j` is 0.**
