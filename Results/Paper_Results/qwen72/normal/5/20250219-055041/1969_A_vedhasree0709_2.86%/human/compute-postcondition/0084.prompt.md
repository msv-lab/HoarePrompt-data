Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of n, an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the number of friends, and a list p of n integers where 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct, representing the best friends of each friend.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i <= n - 1:
        if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
            print(2)
            j = 1
            break
        i += 1
    if j == 0:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is `n`, and `j` is 0 if there does not exist an index `i` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` in the list `l`. Otherwise, `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `j` is 0, it means no element `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and the next element `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1` for any `k` in the range 0 to `n-2`. Otherwise, `j` is 1, indicating that such a pair of elements exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If any element `l[k]` is `k + 2` and the next element `l[k + 1]` is `k + 1` for any `k` in the range 0 to `n-1`, then `j` is 1 and the program has broken out of the loop. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
