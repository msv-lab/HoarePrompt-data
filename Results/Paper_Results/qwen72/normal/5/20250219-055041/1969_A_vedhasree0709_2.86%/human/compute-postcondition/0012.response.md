The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `i <= n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented, and `n` must be greater than 1.

Since `i` is 1, incrementing `i` to 2 will allow the loop to continue if `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2, and `n` must remain greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
