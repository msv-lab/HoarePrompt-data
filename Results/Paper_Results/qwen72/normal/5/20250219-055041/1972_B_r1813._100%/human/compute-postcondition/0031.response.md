The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "U" and "D", representing the state of the coins.

The function returns a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the number of coins that need to be flipped to make all coins face "U" (up) for each test case.
