Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `index` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `s` is the value of `data[4]`, and `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. If `count_u` is odd, the current value of `count_u` remains odd. If `count_u` is even, the current value of `count_u` remains even.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `data[index + 1]`, which is `data[4]` since `index` is 3.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `index`, `n`, and `count_u` remain unchanged.
- The condition regarding `count_u` (whether it is odd or even) remains valid as it is dependent on the new value of `s`.
