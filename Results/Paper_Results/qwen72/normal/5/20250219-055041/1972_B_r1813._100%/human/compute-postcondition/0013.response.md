Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `index` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is the value of `data[2]`, and `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. If `count_u` is odd, the current value of `count_u` remains odd. If `count_u` is even, the current value of `count_u` remains even.***
