The function `func_1` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "U" and "D". It then checks if the number of "U" characters in `s` is odd. If the count is odd, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variable `t` retaining its initial value, `_` being `t-1`, `index` being `1 + 2 * t`, `n` being the last processed integer, `s` being the last processed string, and `count_u` being the count of "U" characters in the last processed string.
