Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign will occur, following the rules that each sign must occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of signs and their periodicities. It initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the starting year from which the tribe waits for the signs to occur.

The key part of the program is the loop where it calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of the current sign's periodicity and is strictly greater than the last calculated year. This is done using the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This expression works as follows:
- `start_year // nums[x]` finds the largest integer multiple of `nums[x]` that is less than or equal to `start_year`.
- Adding 1 to this quotient gives the next integer multiple of `nums[x]`.
- Multiplying this result by `nums[x]` gives the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

This logic ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, and the final value of `start_year` after the loop is the year when the n-th sign will occur.

The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for the given example. Therefore, the program is correct.
