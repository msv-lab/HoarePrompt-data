Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `start_year` is 0.
- The expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` calculates the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
- Since `start_year` is 0, the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0 is `nums[0]` itself.
- Therefore, `start_year` is updated to `nums[0]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num_tests`, `nums`, `x`) remain unchanged.
