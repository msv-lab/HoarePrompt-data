Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 0**

Explanation:
- `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0. Since `start_year` was initially 0, the new value of `start_year` is simply `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` is greater than 0, otherwise, it remains 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num_tests`, `nums`, `x`) remain unchanged.
