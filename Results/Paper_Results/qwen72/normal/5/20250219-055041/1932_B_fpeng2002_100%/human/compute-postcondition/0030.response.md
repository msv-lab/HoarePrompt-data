The code snippet `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]` reads a space-separated string of integers from the user input and converts it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `nums`.

- The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `len(nums)` elements. After the code execution, `nums` will contain the new list of integers provided by the user.
- The initial state also specifies that `x` is `len(nums) - 1`. Since `nums` is updated with a new list, `x` will be recalculated as `len(nums) - 1` based on the new `nums`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num_tests`, `start_year`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the product of all elements in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the initial `start_year`, `nums` is a new list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**
