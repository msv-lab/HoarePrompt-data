Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The key is to calculate the smallest year that is a multiple of each sign's periodicity, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.

The program uses a loop to process each test case. For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0. Then, for each sign's periodicity in `nums`, it updates `start_year` to the smallest multiple of the current periodicity that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`. This is achieved by the line:
```python
start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```
This line ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.

Let's break down the logic for the example provided:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Signs: 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18
   - Initial `start_year` = 0
   - After the first sign (3): `start_year` = 3
   - After the second sign (2): `start_year` = 4
   - After the third sign (4): `start_year` = 8
   - After the fourth sign (5): `start_year` = 10
   - After the fifth sign (9): `start_year` = 18
   - After the sixth sign (18): `start_year` = 36

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Signs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Initial `start_year` = 0
   - After the first sign (1): `start_year` = 1
   - After the second sign (2): `start_year` = 2
   - After the third sign (3): `start_year` = 3
   - After the fourth sign (4): `start_year` = 4
   - After the fifth sign (5): `start_year` = 5

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Signs: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
   - Initial `start_year` = 0
   - After the first sign (1): `start_year` = 1
   - After the second sign (1): `start_year` = 2
   - After the third sign (1): `start_year` = 3
   - After the fourth sign (1): `start_year` = 4
   - After the fifth sign (1): `start_year` = 5

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Signs: 50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006
   - Initial `start_year` = 0
   - After the first sign (50): `start_year` = 50
   - After the second sign (30): `start_year` = 60
   - After the third sign (711): `start_year` = 711
   - After the fourth sign (200): `start_year` = 800
   - After the fifth sign (503): `start_year` = 1509
   - After the sixth sign (1006): `start_year` = 2012

The program correctly calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of each sign's periodicity, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred. This matches the problem description and the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
