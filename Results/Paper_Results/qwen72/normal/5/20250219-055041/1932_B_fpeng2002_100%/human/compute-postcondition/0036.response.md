The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The list `nums` must still have at least one more element for the loop to continue, meaning `nums` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `x` is 2**
