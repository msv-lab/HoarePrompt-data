Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the original `start_year`, `x` is 2**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` updates the value of `start_year`.
- `x` is 2, so `nums[x]` refers to `nums[2]`.
- The expression `(start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]` calculates the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the original `start_year`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num_tests`, `nums`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
