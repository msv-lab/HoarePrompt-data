Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the signs occur with a periodicity of 1. According to the problem description, if the i-th sign occurs in year x, the tribe starts waiting for the (i+1)-th sign from year x+1. However, the program does not account for this correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
1
3
1 1 1
```

The expected output is 3, as the first sign occurs in year 1, the second sign in year 2, and the third sign in year 3. However, the program will output 1, which is incorrect. This is because the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not increment the year correctly when the periodicity is 1. It should be adjusted to ensure that the start year for the next sign is correctly incremented by 1.
