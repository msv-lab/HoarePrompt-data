The function `func` reads an integer `num_tests` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `nums` of `n` integers. It calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of each integer in `nums` in sequence, starting from 0, and prints this year. After processing all test cases, `num_tests` is 0, and the function does not return any value.
