The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. The other variables `t`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 30, `i` is 0**
