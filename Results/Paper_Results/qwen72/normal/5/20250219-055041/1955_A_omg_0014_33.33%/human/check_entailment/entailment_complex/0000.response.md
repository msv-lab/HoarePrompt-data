Reasoning:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The function reads the number of test cases into the variable `n`, but then it reads the test case values into variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. According to the problem description, the variables should be `n`, `a`, and `b` where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. The variable `c` is not defined in the problem description.

2. **Calculation of `d`**: The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, but this is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `b / 2` to determine the price of one yogurt when buying two at the promotion price.

3. **Condition and Output**: The condition `if a * b < a * d:` is incorrect. It should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`) with the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price as much as possible. The correct logic should involve calculating the minimum cost by considering both the regular price and the promotion price.

4. **Rounding**: The use of `round(a * d)` is not necessary and is incorrect in this context. The cost should be an integer, and the program should not round the result.

5. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable `i` is not used in the program, which is fine, but it's not clear from the code why it is there. It should be clear that the loop is iterating over the test cases.

6. **Input Handling**: The program should read the number of test cases `t` first, and then for each test case, it should read `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):  # Iterate over each test case
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())  # Read n, a, and b for the current test case
        
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price as much as possible
        cost_with_promotion = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price
        cost_without_promotion = n * a
        
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_with_promotion, cost_without_promotion))
```

Explanation of the corrected program:
- **Reading Input**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - `cost_with_promotion` calculates the cost by using the promotion price as much as possible. It buys pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
  - `cost_without_promotion` calculates the cost by buying all yogurts at the regular price.
- **Output**: The program prints the minimum of the two calculated costs for each test case.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
