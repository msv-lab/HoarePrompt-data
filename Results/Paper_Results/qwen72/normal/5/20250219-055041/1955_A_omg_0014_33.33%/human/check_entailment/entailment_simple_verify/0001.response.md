### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `n`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Variable Assignment:**
   - The program assigns `d` as `c / 2`. This is intended to represent the cost of one yogurt if bought under the promotion (since the promotion price is for two yogurts).

3. **Cost Comparison:**
   - The program then compares `a * b` with `a * d`:
     - `a * b` is the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `a * d` is the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price (if `d` is the cost of one yogurt under the promotion).

4. **Output:**
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

### Issues:
1. **Variable Misnaming:**
   - The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are misnamed. According to the problem description, `n` should be the number of yogurts, `a` should be the price of one yogurt, and `b` should be the promotion price for two yogurts. However, in the program, `a` is used as the number of yogurts, `b` is used as the price of one yogurt, and `c` is used as the promotion price for two yogurts.
   - This misnaming leads to incorrect logic in the cost comparison.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is the correct way to find the cost of one yogurt under the promotion.
   - However, the comparison `a * b < a * d` is incorrect because `a` should be the number of yogurts, not the price of one yogurt.
   - The correct comparison should be between the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price and the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the promotion price.

3. **Rounding Issue:**
   - The program uses `round(a * d)`, which is not necessary. The cost should be an integer, and the correct approach is to use the minimum of the two calculated costs.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price
        regular_cost = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price
        promotion_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(regular_cost, promotion_cost))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Regular Cost Calculation:**
  - `regular_cost = n * a` calculates the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
- **Promotion Cost Calculation:**
  - `(n // 2) * b` calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
  - `(n % 2) * a` calculates the cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price (if `n` is odd, there will be one yogurt left).
- **Minimum Cost:**
  - `print(min(regular_cost, promotion_cost))` prints the minimum of the two calculated costs.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to variable misnaming and incorrect cost comparison logic. The corrected program addresses these issues and correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts.

Final: **False**
