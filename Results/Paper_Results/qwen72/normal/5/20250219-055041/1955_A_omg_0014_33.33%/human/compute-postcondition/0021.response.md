Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and for each iteration `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, c <= 30. `d` is equal to `c / 2` for each iteration. For each iteration, if `a * b` is less than `a * d`, the condition `a * b < a * d` holds true and `a * b` is printed. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d` and `round(a * d)` is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- The variable `n` is an integer that is at least 1, indicating the number of iterations the loop has completed.
- The loop index `i` is equal to `n - 1`, meaning the loop has run `n` times.
- For each iteration, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range 1 to 30, and `d` is calculated as `c / 2`.
- During each iteration, the loop checks if `a * b` is less than `a * d`. If it is, `a * b` is printed. Otherwise, `round(a * d)` is printed.
