### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping:**
   - The function starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `n` times, where it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. However, the variable names used in the loop are incorrect. The problem description states that `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts. The program uses `a`, `b`, and `c` instead of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Price Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is intended to represent the price of one yogurt when bought in a pair. However, this is incorrect because `c` should be `b` (the price of two yogurts), and `d` should be `b / 2`.

3. **Cost Comparison:**
   - The program then compares `a * b` with `a * d` to determine the minimum cost. This comparison is flawed because:
     - `a * b` should be `a * n` (the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price).
     - `a * d` should be `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` (the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of the comparison, but the logic is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price
        regular_cost = a * n
        
        # Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price
        # and the remaining yogurts at the regular price
        promotion_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(regular_cost, promotion_cost))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Parsing:**
  - `t` is the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read correctly.
- **Cost Calculation:**
  - `regular_cost` is the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price.
  - `promotion_cost` is the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
- **Output:**
  - The minimum of the two costs is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the original program, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
