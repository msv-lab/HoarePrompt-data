The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 30, `c` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `d` is equal to `c / 2`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated from user input. If the new `a * b` is less than the new `a * d`, the condition `a * b < a * d` holds true. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`.**
