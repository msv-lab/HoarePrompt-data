The function `func_1` should actually be defined with parameters `n, a, b, c` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
