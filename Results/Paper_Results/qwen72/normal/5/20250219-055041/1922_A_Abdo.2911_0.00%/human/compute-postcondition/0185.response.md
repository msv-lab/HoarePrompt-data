The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `b`, `template` is a list that contains the first element of `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the first element of `a`.**
