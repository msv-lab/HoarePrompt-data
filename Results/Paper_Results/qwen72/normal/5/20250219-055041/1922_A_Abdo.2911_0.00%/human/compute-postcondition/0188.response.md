Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `template` is a list. If the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `b`, `template` contains the first element of `a` followed by the second element of `a`. If the first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `b`, `template` contains the uppercase version of the first element of `a` followed by the uppercase version of the second element of `a`.***
