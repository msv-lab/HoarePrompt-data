Output State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If any character in `template` is lowercase and the corresponding character in `c` is not equal to `template`, or if any character in `template` is uppercase and the corresponding character in `c` matches when converted to lowercase, `match_c` is `False`. Otherwise, `match_c` remains `True`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` is decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` must be greater than 0.
- The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same as they were after stripping leading and trailing whitespace.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The `template` list remains the same, with each element being the corresponding character from `a` if the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`.
- The variable `match_c` is `False` if any character in `template` is lowercase and the corresponding character in `c` is not equal to `template`, or if any character in `template` is uppercase and the corresponding character in `c` matches when converted to lowercase. Otherwise, `match_c` remains `True`.
