Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`, `match_a_b` is `False` if any of the conditions are met, otherwise `True`, and `match_c` is `True`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
