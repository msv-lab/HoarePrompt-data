Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. `match_a_b` is `False` if any of the following conditions are met for any index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`: (1) `template[i]` is a lowercase letter and `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or (2) `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter and either `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the list), and the variable `match_a_b` will be `False` if any of the elements in `template` do not match the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` according to the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, if `template[i]` is a lowercase letter and either `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is an uppercase letter and either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches the lowercase version of `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` will be set to `False` and the loop will terminate early. If none of these conditions are met for any index `i`, `match_a_b` will remain `True`.
