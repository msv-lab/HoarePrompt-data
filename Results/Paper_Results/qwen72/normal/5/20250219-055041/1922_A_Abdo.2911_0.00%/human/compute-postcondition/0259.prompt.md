Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            template.append(a[i])
        else:
            template.append(a[i].upper())
    match_a_b = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                match_a_b = False
                break
        elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
            ].lower():
            match_a_b = False
            break
    match_c = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if c[i] != template[i]:
                match_c = False
                break
        elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
            match_c = False
            break
    if match_a_b and not match_c:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) for all `n` characters in `a`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains `True` or `False` based on the initial conditions, and `match_c` is `True` if no character in `template` is a lowercase letter that does not match the corresponding character in `c`, or if no character in `template` is not a lowercase letter that matches the corresponding character in `c` in a case-insensitive manner.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding character from `a` if the character at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is executed, and either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
