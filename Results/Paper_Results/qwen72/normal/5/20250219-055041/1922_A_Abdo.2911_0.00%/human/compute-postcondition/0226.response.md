Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`, `match_a_b` is `False` if any of the conditions are met, otherwise `True`, `match_c` is `True`, and the first element of `template` is a lowercase string.**
