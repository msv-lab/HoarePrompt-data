Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `template` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `template` is a list containing the first character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the first character of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 1. `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` (or the uppercase version of the first character of `a` if the first characters of `a` and `b` are not equal). If the second characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `template` also contains the second character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of the second character of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 2, and `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` (or the uppercase version of the first character of `a` if the first characters of `a` and `b` are not equal), the second character of `a` (or the uppercase version of the second character of `a` if the second characters of `a` and `b` are not equal), and the third character of `a` (or the uppercase version of the third character of `a` if the third characters of `a` and `b` are not equal).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
