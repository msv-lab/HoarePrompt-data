Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `template` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `template` is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last index of the range.
- The variable `template` will be a list of length `n`, where each element is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the corresponding character in `b`, or the uppercase version of the corresponding character from `a` if it does not match.
