The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional block it is inside. Since the values of the variables are not altered by the `break` statement itself, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the additional information that the program has exited the most immediate loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is the corresponding element from `a` if it matches the corresponding element in `b`, otherwise it is the uppercase version of the corresponding element from `a`. `match_a_b` is `False`. The program has exited the most immediate loop or conditional block.**
