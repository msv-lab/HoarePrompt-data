The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is `t-1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the latest input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 1. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `template` is a list containing the first character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of the first character of `a`.**
