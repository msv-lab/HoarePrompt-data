To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `j`. The loop iterates over the sorted list `d`, and at the end of each iteration, the next tuple `(i, j)` is taken from `d`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ans` is a string containing the last character of `s` and the character at index `i` of `s`.
- `d` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key and its corresponding value from the dictionary `d`, sorted by the value in ascending order, and `d` must contain at least one tuple.
- `i` is the key of the next tuple in `d`.
- `j` is the value of the next tuple in `d`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple `(i, j)` must be the next element in the list `d`. Since `d` is a sorted list of tuples and must contain at least one tuple, we need to ensure that there is at least one more tuple in `d` for the loop to continue.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be the key of the next tuple in `d`.
- `j` will be the value of the next tuple in `d`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the last character of `s` and the character at index `i` of `s`; `d` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key and its corresponding value from the dictionary `d`, sorted by the value in ascending order, and `d` must contain at least one more tuple; `i` is the key of the next tuple in `d`; `j` is the value of the next tuple in `d`.**
