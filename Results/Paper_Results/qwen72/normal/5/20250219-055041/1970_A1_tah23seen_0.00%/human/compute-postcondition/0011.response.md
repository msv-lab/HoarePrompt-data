Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0`, `d[1]` is set to 1 if `s[0]` is '(', or -1 if `s[0]` is ')', and `d[2]` is `d[1] + 1`; `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the dictionary `d` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `i + 1` (which is 2) and the value is `d[i] + 1` (which is `d[1] + 1`). The value of `d[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of the string `s`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
