Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0`, `d[1]` is set to 1 if `s[0]` is '(', or -1 if `s[0]` is ')', and `d[2]` is `d[1] - 1`; `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1` updates the dictionary `d` at the key `i + 1` (which is 2) to be the value of `d[i]` (which is 1 if `s[0]` is '(', or -1 if `s[0]` is ')') minus 1.
- Therefore, `d[2]` is `d[1] - 1`.
- The values of `s`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
