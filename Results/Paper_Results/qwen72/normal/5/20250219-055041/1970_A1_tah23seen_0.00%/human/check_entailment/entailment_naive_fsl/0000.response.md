Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. Specifically, the program does not break ties in the sorting step in decreasing order of position, which is a crucial part of the balanced shuffle operation. 

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The correct balanced shuffle should be `()(()())` as described in the problem. However, the current implementation of the program will produce `(()())()`, which is incorrect. This is because the program sorts the positions based on the prefix balance but does not ensure that positions with the same prefix balance are sorted in decreasing order.
