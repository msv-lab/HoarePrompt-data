Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Dictionary Initialization and Usage**: The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`, which is correct for the initial balance. However, the dictionary is then used to store the balance at each position, but it should store the balance and the position together in a way that can be sorted.

2. **Sorting and Ties**: The program sorts the dictionary items by balance, but it does not break ties by position in the correct order (decreasing order of position).

3. **Character Extraction**: The program extracts characters from the input string using the sorted positions, but it does not correctly handle the tie-breaking rule for positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        positions.append((balance, -i, s[i]))
    
    positions.sort()
    
    ans = ''.join([char for (bal, pos, char) in positions])
    return ans

n = input().strip()
print(func_1(n))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Balance Calculation**: We calculate the balance for each prefix and store it along with the negative position and the character in a list `positions`. The negative position is used to sort in decreasing order of position when balances are the same.

2. **Sorting**: We sort the list `positions` by balance and then by negative position.

3. **Character Extraction**: We extract the characters from the sorted list and join them to form the final balanced shuffle sequence.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given problem.
