The `print('NO')` statement will print the string 'NO' to the console. The precondition indicates that the variable `no` is currently True, which suggests that the conditions leading to this print statement are such that `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, and no character in `c` was found that is not in the corresponding position of `a` or `b`.

Output: **NO**
