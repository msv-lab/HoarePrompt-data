Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `tests` must be greater than 0
- `slength` is an input integer
- `a` is an input string
- `b` is an input string
- `c` is an input string that must have at least two characters, and `c` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to `b`
- `counter` is 1
- `x` is the second character of `c`
- `no` is False

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it does not use any of them.

Output: **YES**
