Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `tests` must be greater than 0.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `c` is an input string that must have at least one character.
- `no` is False.
- `c` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to `b`.
- `counter` is 0.
- `x` is the first character of `c`.
- The first character of `c` is not in the first character of `a` and not in the first character of `b`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it is a hardcoded string.

Output: **YES**
