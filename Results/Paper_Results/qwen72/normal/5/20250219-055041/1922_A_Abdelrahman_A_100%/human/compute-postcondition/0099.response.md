Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `tests` must be greater than 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, `counter` is the length of `c`. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, `no` is False. Otherwise, `c` must have at least as many characters as the length of `a` and `b`, `counter` is the length of `a` or `b` (whichever is shorter), and `no` is True if all characters in `c` are found in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. The current value of `no` is True.**
