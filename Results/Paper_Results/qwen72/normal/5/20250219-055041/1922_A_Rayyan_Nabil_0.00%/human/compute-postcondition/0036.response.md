The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, and `t` is greater than 0. However, since `i` is being used in the loop and is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we need to consider the next value of `i`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` must be greater than `n`.

State: **`t` is greater than `n`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `c` is a new input string, `l` is 'NO' or 'YES' based on the previous iteration's condition**
