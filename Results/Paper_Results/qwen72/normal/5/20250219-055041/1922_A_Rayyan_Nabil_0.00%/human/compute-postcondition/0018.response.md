Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string.
   - `c` is an input string.
   - If for any index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `c` and the character at index `i` in `b` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.

2. **Logic:**
   - The variable `l` is determined by checking each character in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` at the same index.
   - If for any index `i` (from 0 to `n-1`), both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, then `l` is set to 'YES'.
   - If this condition is not met for any index, then `l` is set to 'NO'.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(l)` statement will output either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition described.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, we can describe the output based on the given condition:

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where 'YES' is printed if for any index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, and 'NO' is printed otherwise)**
