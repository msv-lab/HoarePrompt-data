Output State: **`a` is a list where the first element is 0, and the subsequent elements are integers provided by the input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c` and must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries and is now the second integer from the input, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 2, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` > 1 else `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b[i]` (which is `b[2]` since `i` is 2) is updated to `b[i - 1] + x` (which is `b[1] + x`).
- `b[1]` was previously `b[0] + x`, and since `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is `x`.
- Therefore, `b[2]` becomes `x + x`, which is `2 * x`.
- The value of `x` is determined by the condition `a[2] > 1`. If `a[2]` is greater than 1, `x` is 1; otherwise, `x` is 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
