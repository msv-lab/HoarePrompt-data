The code snippet `n, q = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `q`, both converted to integers.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c` and is now the first integer from the input, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries and is now the second integer from the input, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
