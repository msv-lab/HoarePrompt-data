Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has all elements equal to 1. According to the problem description, a subarray is good if there exists an array `b` such that the sum of elements in `b` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray of `c`, and each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `c` and greater than 0. However, if the subarray consists of all 1s, it is impossible to construct such an array `b` because any positive integer different from 1 will change the sum. The program incorrectly prints "YES" for such cases. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 5
```

The program will output "YES" for the query, which is incorrect. The correct output should be "NO" because there is no way to construct an array `b` that meets all the conditions for this subarray.
