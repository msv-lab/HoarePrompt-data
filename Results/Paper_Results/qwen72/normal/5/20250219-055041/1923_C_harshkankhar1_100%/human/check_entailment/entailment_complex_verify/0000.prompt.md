You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4

    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `a` is a list where the first element is 0, and the subsequent elements are integers provided by the input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c` and must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries and is now the second integer from the input, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` > 1 else `x` is 2, `b[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i-1] + 1` if `a[i]` > 1 else `b[i]` is `b[i-1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `a` is a list of cumulative sums, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (n > 0), `q` is 0, `c` is a list of integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, and either 'NO' or 'YES' has been printed for each query based on the conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array `c`. It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q` from input, followed by the elements of the array `c`. It then constructs a prefix sum array `a` and another prefix sum array `b` based on the elements of `c`. For each query, it reads a pair of indices `(x, y)` and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in `c` from index `x` to `y` is at least the corresponding sum in `b` and `x` is not equal to `y`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input arrays and variables are consumed, and the results of the queries are printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has all elements equal to 1. According to the problem description, a subarray is good if there exists an array `b` such that the sum of elements in `b` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray of `c`, and each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `c` and greater than 0. However, if the subarray consists of all 1s, it is impossible to construct such an array `b` because any positive integer different from 1 will change the sum. The program incorrectly prints "YES" for such cases. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 5
```

The program will output "YES" for the query, which is incorrect. The correct output should be "NO" because there is no way to construct an array `b` that meets all the conditions for this subarray.
