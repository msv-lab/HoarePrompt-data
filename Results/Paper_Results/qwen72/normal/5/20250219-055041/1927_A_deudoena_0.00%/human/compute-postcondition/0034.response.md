Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads a string `inpstr` from user input, which is expected to contain characters 'W' or 'B' and at least one 'B' character. After processing, it prints the difference between the length of the string and the sum of the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string. If 'B' is not found in the string, the function will print the length of the string minus the index of the first occurrence of 'B'. **
