Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` must be a non-empty string, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0. If the current character `j` is 'B', `ind1` is updated to `i`, `ind2` remains 0, `outind` remains 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
