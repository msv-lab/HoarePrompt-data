Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. The logic in the program is to find the first and last occurrences of 'B' and then calculate the length of the segment that needs to be painted. However, this approach fails in cases where the segment between the first and last 'B' does not cover all 'B' cells in the string. 

For example, consider the test case "WBBWBW". The program will find the first 'B' at index 1 and the last 'B' at index 4, and it will output `4 - 1 = 3`, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 4, as you need to paint the segment from index 1 to index 4 to cover all 'B' cells.

A correct approach would be to find the index of the first 'B' and the index of the last 'B' and then calculate the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B' inclusive. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        first_b = s.find('B')
        last_b = s.rfind('B')
        if first_b == -1:  # This should not happen as at least one cell is black
            results.append(0)
        else:
            results.append(last_b - first_b + 1)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This version correctly finds the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to cover all 'B' cells.
