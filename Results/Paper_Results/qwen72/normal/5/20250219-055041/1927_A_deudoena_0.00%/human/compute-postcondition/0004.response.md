The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `j`, and the object `inpstr`. For the loop to execute, `inpstr` must be a non-empty string. The variables `i` and `j` will be initialized by the `enumerate` function as the loop starts, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, the state of `inpstr` must be such that it contains at least one character for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` must be a non-empty string, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0**
