The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a value, the nature of which is not specified.
