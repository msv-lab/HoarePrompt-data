Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` is a string, `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` if 'B' is found, otherwise `ind2` remains 0, `outind` is 0, `i` is the index of the last character in `inpstr` if 'B' is not found, otherwise it is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10, `s` is still a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B'. The variable `inpstr` is unchanged. `ind1` still holds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`. `ind2` will be updated to the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` if a 'B' is found, otherwise it remains 0. `outind` remains 0. The variable `i` will be the index of the last character in `inpstr` if no 'B' is found, otherwise it will be the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
