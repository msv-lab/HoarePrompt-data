The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `low + 1 < high`. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is either 0 or `n // 2`, and `high` is either `n // 2` or `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `low + 1` must be less than `high`.

Given the current state:
- `low` is 0 and `high` is `n // 2` if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`
- `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n` if `arr[mid]` is not greater than `k`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- If `low` is 0 and `high` is `n // 2`, then `0 + 1 < n // 2` must be true, which means `n // 2` must be greater than 1.
- If `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`, then `n // 2 + 1 < n` must be true, which means `n` must be greater than `n // 2 + 1`.

Since `n` must be greater than 1 in both cases, and `n` is already stated to be greater than or equal to its initial value and greater than 1, the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments to `low` or `high`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n // 2` if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `st` is a set containing the value `n // 2`, and `mid` is `n // 2`**
