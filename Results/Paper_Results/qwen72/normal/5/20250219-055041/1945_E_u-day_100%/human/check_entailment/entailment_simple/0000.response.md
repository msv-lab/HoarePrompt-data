### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_3()` for each test case.
   - `func_1()` is used to read the integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - `func_2()` is used to read the permutation `arr` from the input and convert it into a list.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - The program searches for the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` and stores it in `pos`. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains `-1`.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to `n`.
   - It then performs a binary search to find the position `low` such that `arr[low]` is the largest element less than or equal to `k` and `arr[high]` is the smallest element greater than `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, the program prints `0` (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, the program prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a single swap that will make `arr[low]` equal to `k`.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_2` Misinterpretation:**
  - The comment in `func_2` states that it returns an empty list, which is incorrect. The function should return a list of integers from the input, and it does so correctly using `func_1()`.

- **Binary Search Initialization:**
  - The binary search initializes `high` to `n`, which is correct for the given problem. However, the loop condition `while low + 1 < high` is correct, but it might not always find the exact position of `k` if the permutation is not sorted.

- **Handling Unsorted Permutations:**
  - The program assumes that the permutation is unsorted and tries to find the position of `k` using a binary search. However, the binary search is only effective if the array is sorted. The program does not sort the array or ensure that the array is sorted before performing the binary search.
  - The program attempts to correct the position of `k` by swapping it with the element at `low` if `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`. This approach might not always work correctly, especially if the permutation is highly unsorted.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is the first or last element in the permutation, or where `k` is not present in the permutation. The binary search might not find the correct position in these cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because it does not ensure that the permutation is sorted before performing the binary search, which is a fundamental requirement for binary search to work correctly. Additionally, the approach to correct the position of `k` by swapping might not always work as intended, especially in highly unsorted permutations.

### Correctness: **False**
