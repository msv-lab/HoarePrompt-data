The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If the element at the first position of the list `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is 1. Otherwise, `pos` retains its initial value.**
