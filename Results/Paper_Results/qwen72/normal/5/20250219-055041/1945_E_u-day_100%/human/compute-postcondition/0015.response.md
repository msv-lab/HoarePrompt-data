Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set `st`, which is now an empty set. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
