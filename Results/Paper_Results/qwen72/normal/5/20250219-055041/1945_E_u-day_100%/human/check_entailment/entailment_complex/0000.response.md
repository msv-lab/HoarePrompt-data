Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads a sequence of integers from the input and returns them as a map object.
   - `func_2` is supposed to convert the map object from `func_1` into a list, but there is a mistake in the description. The correct behavior is that `func_2` returns a list of integers read from the input.

2. **Permutation and Binary Search**:
   - `func_3` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the permutation size `n` and the target number `k` using `func_1`.
   - It reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2`.
   - It then searches for the index of `k` in `arr` and stores it in `pos`.
   - The function performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`.

3. **Output**:
   - If `k` is found at `arr[low]`, it prints `0` (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `k` is not found at `arr[low]`, it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a single swap is needed to move `k` to the correct position.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function correctly identifies the position of `k` in the permutation.
   - The binary search is correctly implemented to find the appropriate `low` and `high` indices.
   - The output format is correct: it prints the number of swaps and the indices for the swap if needed.
   - The function ensures that the binary search will find `k` after at most one swap, which is within the allowed limit of 2 swaps.

However, there is a critical issue in the implementation:
- `func_2` is described incorrectly. It should return a list of integers, but the description suggests it returns an empty list. This is a mistake in the description, not in the actual implementation.

Given the correct implementation of `func_2` (which should return a list of integers), the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
