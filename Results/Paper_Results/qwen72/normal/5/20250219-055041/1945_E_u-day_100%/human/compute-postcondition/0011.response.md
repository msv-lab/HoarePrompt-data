Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pos` is 2.** 

The value of `pos` is now set to the value of `i`, which is 2. The initial condition that if the element at the first position of the list `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is 1, is no longer relevant since `pos` has been explicitly set to 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
