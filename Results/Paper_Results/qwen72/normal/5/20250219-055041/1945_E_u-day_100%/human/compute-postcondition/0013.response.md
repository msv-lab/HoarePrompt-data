Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- If the value `k` is present in the list `arr`, the variable `pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`.
- If `k` is not found in `arr`, the variable `pos` will still be -1, as it was initially.
