The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to ensure the loop executes.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` as returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is -1.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
