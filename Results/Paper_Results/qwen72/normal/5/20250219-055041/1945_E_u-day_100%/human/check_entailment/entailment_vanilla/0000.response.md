### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - After the swaps, we perform a binary search to find the position of `x`.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation**:
   - Binary search works efficiently on sorted arrays. However, in this problem, the array is a permutation, which is not necessarily sorted.
   - The binary search algorithm provided in the problem is slightly different from the standard binary search. It uses `l = 1` and `r = n + 1` initially and ends when `r - l = 1`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program first reads the input values for `n` and `x` and the permutation `arr`.
   - It then finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
   - The binary search is performed to find the position `low` where `x` should be if the permutation were sorted.
   - If `arr[low]` is already equal to `x`, no swaps are needed, and the program outputs `0`.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, the program performs a single swap between `low` and `pos` and outputs `1` followed by the indices of the swap.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The program correctly identifies the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
   - The binary search is performed to find the position `low` where `x` should be if the permutation were sorted.
   - If `arr[low]` is not `x`, the program swaps `arr[low]` with `arr[pos]` to place `x` at the correct position.
   - The program ensures that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position after the swap.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position by outputting `0`.
   - The program handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by performing a single swap, which is within the allowed limit of 2 swaps.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program reads the input efficiently using `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - The binary search runs in \(O(\log n)\) time, which is efficient for the given constraints.
   - The swap operation is \(O(1)\), which is also efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem. It ensures that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x` by performing at most one swap.

**Correctness: True**
