The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `low + 1 < high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `low + 1` must be less than `high`, which means `1 < n` or `n > 1`.

Given that `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute (since `n > 1`).

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 1, `st` is an empty set**
