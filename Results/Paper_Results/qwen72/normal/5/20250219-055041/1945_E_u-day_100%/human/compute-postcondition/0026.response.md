Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to its initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr` or is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n // 2` if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `st` is a set containing the values `n // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- The set `st` initially contains the value `n // 2`.
- After executing `st.add(mid)`, the set `st` now contains both `n // 2` and `mid`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `pos`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
