Output State: **`s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}), `cost` is 0.** 

The initial state specifies that `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200,000, and each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'. The code snippet initializes the variable `cost` to 0. Since no other operations are performed, the state of `s` remains unchanged, and `cost` is now 0.
