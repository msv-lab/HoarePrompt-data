The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string. Given the initial state, `s` is a binary string with a length of at least 2, which ensures that the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first character in `s` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}), `i` is the first character of `s`, `cost` is 0, `one` is 0**
