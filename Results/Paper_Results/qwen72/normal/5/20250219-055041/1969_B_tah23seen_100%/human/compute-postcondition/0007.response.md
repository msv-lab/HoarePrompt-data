Output State: **`s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}), `i` is the first character of `s`, `cost` is 1, `one` is 0, the first character of `s` is '0', and `one` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `s` is a binary string, `i` is the first character of `s`, `cost` is 0, `one` is 0, the first character of `s` is '0', and `one` is greater than 0.
- The code snippet `cost += one + 1` updates the value of `cost` by adding `one + 1` to it.
- Since `one` is 0, `one + 1` equals 1.
- Therefore, `cost` is updated from 0 to 1.
- The other variables (`s`, `i`, `one`) remain unchanged, and the condition that the first character of `s` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0 still holds.
