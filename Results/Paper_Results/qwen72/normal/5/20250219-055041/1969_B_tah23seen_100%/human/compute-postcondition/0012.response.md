Output State: **`s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}), `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is '1', then `cost` is 2 and `one` is 1. If `i` is '0', then `cost` is 1 or 2, and `one` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `cost += one + 1` increments the value of `cost` by the value of `one` plus 1.
- If `i` is '1', then `cost` was initially 0 and `one` is 1. After executing the code, `cost` becomes 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.
- If `i` is '0', then `cost` was initially 0 or 1, and `one` is 0. After executing the code, `cost` becomes 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 or 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.
- The value of `s` and `i` remain unchanged.
