Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` calculates the cost based on a flawed logic. Specifically, it incorrectly adds the number of '1's plus one to the cost every time it encounters a '0' after a '1'. This does not account for the optimal way to sort the string using cyclic shifts of substrings.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the following:

1. If the string is already sorted (i.e., all '0's come before all '1's), the cost is 0.
2. If the string contains a sequence of '1's followed by '0's, the optimal strategy is to cyclically shift the substring that starts with the first '1' and ends with the last '0' in the string. The cost of this operation is the length of this substring.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t -= 1

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    if s == '0' * n or s == '1' * n:
        return 0  # Already sorted
    
    # Find the first '1' and the last '0'
    first_one = s.find('1')
    last_zero = s.rfind('0')
    
    # If there are no '1's or no '0's, the string is already sorted
    if first_one == -1 or last_zero == -1:
        return 0
    
    # The cost is the length of the substring from the first '1' to the last '0'
    cost = last_zero - first_one + 1
    
    return cost
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the minimum cost to sort the binary string by finding the first '1' and the last '0' and calculating the cost of the cyclic shift of the substring between them.
