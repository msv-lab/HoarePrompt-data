Output State: **`s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}), `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is '1', then `cost` is 0 and `one` is 2. If `i` is '0', then `cost` is 0 or 1, and `one` is 1.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `one` is incremented by 1.
- If `i` is '1', `one` was initially 1, so after the increment, `one` is 2.
- If `i` is '0', `one` was initially 0, so after the increment, `one` is 1.
- The value of `cost` remains unchanged based on the initial conditions.
