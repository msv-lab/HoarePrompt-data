The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `s` and returns an integer `cost`. The `cost` is calculated by iterating through the string `s` and for each '0' encountered after at least one '1', the cost is incremented by the number of '1's seen so far plus one. The final state of the program is that `s` remains unchanged, and `cost` represents the total accumulated cost based on the specified logic.
