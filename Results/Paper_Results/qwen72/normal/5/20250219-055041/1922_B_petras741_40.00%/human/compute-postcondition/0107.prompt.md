Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[0]` in the list `w`, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `res` is the result of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[0]` in the list `w` plus the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[1]` in the list `w`, `res` is updated to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * (rho - q[eta[1]])`. If `j` is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with `j` still equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 2, `rho` is the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[0]` in the list `w` plus the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[1]` in the list `w` plus the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[2]` in the list `w`. If `j` > 1000, `res` is updated to `res + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`, `j`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, `j` is 3, `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 3, `rho` is the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[0]` in the list `w` plus the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[1]` in the list `w` plus the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[2]` in the list `w` plus the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[3]` in the list `w`. If `j` > 1000, `res` is increased by `q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
