Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `w`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, and `buffer` remain unchanged.
- The value of `n` is still an input integer, and its value is not affected by this code snippet.
- The list `w` is now populated with the integers derived from the input.
