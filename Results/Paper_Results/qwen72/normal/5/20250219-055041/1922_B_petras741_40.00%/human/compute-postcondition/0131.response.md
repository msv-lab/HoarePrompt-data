Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing `[0, 1]` if `q[0]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is a list containing `[1]`.** 

In natural language: The value of `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, and `j` remains 1. The list `eta` now contains the value 1, either as the second element if `q[0]` was greater than 0 (making `eta` `[0, 1]`), or as the only element if `q[0]` was not greater than 0 (making `eta` `[1]`).
