Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `buffer` is an empty list.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
   - `w` is a list of integers derived from the input.
   - `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0.
   - `eta_ln` is 1.
   - `rho` is the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[0]` in the list `w`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken 3 at a time, which is a common formula for combinations: \( \binom{n}{3} \).
   - The `//` operator performs integer division, which means the result will be an integer.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The value of `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0.
   - The formula `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` will compute the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items without regard to order.

Given the initial state and the formula, the output will be the integer result of the combination formula for `n` items taken 3 at a time.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is the input integer)**
