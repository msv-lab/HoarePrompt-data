Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`.**

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, with `n` being greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `j` still being `n`, `eta` still being the list of indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` still being the length of `eta`. Additionally, `rho` is now equal to the value of `q` at the index specified by the first element of `eta`.
