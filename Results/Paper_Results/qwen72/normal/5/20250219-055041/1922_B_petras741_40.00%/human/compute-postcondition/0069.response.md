Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, and `j` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 1.
- The `buffer` list remains empty.
- The variable `n` is the input integer, and it has not changed.
- The list `w` is still the list of integers derived from the input.
- The list `q` now has a length of `n + 1`, and each element at index `k` in `q` represents the number of times the integer `k` appears in the list `w`.
- The loop index `j` is `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
