Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `j` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 0.
- The `buffer` list remains empty.
- The variable `n` remains the same input integer, which is greater than or equal to 3.
- The list `w` remains unchanged, containing the same integers derived from the input.
- The list `q` is now a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, but the values at the indices corresponding to the elements of `w` (i.e., `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]`) are each incremented by 1.
- The loop counter `j` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
