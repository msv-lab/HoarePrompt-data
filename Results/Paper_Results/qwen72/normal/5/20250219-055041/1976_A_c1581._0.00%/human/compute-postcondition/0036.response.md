Output State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `i` is n-1, `char` is the last character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to n-1. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digit is found.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the index of the last character in the `password` string.
- The variable `char` will be the last character of the `password` string.
- The variable `last_digit_index` will be the index of the last digit in the `password` string if a digit is found, or it will remain -1 if no digit is found.
- If at any point a non-digit character is encountered after a digit has been found (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not -1), the program will return 'NO' and terminate. Otherwise, the loop will complete without returning 'NO'.
