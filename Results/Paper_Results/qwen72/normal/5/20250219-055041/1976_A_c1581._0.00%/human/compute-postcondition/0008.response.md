The only objects in the loop head are `char` and `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If there are more characters in `password`, the loop will execute again with the next character.

At the end of the last iteration, `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and `char` is the first character of `password`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must now be the second character of `password`, and the length of `password` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`password` is a string of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the second character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list, and `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password`.**
