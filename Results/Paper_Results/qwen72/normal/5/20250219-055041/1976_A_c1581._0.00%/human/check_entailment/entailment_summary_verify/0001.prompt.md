You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `password` of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It returns 'YES' if the following conditions are met: all digits in the password are in non-decreasing order, all letters in the password are in non-decreasing order, and no letter appears after a digit in the password. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, extracting the length `n` and the password string from the list `data`.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating each password.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - The program iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - The program also keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), the function returns `'NO'` because the password violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(digits)`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(letters)`.
   - If either the digits or letters are not sorted, the function returns `'NO'`.
   - If all conditions are satisfied, the function returns `'YES'`.

4. **Output:**
   - The results of each test case are stored in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This is implicitly handled by the input constraints and the program's logic.
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter. This is checked by the `last_digit_index` logic.
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing `digits` to `sorted(digits)`.
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing `letters` to `sorted(letters)`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles cases where the password consists only of digits or only of letters.
- The program correctly handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem constraints ensure `1 \le n \le 20`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the required conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies and returns "YES" or "NO" based on the given criteria.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
