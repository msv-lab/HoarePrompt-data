The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `char`, and the string `password`. So, we can only adjust these.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- `i` is 0.
- `char` is the first character of `password`.
- If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 0. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is -1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop must iterate over the next character in `password`.
- The value of `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `char` must be the second character of `password`.

The state of `last_digit_index` is not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here.

State: **`password` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `password`.**
