### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, extracting the length `n` and the password string from the list `data`.
   - This part of the code is correct and follows the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating each password.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - The program iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - The program also keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), the function returns `'NO'` because the password violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter.
   - This logic correctly ensures that no letter appears after a digit in the password.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(digits)`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(letters)`.
   - If either the digits or letters are not sorted, the function returns `'NO'`.
   - If all conditions are satisfied, the function returns `'YES'`.
   - This logic correctly ensures that all digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Output:**
   - The results of each test case are stored in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.
   - This part of the code is correct and follows the output format specified in the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles cases where the password consists only of digits or only of letters.
- The program correctly handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem constraints ensure `1 \le n \le 20`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the required conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies and returns "YES" or "NO" based on the given criteria.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program meets all the specified conditions and handles the input and output correctly.

Final: **True**
