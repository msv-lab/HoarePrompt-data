You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

input = sys.stdin.read

    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2

If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to n-1. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digit is found.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `password` of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It returns 'YES' if the following conditions are met: all digits in the password are in non-decreasing order, all letters in the password are in non-decreasing order, and no letter appears after a digit in the password. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by extracting the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Character Classification**: The function `func_1` classifies each character in the password as either a digit or a letter and appends them to separate lists (`digits` and `letters`).

3. **Digit After Letter Check**: The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. It does this by keeping track of the last index where a digit was found. If a letter is found after a digit, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the lists of digits and letters with their sorted versions.

5. **Output**: The program collects the results of each test case and prints them in the required format.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, ensuring that it meets all the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
