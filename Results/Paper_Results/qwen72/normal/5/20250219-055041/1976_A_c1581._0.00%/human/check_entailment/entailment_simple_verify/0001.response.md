### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, extracting the length `n` and the password string from the list `data`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem's input format.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating each password.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - The program iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - This part correctly separates the digits and letters from the password.

3. **Checking for Digits After Letters:**
   - The program keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), the function returns `'NO'` because the password violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter.
   - This logic is correct and ensures that no digit appears after a letter.

4. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(digits)`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(letters)`.
   - If either the digits or letters are not sorted, the function returns `'NO'`.
   - If all conditions are satisfied, the function returns `'YES'`.
   - This part of the program correctly implements the sorting conditions for both digits and letters.

5. **Output:**
   - The results of each test case are stored in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.
   - This part is correct and follows the output format.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles cases where the password consists only of digits or only of letters.
- The program correctly handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem constraints ensure `1 \le n \le 20`).

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code confirms that the program maintains the correct state at each key point:
  - Before the function call, the password is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
  - After separating digits and letters, the program correctly identifies the last index of a digit.
  - The program correctly returns `'NO'` if a letter is found after a digit.
  - The program correctly checks the sorting of digits and letters and returns `'NO'` if either is not sorted.
  - If all conditions are met, the program returns `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the required conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies and returns "YES" or "NO" based on the given criteria.
