Output State: **`iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `iterable2` is 2, `x` and `a` are input integers. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `a` and `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `a` twice, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing `a` and `a` is appended to `no`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`.
- If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `a` and `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. After appending `a` to `no`, `no` becomes a list containing `a`.
- If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `a` twice, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. After appending `a` to `no`, `no` becomes a list containing `a`.
- If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing `a`. After appending `a` to `no`, `no` becomes a list containing `a` twice.
- All other variables (`iterable`, `loop`, `num`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
