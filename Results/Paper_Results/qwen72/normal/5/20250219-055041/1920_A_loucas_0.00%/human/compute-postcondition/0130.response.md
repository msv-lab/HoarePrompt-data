Output State: **`big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is the first integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`, `num` is equal to `i`, and the current value of `i` is not in `no`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `big`, `less`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
