Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from stdin, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a number of constraints, where each constraint is defined by a type (1, 2, or 3) and a value. The function processes these constraints and writes the output to stdout. The output for each test case is not specified in the given information, but it is implied that the function will produce some result based on the constraints provided.**
