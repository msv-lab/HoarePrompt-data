The function `func` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and writes the output to stdout. Each test case includes constraints of three types (1, 2, and 3) with associated values. The function identifies the first integer within the range from the maximum value of type 1 constraints to the minimum value of type 2 constraints that is not present in the type 3 constraints. If such an integer is found, it is printed; otherwise, 0 is printed. The function completes all test cases, and the final state is that all input has been processed and the corresponding outputs have been written to stdout.
