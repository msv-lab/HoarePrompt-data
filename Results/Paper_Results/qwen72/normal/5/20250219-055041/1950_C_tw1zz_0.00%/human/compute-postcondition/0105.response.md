Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string, `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `h` is not equal to '08', '07', '09', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', or '17'. If `h` is '18', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '19', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '20', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '21', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '22', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '23', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.***
