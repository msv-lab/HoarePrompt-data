To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions that affect the values of `h1`, `m`, and `time`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string.
- `m1` is equal to the minute part of the input time as a string.
- `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string.
- `h` and `m` are updated to the hour and minute parts of the new input time.

### Conditions:
- If `h` is '01', `h1` is set to '01' and `time` is set to 'AM'.
- If `h` is '02', `h1` is set to '02' and `time` is set to 'AM'.
- If `h` is '03', `h1` is set to '03' and `time` is set to 'AM'.
- If `h` is '04', `h1` is set to '04' and `time` is set to 'AM'.
- If `h` is '05', `h1` is set to '05' and `time` is set to 'AM'.
- If `h` is '06', `h1` is set to '06' and `time` is set to 'AM'.
- If `h` is between '07' and '12', `h1` is set to the corresponding hour and `time` is set to 'AM'.
- If `h` is between '13' and '23' or '00', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.) and `time` is set to 'PM'.
- Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

### Analysis:
1. **Minute Part (`m`)**:
   - `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string. This value is directly taken from the input time `s`.

2. **Hour Part (`h`)**:
   - `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string. This value is also directly taken from the input time `s`.

3. **12-Hour Format (`h1`)**:
   - Based on the hour part `h`, `h1` is updated to the corresponding 12-hour format hour.
   - If `h` is between '01' and '06', `h1` is set to the same value as `h` and `time` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is between '07' and '12', `h1` is set to the same value as `h` and `time` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is between '13' and '23' or '00', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.) and `time` is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` does not fall into any of these ranges, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the input time `s` is "15:30".

1. **Extract Hour and Minute**:
   - `h = '15'`
   - `m = '30'`

2. **Determine `h1` and `time`**:
   - Since `h` is '15', which is between '13' and '23', `h1` is set to '03' (15 - 12 = 3) and `time` is set to 'PM'.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will concatenate `h1`, ':', `m`, and `time` with no separators.
   - Therefore, the output will be "03:30 PM".

### General Output:
Based on the initial state and the conditions, the `print` statement will output the time in 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the hour part of the input time.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the 12-hour format hour, m is the minute part, and time is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the conditions described)**

For the specific example of `s = "15:30"`:
Output: **03:30 PM**
