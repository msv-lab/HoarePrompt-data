Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string, `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour based on the new value of `h`, `time` is set to 'AM' or 'PM' based on the new value of `h`.**

Explanation:
- `h` and `m` are updated to the hour and minute parts of the new input time, respectively.
- `m1` remains equal to `m` because `m1` is assigned the value of `m` in the initial state.
- `h1` and `time` are updated based on the new value of `h` according to the conditions specified in the initial state.
