The function processes an integer `t` and a series of input times in 24-hour format "hh:mm". For each input time, it converts the hour part to a 12-hour format and appends 'AM' or 'PM' accordingly. The minute part remains unchanged. The function prints the converted 12-hour format time for each input time. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and the input times have been converted and printed in 12-hour format.
