### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format `hh:mm` using `input().split(':')` and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour `h` from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, it sets `h1` to the same value as `h` and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, it sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM`. This is incorrect because `12:00` in 24-hour format should be `12:00 PM` in 12-hour format.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it sets `h1` to the corresponding hour in 12-hour format (e.g., `13` becomes `01`, `14` becomes `02`, etc.) and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, it sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`. This is correct because `00:00` in 24-hour format should be `12:00 AM` in 12-hour format.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.
   - The program ensures that leading zeros are preserved in the output, as required by the problem description.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for most cases.
- However, the program incorrectly sets `12:00` to `12:00 AM` instead of `12:00 PM`.
- The program correctly handles the `00:00` case, converting it to `12:00 AM`.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has a critical error in handling the `12:00` case. This error means that the program does not meet all the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
