Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.
   - `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string.
   - The conditions for `h1` and `time` are as follows:
     - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '04', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '05' to '12', `h1` is equal to `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.) and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
     - Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print` statement will concatenate the values of `h1`, `':', `m`, `' '`, and `time` without any separators.
   - The value of `h1` will depend on the hour part `h` of the input time `s`.
   - The value of `m` will be the minute part of the input time `s`.
   - The value of `time` will be either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour part `h`.

Let's consider the possible values of `h` and their corresponding `h1` and `time`:

- If `h` is '01' to '12', `h1` will be the same as `h` and `time` will be 'AM'.
- If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` will be the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and `time` will be 'PM'.
- If `h` is '00', `h1` will be '12' and `time` will be 'PM'.
- If `h` is any other value (which should not happen since `s` is a valid time in 24-hour format), `h1` and `time` will be empty strings.

Given the valid input time `s` in 24-hour format, the output will be in the format `h1:m time`.

**Example:**
- If `s` is '03:45', then `h` is '03', `m` is '45', `h1` is '03', and `time` is 'AM'.
  - Output: **03:45 AM**

- If `s` is '15:30', then `h` is '15', `m` is '30', `h1` is '03', and `time` is 'PM'.
  - Output: **03:30 PM**

- If `s` is '00:00', then `h` is '00', `m` is '00', `h1` is '12', and `time` is 'PM'.
  - Output: **12:00 PM**

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given conditions.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour part in 12-hour format and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour part of the input time s)**
