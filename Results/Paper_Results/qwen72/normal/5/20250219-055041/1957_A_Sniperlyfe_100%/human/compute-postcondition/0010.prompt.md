You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the lengths of sticks for a test case. The length of arr is between 1 and 100, inclusive, and each inner list contains between 1 and 100 integers, inclusive, with each integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of lists with the same content as the initial state. `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an inner list from `arr`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that specific inner list appears in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3. Each value in the `freq` dictionary represents the number of times a specific inner list appears in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list contains integers representing stick lengths. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique inner list by 3.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3. Each value in the `freq` dictionary represents the number of times a specific inner list appears in `arr`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
