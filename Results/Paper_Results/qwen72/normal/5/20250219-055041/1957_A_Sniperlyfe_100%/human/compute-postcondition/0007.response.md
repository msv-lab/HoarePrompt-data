Output State: **`arr` is a list of lists with the same content as the initial state. `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an inner list from `arr`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that specific inner list appears in `arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `arr` remains unchanged, and the dictionary `freq` contains each unique inner list from `arr` as a key. The value associated with each key is the count of how many times that inner list appears in `arr`.
