The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list contains integers representing the lengths of sticks for a test case. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 100, inclusive, and each inner list contains between 1 and 100 integers, inclusive, with each integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3. Each value in the `freq` dictionary represents the number of times a specific inner list appears in `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list contains integers representing stick lengths. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique inner list by 3.**
