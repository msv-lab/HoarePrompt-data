### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and returns it as an integer.
   - `func_2` reads the integers `n` and `x` for each test case and returns them as a map object.
   - `func_3` reads the permutation `p` for each test case and returns it as a list of integers.

2. **Binary Search with Swaps:**
   - The main logic of the program is to perform a binary search on the permutation `p` to find the element `x`.
   - Before running the binary search, the program can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the elements in `p` to ensure the binary search works correctly.
   - The program maintains a `num_indx` dictionary to keep track of the indices of each element in the permutation.
   - It also maintains a `seen` list to track which elements have been considered during the binary search.

3. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - The binary search loop runs until `left + 1 < right`.
   - It calculates the middle index `mid` and updates the `seen` list to mark the element at `p[mid]` as seen.
   - If `p[mid] <= x`, it updates `left` to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `right` to `mid`.

4. **Post-Search Logic:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `p[left]` is equal to `x`.
   - If `p[left]` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `x` is not seen in the `seen` list, it prints `1` and the indices to swap `p[left]` with `x`.
   - If `x` is seen in the `seen` list, it prints `2` and the indices to swap `p[left]` with the first unseen element and then swap that element with `x`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The binary search logic is implemented correctly, but it is applied to an unsorted permutation, which is the core challenge of the problem.
- The program attempts to rearrange the permutation using up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search can find the element `x`.
- The logic for determining the swaps is based on the `seen` list and the `num_indx` dictionary, which are used to track the positions of elements and whether they have been considered during the search.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for determining the swaps and performing the binary search is correct.
- The program ensures that the binary search can find the element `x` by performing the necessary swaps.
- The constraints and requirements of the problem are met, including the limit on the number of swaps and the handling of multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
