Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not perform any operations to rearrange the permutation before applying the binary search, nor does it implement the binary search algorithm. The functions defined in the program are just placeholders for reading input and do not perform the required logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect for all test cases.
