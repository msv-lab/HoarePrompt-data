Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is insufficient to solve the problem as described. The problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping) any number of times. The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for this operation, and thus it will fail to correctly identify cases where the array can be sorted through such operations.

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`:
- The array is not sorted, so `func_1` will return "No".
- However, by splitting the array into `x = [3]` and `y = [1, 2]` and swapping them, we get `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order. Therefore, the correct output should be "Yes".

Since the program does not handle this scenario correctly, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is valid.

Final: **False**
