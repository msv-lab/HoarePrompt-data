Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the last valid slice of `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`, `results` is a list containing `t` values, each value being the result of calling `func_1` on the corresponding `arr` in each iteration, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)` in the last iteration.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `t` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `n` is the integer value of the last `n` read from `data`, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `arr` is the list of `n` integers obtained from the last valid slice of `data` that was processed in the loop.
- `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- `index` is updated to `1 + t * (1 + n)`, which is the position in `data` just after the last element processed by the loop.
- `results` is a list containing `t` values, where each value is the result of calling `func_1` on the corresponding `arr` in each iteration.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)` in the last iteration of the loop.
