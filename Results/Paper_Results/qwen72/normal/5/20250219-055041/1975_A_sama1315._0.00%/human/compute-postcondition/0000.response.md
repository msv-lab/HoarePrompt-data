The provided code snippet assigns the `read` method of `sys.stdin` to the variable `input`. This changes the behavior of the `input` function to read from standard input (stdin) as a whole, rather than line by line. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The `input` function now reads from standard input as a whole.**
