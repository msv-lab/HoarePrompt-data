Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 3 + 2n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `index` is incremented by `n`, so the new value of `index` is `3 + n + n`, which simplifies to `3 + 2n`.
- All other variables remain unchanged, so the initial state of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `data`, `results`, and `result` still holds true.
