Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 3 + n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains greater than 1.
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `arr` is updated to a new list of `n` integers, obtained from converting the strings in `data[index:index + n]` to integers.
- `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- `index` remains 3 + n.
- `results` remains a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.
- `result` remains the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.
- `n` is now the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.
