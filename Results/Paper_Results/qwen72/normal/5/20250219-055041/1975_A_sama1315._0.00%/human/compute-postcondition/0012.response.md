Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 2 + n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.
- The list `results` is updated to include the value of `result`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `data`, `index`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
