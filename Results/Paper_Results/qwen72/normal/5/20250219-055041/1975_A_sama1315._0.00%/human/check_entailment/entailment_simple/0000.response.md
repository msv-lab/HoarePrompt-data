### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - This function is correct for the specific task of checking if the array is sorted, but it does not consider the possibility of making the array sorted by performing the allowed operation (splitting and swapping the array).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, `func_1` is not the correct function to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation.

3. **Correct Logic for the Problem**:
   - To determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping, we need to find a point where the array can be split such that the prefix and suffix, when swapped, form a non-decreasing array.
   - This can be done by finding the first index `i` where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`, and then checking if the array can be split at this index and the resulting array is non-decreasing.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`:
     - The first index where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]` is `4` (where `5 > 1`).
     - Splitting at this index gives `x = [1, 1, 4, 5]` and `y = [1, 4]`.
     - Swapping gives `y + x = [1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5]`, which is not sorted.
     - Therefore, the correct answer should be 'No', but `func_1` returns 'No' because the array is not already sorted.
   - For the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`:
     - The first index where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]` is `1` (where `9 > 2`).
     - Splitting at this index gives `x = [7, 9]` and `y = [2, 2, 3]`.
     - Swapping gives `y + x = [2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted.
     - Therefore, the correct answer should be 'Yes', but `func_1` returns 'No' because the array is not already sorted.
   - For the array `[1, 2, 3]`:
     - The array is already sorted, so the correct answer is 'Yes'.
     - `func_1` returns 'Yes', which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the logic to check if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation. Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
