**Reasoning:**

The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping them. The provided functions need to be evaluated to see if they correctly implement this logic.

1. **func_1**:
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If there is at least one pair of consecutive elements where the first is greater than the second, it returns 'No'.
   - However, this function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.

2. **func_2**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it extracts the array and calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted.
   - The results are collected and printed.

Given the problem description, the function `func_1` is not sufficient because it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not account for the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation. The correct approach would involve checking if there exists a split point such that the concatenated parts form a non-decreasing array.

**Correctness: False**

The provided program is incorrect because `func_1` does not implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not enough to solve the problem.
