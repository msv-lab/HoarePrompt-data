Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 3 + 2n + 1, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)` and the new value `result` appended to it, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

The code updates the `arr` variable to be a list of `n` integers, where each integer is obtained by converting the corresponding string from the slice `data[index:index + n]` to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `data`, `index`, `results`, and `result` remain unchanged.
