Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 3 + 2n + 1 + n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)` and the new value `result` appended to it, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

Explanation:
- The code `result = func_1(arr)` assigns the value returned by `func_1(arr)` to the variable `result`.
- The variable `results` is updated to include the new value of `result`, so it now contains two elements: the original value returned by `func_1(arr)` and the new value of `result`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `data`, `index`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
