The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `arr`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return conditions are not provided in the given information. Therefore, I will describe the parameters and the expected return type without specifying the exact return logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 1000), `n` (an integer between 2 and 50), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 1,000,000). The function returns a value based on these parameters.**
