Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 3 + 2n + 1 + n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)` and the new value `result` appended to it, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`.
- The value of `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.
- The initial state specifies that `results` already contains the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, so after appending `result` again, `results` will contain two instances of the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `data`, `index`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input
- `index` is 3 + 2n + 1 + n
- `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)` and the new value `result` appended to it
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`
