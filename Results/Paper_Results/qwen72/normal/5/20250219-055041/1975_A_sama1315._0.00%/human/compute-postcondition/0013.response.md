The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop variable, typically used when the actual value is not needed) and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, it does not need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 2 + n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

However, to be more precise, since `t` is the only variable that changes in the loop head:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of `n` integers obtained from `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 2 + n, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(arr)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**
