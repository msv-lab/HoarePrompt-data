Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `(n // 4) // 2` and must be at least 4, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, but the execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
