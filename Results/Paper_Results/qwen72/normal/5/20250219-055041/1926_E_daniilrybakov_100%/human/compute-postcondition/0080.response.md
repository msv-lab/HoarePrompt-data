Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `(n // 4) // 2` and must be at least 4, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.***
