Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `(n // 2)`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s < k` and `k <= s + x`.**

In natural language, the postcondition describes the following state:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is the result of `n` divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `s` is 0.
- `m` is 1.
- `x` is the result of `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `k` is greater than `s` (which is 0) and less than or equal to the sum of `s` and `x` (which is `x` since `s` is 0).
