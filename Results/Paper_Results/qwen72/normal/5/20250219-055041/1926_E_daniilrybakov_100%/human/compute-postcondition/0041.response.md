The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is equal to `n // 2`, which means `n` has been halved (integer division). For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0 after being halved.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is equal to `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
