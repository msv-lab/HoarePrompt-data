Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `(n // 4)` and must be at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
