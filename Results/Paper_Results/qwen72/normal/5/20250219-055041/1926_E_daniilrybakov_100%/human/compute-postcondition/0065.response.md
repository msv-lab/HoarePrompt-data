Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `(n // 2)`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s < k` and `k <= s + x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
