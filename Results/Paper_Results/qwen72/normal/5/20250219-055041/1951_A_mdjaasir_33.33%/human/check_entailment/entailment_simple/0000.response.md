### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**:
   - The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is defined to take two integer parameters, `start` and `end`, which represent a range of folder names.
   - The function is expected to work with valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

2. **Current Directory and Subfolders**:
   - The function correctly gets the current working directory using `os.getcwd()`.
   - It then lists all subdirectories in the current directory using a list comprehension with `os.scandir()` and `f.is_dir()`.

3. **Folder Name Check**:
   - For each subfolder, the function checks if the folder name is a digit and falls within the specified range `[start, end]`.
   - This is done using `folder_name.isdigit()` and `start <= int(folder_name) <= end`.

4. **HTML Files in Subfolders**:
   - If the folder name is within the specified range, the function lists all `.html` files in that subfolder using `os.listdir(folder)` and a list comprehension with `f.endswith('.html')`.

5. **File Generation**:
   - For each `.html` file found, the function generates two new files: one with `-ac.py` appended to the base name and another with `-wa.py` appended.
   - It uses `os.path.splitext(html_file)[0]` to get the base name of the HTML file.
   - The new files are created using `open(ac_file, 'w').close()` and `open(wa_file, 'w').close()`.
   - The function prints the names of the generated files.

6. **Main Block**:
   - The main block specifies the range `start_range = 1951` and `end_range = 1980`.
   - It calls the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start_range, end_range)`.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
- The annotated program provided is unrelated to the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function. It appears to be a separate program that reads input and checks for certain conditions in a string.
- The annotated program does not affect the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

### Conclusion:
- The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is logically correct and follows the problem description.
- The annotated program is irrelevant to the function's correctness.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
