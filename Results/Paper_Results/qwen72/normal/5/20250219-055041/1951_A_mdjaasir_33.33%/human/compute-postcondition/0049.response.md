The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `start` and `end` are integers where `start <= end`, and the current directory contains subfolders with names that can be interpreted as integers within the range [start, end]. The function returns a list of subfolder names that are integers within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function returns a list of subfolder names in the current directory that are integers within the range [start, end], where `start` and `end` are integers and `start <= end`.**
