The function reads an integer `t` from the user, and for each of the `t` iterations, it reads another integer `n` and a string `a` from the user. It then checks the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `a`. If the count of '1' is 0, or greater than 2 and even, or exactly 2 with the first '1' not followed by another '1', it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value or modify the state of the program beyond the scope of its execution.
