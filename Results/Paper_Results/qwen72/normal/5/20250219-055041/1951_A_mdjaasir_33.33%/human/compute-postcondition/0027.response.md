The provided Python code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state and will always print the same string.

Output: **YES**
