Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` remains unchanged.** 

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`a`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans`, and `j`) retain their previous values or conditions.
