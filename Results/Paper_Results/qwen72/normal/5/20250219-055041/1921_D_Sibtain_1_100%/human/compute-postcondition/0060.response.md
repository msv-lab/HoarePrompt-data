Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 1 or 2, `k` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute one more time if the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `_`. If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal to each other, or if `len(a) == 1`, the program retains the above state. `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`. `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - 1]` and `c[len(c) - 1]`. If `t2` > `t1`, then `j` is set to 2. Otherwise, `i` is set to 1 and `j` remains 1.***
