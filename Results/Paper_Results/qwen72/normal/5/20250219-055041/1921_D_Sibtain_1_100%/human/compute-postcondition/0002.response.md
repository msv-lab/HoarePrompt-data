Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer. `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `_` is not explicitly defined.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input.
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`.
- The variable `_` is not affected by this code and remains undefined.
- The values of `n` and `m` are still the same as they were in the initial state.
- The new list `a` contains the integers from the input, which are positive integers between 1 and 100.
