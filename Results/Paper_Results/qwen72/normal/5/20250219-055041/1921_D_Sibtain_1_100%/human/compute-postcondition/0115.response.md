To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element.
   - `k` is `len(a) - 1`, which means `k` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `i` is the number of iterations where `t2 <= t1`.
   - `j` is 1 + the number of iterations where `t2 > t1`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences (`max(t1, t2)`) for each iteration.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a sorted list, so the elements are in non-decreasing order.
   - `k` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `i` and `j` are counts of iterations based on the comparison between `t1` and `t2`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration.

3. **Determining `t1` and `t2`:**
   - The problem does not explicitly define `t1` and `t2`, but based on the context, they are likely elements from the list `a` or derived from the list `a` in some way.
   - Since `a` is sorted, the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in `a` will be between the smallest and the largest elements in the list.

4. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - The maximum absolute difference between any two elements in a sorted list `a` is `a[k] - a[0]`, where `a[k]` is the largest element and `a[0]` is the smallest element.
   - If `t1` and `t2` are elements from the list `a`, the maximum absolute difference `max(t1, t2)` in each iteration will be `a[k] - a[0]`.
   - The number of iterations is not specified, but since `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences, if there are `n` iterations, `ans` will be `n * (a[k] - a[0])`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `ans` will be the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration.
   - Since the exact number of iterations is not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the number of iterations and the maximum absolute difference.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each iteration, and the maximum absolute difference is a[k] - a[0], with k being the index of the last element in the sorted list a)**
