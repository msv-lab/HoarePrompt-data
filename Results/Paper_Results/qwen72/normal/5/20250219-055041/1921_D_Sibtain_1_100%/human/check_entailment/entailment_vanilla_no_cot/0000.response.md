Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases, each with the required inputs for `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal to each other. If so, it prints `0` because the maximum difference is zero.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order and the array `c` in descending order. This sorting strategy helps in maximizing the absolute differences between corresponding elements.

4. **Difference Calculation**: The program uses a two-pointer approach to calculate the maximum possible difference `D`. It iterates through the array `a` and for each element, it considers the maximum difference between the current element in `a` and either the current element in `c` (from the start) or the current element in `c` (from the end). It then adds the maximum of these two differences to the total difference `ans`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem's requirements and should produce the correct output for the given examples and other valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
