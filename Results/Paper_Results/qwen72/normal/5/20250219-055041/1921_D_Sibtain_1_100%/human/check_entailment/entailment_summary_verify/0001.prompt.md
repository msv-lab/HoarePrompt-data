You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0]):
            print(0)
            continue
        a.sort()
        c.sort(reverse=True)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
            continue
        (i, j, ans) = (0, 1, 0)
        for k in range(len(a)):
            t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
            t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
            if t2 > t1:
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
            ans += max(t1, t2)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list `a` of `n` positive integers and a list `c` of `m` positive integers. If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order, then calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements from the sorted lists `a` and `c`. This sum is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of the arrays `a` and `c` respectively.
   - It then reads the elements of `a` and `c`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal. If so, it prints `0` because the difference will be zero.
   - This is a valid check and handles the edge case correctly.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order and the array `c` in descending order.
   - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order helps in maximizing the absolute differences between corresponding elements.

4. **Single Element Case:**
   - If `a` has only one element, the program calculates the maximum difference between this element and any element in `c`.
   - This is correct because the maximum difference for a single element is the maximum of the absolute differences with the largest and smallest elements in `c`.

5. **General Case:**
   - The program initializes indices `i` and `j` to 0 and 1 respectively, and an answer variable `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through the elements of `a` and for each element, it calculates two potential differences:
     - `t1` is the absolute difference between the current element in `a` and the corresponding element in `c` at index `i`.
     - `t2` is the absolute difference between the current element in `a` and the corresponding element in `c` at index `len(c) - j`.
   - It then updates the indices `i` and `j` based on which difference is larger and adds the larger difference to `ans`.
   - This approach ensures that the maximum possible difference is considered at each step.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated maximum difference `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the special case where all elements in both arrays are the same.
- The sorting and index manipulation logic is designed to maximize the total difference, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
- The program correctly calculates the maximum difference for the single element case.
- The general case logic ensures that the maximum possible differences are considered at each step.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
