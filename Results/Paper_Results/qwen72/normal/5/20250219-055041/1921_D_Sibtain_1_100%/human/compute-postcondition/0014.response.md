Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, and `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order. `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0. If the length of `a` is 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds to the next statement after the if block.**
