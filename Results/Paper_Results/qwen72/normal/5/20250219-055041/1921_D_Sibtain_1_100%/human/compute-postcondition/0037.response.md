Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` > `t1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 4] - c[len(c) - 4])`. Otherwise, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`.**
