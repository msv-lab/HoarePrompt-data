Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the number of iterations where `t2 <= t1`, `j` is 1 + the number of iterations where `t2 > t1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences (`max(t1, t2)`) for each iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: Remains a sorted list of integers, as the loop does not modify `a`.
- **`k`**: The loop iterates `len(a)` times, so after all iterations, `k` will be `len(a) - 1`.
- **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 each time `t2 <= t1`. Therefore, `i` will be the total number of iterations where `t2` was less than or equal to `t1`.
- **`j`**: This variable is incremented by 1 each time `t2 > t1`. Therefore, `j` will be 1 plus the total number of iterations where `t2` was greater than `t1`.
- **`ans`**: This variable accumulates the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration. After all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of these maximum values.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, `_`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
