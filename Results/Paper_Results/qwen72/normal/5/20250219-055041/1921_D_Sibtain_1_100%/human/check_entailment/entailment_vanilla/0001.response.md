### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of the arrays `a` and `c` respectively.
   - It then reads the elements of `a` and `c`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal. If so, it prints `0` because the difference will be zero.
   - This is a valid check and handles the edge case correctly.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order and the array `c` in descending order.
   - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order helps in maximizing the absolute differences between corresponding elements.

4. **Single Element Case:**
   - If `a` has only one element, the program calculates the maximum difference between this element and any element in `c`.
   - This is correct because the maximum difference for a single element is the maximum of the absolute differences with the largest and smallest elements in `c`.

5. **General Case:**
   - The program initializes indices `i` and `j` to 0 and 1 respectively, and an answer variable `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through the elements of `a` and for each element, it calculates two potential differences:
     - `t1` is the absolute difference between the current element in `a` and the corresponding element in `c` at index `i`.
     - `t2` is the absolute difference between the current element in `a` and the corresponding element in `c` at index `len(c) - j`.
   - It then updates the indices `i` and `j` based on which difference is larger and adds the larger difference to `ans`.
   - This approach ensures that the maximum possible difference is considered at each step.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated maximum difference `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the special case where all elements in both arrays are the same.
- The sorting and index manipulation logic is designed to maximize the total difference, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
- The program correctly calculates the maximum difference for the single element case.
- The general case logic ensures that the maximum possible differences are considered at each step.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
