Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. If `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.***
