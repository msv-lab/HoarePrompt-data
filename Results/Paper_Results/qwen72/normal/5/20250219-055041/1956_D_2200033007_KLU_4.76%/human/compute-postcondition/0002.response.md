The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(f'4 1')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state specifies that `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 18` and each element `a_i` in `c` satisfies `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`.
- The list `c` is explicitly given as `[2]`.
- The variable `m` is initialized to `0`.

### Task:
- The `print` statement is a formatted string that directly prints the values `4` and `1` without any reference to the variables or objects in the initial state.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `4 1` exactly as it is written in the code.
Output: **4 1**
