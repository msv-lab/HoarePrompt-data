The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a formatted string with the values "1" and "2". 

- The variable `c` is a list of integers with a length of 1, and its only element is 2.
- The variable `m` is 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement explicitly outputs the string "1 2".

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `c` or `m`, it will print the string "1 2" as is.

Output: **1 2**
