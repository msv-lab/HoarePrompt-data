Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` only handles the case where the length of the array `c` is 2, and it always prints `4 1` followed by `1 2`. For any other length of the array, it prints `13 0` and does not perform any operations. This is incorrect because the problem requires the program to maximize the sum of the elements of the array for any given input, and the solution provided does not achieve this for arrays of lengths other than 2.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
13 0
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
This shows that the program does not correctly handle the case where the array length is 4. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
