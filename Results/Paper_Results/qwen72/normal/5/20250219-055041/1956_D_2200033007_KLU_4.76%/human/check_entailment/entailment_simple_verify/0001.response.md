Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values. It reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the array. It then reads the array elements as a string, splits them, and appends them to the list `a`. However, the elements are appended as strings, not integers. This is a significant issue because the operations will require integer arithmetic, and the current implementation will not work correctly with string elements.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is incorrect because the function `func_1` should be called with the array `a` itself, not its length. The function `func_1` is designed to operate on the array, not just its length.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` has a conditional check for the length of the array `c`:
     - If `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`. This is correct for the specific case where the array has two elements, and the MEX of the set `{0, 1}` is 2. Setting both elements to 2 results in a sum of 4.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints `13 0`. This is incorrect because it assumes the maximum sum is always 13 and no operations are needed, which is not true for all arrays of length greater than 2. The maximum sum and the sequence of operations depend on the actual values in the array.

4. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not implement a general solution to find the MEX of a subarray and apply the operations to maximize the sum.
   - The logic is hardcoded for a specific case (array length of 2) and a specific output (array length greater than 2), which does not address the problem's requirements for all possible inputs.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct for the specific cases handled, but it is not correct for the general problem. The program should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case and does not compute the MEX or apply the operations to maximize the sum of the array. The issues with input handling and function call parameters further compound the problem.

Final: **False**
