Reasoning:

The annotated program provided does not correctly solve the given problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input array `a` correctly but then calls `func_1` with the length of the array `a` instead of the array itself. This is a mistake because the function `func_1` is supposed to operate on the array, not its length.

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` is designed to handle only two specific cases:
   - If the length of the array `c` is 2, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
   - Otherwise, it prints "13 0".

   This logic is incorrect because:
   - It does not consider the actual elements of the array.
   - It does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the operations described in the problem.
   - It does not maximize the sum of the array elements as required.

3. **Output**: The function does not provide a general solution for any input array. It only prints fixed outputs based on the length of the array, which is not sufficient to solve the problem for all valid inputs.

4. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `a` (`len(a)`), which is incorrect. The function should be called with the array `a` itself.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
