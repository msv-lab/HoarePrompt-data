### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Here are the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly and stores the array elements in the list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `c` (which is the same as `len(a)`).
   - The function only handles the case where the length of the array `c` is 2.
   - For any other length of the array, it prints `13 0` and does not perform any operations.

3. **Incorrect Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the elements of the array for any length other than 2.
   - For example, with the input:
     ```
     4
     1 100 2 1
     ```
     The program will output:
     ```
     13 0
     ```
     However, the correct output should be:
     ```
     105 2
     3 3
     3 4
     ```
   - This shows that the program does not correctly handle the case where the array length is 4, and it does not maximize the sum of the elements of the array.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary states that `func_1` prints either "4 1" followed by "1 2" if the list `c` contains exactly one element with the value 2, or "13 0" if the list `c` does not contain exactly one element with the value 2.
   - However, the function actually prints "4 1" followed by "1 2" if the length of the list `c` is 2, and "13 0" for any other length.
   - This discrepancy between the function summary and the actual behavior of the function further confirms the incorrectness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases and does not maximize the sum of the elements of the array for arrays of lengths other than 2.
