Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values correctly but does not convert them to integers. This can lead to incorrect operations and results.
2. **Function Definition and Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `a` but is not defined to handle the array itself. The function only handles specific cases for `c == 2` and otherwise prints a fixed output for `c != 2`, which is not a general solution.
3. **General Solution**: The function does not attempt to find the MEX of any subarray or perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. It only prints a fixed output for `c == 2` and `c != 2`, which is incorrect for most inputs.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Compute the MEX of subarrays.
- Perform operations to maximize the sum of the array.
- Output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex(arr):
    seen = set(arr)
    mex = 0
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def maximize_sum(a):
    n = len(a)
    operations = []
    total_sum = sum(a)
    
    # Try to maximize the sum by applying the operation
    for l in range(n):
        for r in range(l, n):
            subarray = a[l:r+1]
            x = mex(subarray)
            new_sum = total_sum - sum(subarray) + (r - l + 1) * x
            if new_sum > total_sum:
                total_sum = new_sum
                operations.append((l + 1, r + 1))
                for i in range(l, r + 1):
                    a[i] = x
    
    print(total_sum, len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])

# Read input
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Solve the problem
maximize_sum(a)
```

This program:
1. Correctly reads the input and converts the array elements to integers.
2. Defines a function `mex` to compute the MEX of a subarray.
3. Defines a function `maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array by applying the operation and tracking the operations.
4. Outputs the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
