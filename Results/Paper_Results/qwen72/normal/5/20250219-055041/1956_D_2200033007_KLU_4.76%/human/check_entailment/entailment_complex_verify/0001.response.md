Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values. It first reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the array. Then, it reads the array elements as a string, splits them, and appends them to the list `a`. However, the elements are appended as strings, not integers, which is a significant issue since the operations will require integer arithmetic. This part of the original assessment is accurate.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is correct in terms of function invocation. However, the function `func_1` is not designed to handle the actual array but rather just its length. This part of the original assessment is also accurate.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` has a conditional check for the length of the array `c`:
     - If `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`. This is correct for the specific case where the array has two elements, and the MEX of the set `{0, 1}` is 2. Setting both elements to 2 results in a sum of 4.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints `13 0`. This is incorrect because it assumes the maximum sum is always 13 and no operations are needed, which is not true for all arrays of length greater than 2. The maximum sum and the sequence of operations depend on the actual values in the array. The original assessment correctly identifies this as a flaw.

4. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not implement a general solution to find the MEX of a subarray and apply the operations to maximize the sum. The logic is hardcoded for a specific case (array length of 2) and a specific output (array length greater than 2), which does not address the problem's requirements for all possible inputs. The original assessment is correct in noting that the program lacks a general solution.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct for the specific cases handled, but it is not correct for the general problem. The program should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not handle the general output format.

Given these points, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the general case and does not compute the MEX or apply the operations to maximize the sum of the array. The original assessment accurately identifies the program's flaws and lack of a general solution.

Final: **False**
