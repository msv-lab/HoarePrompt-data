Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`. If `curr` is 0, the condition `curr == 0` holds true. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.***
