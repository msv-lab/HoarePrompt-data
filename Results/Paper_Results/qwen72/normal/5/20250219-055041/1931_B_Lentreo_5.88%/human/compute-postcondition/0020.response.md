Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder and not used.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `last` is the last element of `nums`.
- `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`.
- `curr` is not equal to 0.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
