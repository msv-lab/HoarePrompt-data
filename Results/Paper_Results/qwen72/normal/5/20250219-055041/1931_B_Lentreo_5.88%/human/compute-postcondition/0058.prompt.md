Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, and `curr` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in nums:
    if i != 0:
        curr += i - last


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least one element, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `i` is the first element of `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is set to `i - last`. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least two elements, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `i` is the second element of `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `i - last` plus its previous value. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least three elements, `last` is the second element of the `nums` list, `i` is the third element of `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
