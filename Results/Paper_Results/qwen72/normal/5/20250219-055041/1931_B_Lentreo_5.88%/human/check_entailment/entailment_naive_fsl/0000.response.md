Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
5
4 5 2 1 3
```

For the first test case:
- `n = 3`
- `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
- The program will set `last = 3` and `curr = 0`.
- It will then iterate through `nums`:
  - For `i = 1`, `curr += 1 - 3 = -2`
  - For `i = 2`, `curr += 2 - 3 = -1`
  - For `i = 3`, `curr += 3 - 3 = 0`
- The final value of `curr` will be `-3`, which is not `0`, so the program will print `NO`.

However, the correct answer should be `YES` because the sum of the elements is `6`, which is divisible by `3`, and we can make all elements equal to `2` by pouring `1` unit from the third container to the first container.

For the second test case:
- `n = 5`
- `nums = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`
- The program will set `last = 3` and `curr = 0`.
- It will then iterate through `nums`:
  - For `i = 4`, `curr += 4 - 3 = 1`
  - For `i = 5`, `curr += 5 - 3 = 2`
  - For `i = 2`, `curr += 2 - 3 = -1`
  - For `i = 1`, `curr += 1 - 3 = -2`
  - For `i = 3`, `curr += 3 - 3 = 0`
- The final value of `curr` will be `0`, so the program will print `YES`.

However, the correct answer should be `YES` because the sum of the elements is `15`, which is divisible by `5`, and we can make all elements equal to `3` by performing the operations as described in the problem statement.

The program incorrectly checks if the difference between each element and the last element sums to zero, which is not the correct approach to determine if all elements can be made equal. The correct approach would be to check if the sum of the elements is divisible by `n` and if the elements can be redistributed to make all elements equal to the average value. The provided program does not handle this logic correctly.
