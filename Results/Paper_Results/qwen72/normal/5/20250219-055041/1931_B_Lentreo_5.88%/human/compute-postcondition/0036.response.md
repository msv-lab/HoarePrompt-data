Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `i` is the third element in `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is increased by the value of `i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.***
