Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, and `curr` is the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`. If `curr` is 0, the program prints 'YES'. If `curr` is not 0, the program prints 'NO'.**

Natural language description:
- The loop has completed all `t` iterations, so `t` is now 0.
- The placeholder `_` is not used and remains a placeholder.
- For each iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `last` is the last element of the `nums` list for each iteration.
- `curr` is calculated as the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums` for each iteration.
- If `curr` is 0 for any iteration, the program prints 'YES'. If `curr` is not 0, the program prints 'NO'.
- The state of the variables `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` is determined for each iteration and remains unchanged for the next iteration, but the values of these variables will be different for each iteration based on the user input.
