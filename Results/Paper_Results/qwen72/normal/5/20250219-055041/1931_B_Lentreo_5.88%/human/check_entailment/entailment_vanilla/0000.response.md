Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` containers, each with an initial amount of water `a_i`.
   - We can pour any amount of water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the described operation.
   - The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, which means the target amount of water in each container is `sum(a_i) / n`.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - Since the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is an integer.
   - To achieve the target amount in each container, we need to ensure that the water can be redistributed such that each container ends up with the target amount.
   - The operation allows us to pour water from any container to any other container to the right of it. This means we can only move water from left to right.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program attempts to solve the problem by comparing each element in the list `nums` with the last element `last`.
   - It calculates a cumulative difference `curr` between each non-zero element and `last`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly determine if the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - The target amount of water in each container should be `sum(nums) // n`, not `last`.
   - The program does not check if the water can be redistributed to the target amount using the allowed operations.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the target amount of water `target = sum(nums) // n`.
   - Check if it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have `target` units of water.
   - A key observation is that if the water can be redistributed, the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount should be zero at the end of the process.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the third test case `a = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`:
     - The target amount is `sum([4, 5, 2, 1, 3]) // 5 = 15 // 5 = 3`.
     - We can redistribute the water as follows:
       - Pour 1 unit from the first container to the fourth: `[3, 5, 2, 2, 3]`.
       - Pour 1 unit from the second container to the third: `[3, 4, 3, 2, 3]`.
       - Pour 1 unit from the second container to the fourth: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
     - The program should output 'YES' for this case, but it does not because it uses the wrong logic.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the water can be redistributed to the target amount.

Correctness: **False**
