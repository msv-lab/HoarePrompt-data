### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation (pouring water from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index). The key insight is that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, which means that if we can redistribute the water, each container should end up with the average amount of water.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `last` Variable**:
   - The program sets `last` to the last element of the `nums` list.
   - It then calculates `curr` as the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and `last`.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not consider the average amount of water that each container should have. Instead, it compares each element to the last element, which is not the correct way to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Equal Distribution**:
   - The program checks if `curr` is zero to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.
   - This check is incorrect because `curr` being zero does not necessarily mean that the water can be evenly distributed. For example, if the last element is 0 and all other elements are non-zero, `curr` will not be zero even if the water can be evenly distributed.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the average amount of water that each container should have.
2. Check if it is possible to redistribute the water such that each container ends up with this average amount.

The correct logic would be:
- Calculate the average amount of water per container.
- Check if the water can be redistributed by ensuring that the total amount of water that needs to be poured out (from containers with more than the average) equals the total amount of water that needs to be poured in (to containers with less than the average).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
