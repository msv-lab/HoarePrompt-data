Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 3 elements, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `i` is the third element in `nums`, `curr` is increased by the value of `i - last`.**

In natural language, the value of `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the third element of the `nums` list (`i`) and the last element of the `nums` list (`last`). All other variables remain unchanged.
