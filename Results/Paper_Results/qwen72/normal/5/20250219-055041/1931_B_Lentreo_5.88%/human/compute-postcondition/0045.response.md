Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, and `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`. If `curr` is 0, the current value of `curr` remains 0. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` updates the `nums` list with new values provided by the user input.
- The initial state mentions that `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, which is now updated.
- The value of `last` is still the last element of the `nums` list.
- The value of `curr` is still the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `curr` (whether it is 0 or not) still holds based on the new values in `nums`.
