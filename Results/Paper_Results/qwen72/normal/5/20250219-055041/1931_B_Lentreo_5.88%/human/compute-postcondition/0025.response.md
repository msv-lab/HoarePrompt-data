Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in the `nums` list. If `curr` is 0, the condition `curr == 0` holds true. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `last = nums[-1]` assigns the last element of the `nums` list to the variable `last`.
- The value of `last` is now the last element of the `nums` list.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, `curr`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `curr == 0` still holds true if `curr` is 0, and `curr` is not equal to 0 otherwise.
