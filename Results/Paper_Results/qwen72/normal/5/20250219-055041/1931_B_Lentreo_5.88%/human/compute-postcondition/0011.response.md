Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least 2 elements, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is the second element of `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is now `i - last + (i - last)`. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to its current value.
- If `i` is not 0, the initial value of `curr` was `i - last`, so after the update, `curr` becomes `i - last + (i - last)`.
- If `i` is 0, `curr` remains 0.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i` remain unchanged.
