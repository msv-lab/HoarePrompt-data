Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` expects `start` and `end` to be integers where `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The current working directory should contain subfolders, and the names of these subfolders should be convertible to integers. The subfolders may contain files, and the function will specifically look for files with a `.html` extension. `t` is an integer provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2:
        print('NO')
    elif cnt1 == 1:
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the condition for `cnt1` remains unchanged. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, the condition for `cnt1` remains unchanged. If `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2, the condition for `cnt1` remains unchanged, and `cnt1` is either 1 (which is odd) or less than or equal to 2. The condition for `cnt1` remains unchanged if `s` contains the substring '11' or does not contain it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`, and `_` is 1. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` % 2 == 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`, and `_` is 2. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` % 2 == 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `cnt1` is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. In all other cases, the state of the variables also remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
