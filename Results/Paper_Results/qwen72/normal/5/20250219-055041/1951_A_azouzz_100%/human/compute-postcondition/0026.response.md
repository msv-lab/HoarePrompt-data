The code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`, and `_`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the initial state.

Output: **YES**
