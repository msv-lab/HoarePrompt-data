The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`. Both `start` and `end` are integers, with `start` being less than or equal to `end`. The function expects the current working directory to contain subfolders, and the names of these subfolders should be convertible to integers. The function will look for `.html` files within the subfolders whose names fall within the range specified by `start` and `end`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, `start` and `end`, and returns a list of `.html` files found in subfolders whose names are integers within the range `[start, end]`.**
