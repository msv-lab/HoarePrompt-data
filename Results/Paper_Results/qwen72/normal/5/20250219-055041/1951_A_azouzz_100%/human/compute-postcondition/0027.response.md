The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`, and `_`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
