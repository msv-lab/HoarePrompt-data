The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`, and `_`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string 'YES' that is passed to the `print` function.

Output: **YES**
