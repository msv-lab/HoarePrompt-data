The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n - 1)` will only execute if `n - 1` is greater than 1, which means `n` must be greater than 2. Given the initial state, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, which already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

However, for the loop to start, `i` must be set to 1, which is the first value in the range `1` to `n - 1`.

State: **list is a list of non-negative integers of length n, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 1**
