Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` must be greater than 0, `list[4]` must be greater than 1, `list[5]` is now `list[5] - list[3]`, `list[4]` is now `list[4] - 2 * list[3]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` is executed, where `i` is 4. This means `list[4]` is updated to `list[4] - 2 * list[3]`. The other conditions and values in the initial state remain unchanged.
