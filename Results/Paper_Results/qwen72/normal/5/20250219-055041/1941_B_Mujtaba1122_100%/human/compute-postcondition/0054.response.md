Output State: **The list is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is `n-1`, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, and for all `j` in the range `2` to `n-2`, `list[j]` is 0. The value of `list[n-1]` is the original value of `list[n-1]` minus the sum of all the values that were originally in `list[2]` to `list[n-2]` multiplied by 1, and `list[n-2]` is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list will have the following properties:
- The first two elements (`list[0]` and `list[1]`) are 0.
- All elements from `list[2]` to `list[n-2]` are 0.
- The last element (`list[n-1]`) will be the original value of `list[n-1]` minus the sum of the original values of `list[2]` to `list[n-2]`.
- The loop index `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
- The loop will not have printed 'no' and will not have returned early, meaning that the condition `list[i - 1] != 0` was never met during the execution of the loop.
