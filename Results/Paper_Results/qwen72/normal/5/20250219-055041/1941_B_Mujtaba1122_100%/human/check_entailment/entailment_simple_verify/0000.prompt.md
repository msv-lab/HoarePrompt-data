You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    3
    
    7 1 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not ensure that all elements of the array can be reduced to zero in a way that is consistent with the problem's operation rules.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The expected output is "YES" because it is possible to reduce all elements to zero using the described operations. However, the program does not correctly handle this case.

### Why the Program Fails:
1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The program attempts to reduce the elements by using the values of `list[i-1]` as the decrement factor, which is not consistent with the problem's operation rules. The operation should decrement `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the program incorrectly multiplies these decrements by `list[i-1]`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array elements are not in a form that allows the operation to be applied successfully. For example, if the array has elements that are not divisible by the required decrements, the program will not correctly determine if it is possible to reduce all elements to zero.

3. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The program can potentially enter an infinite loop if the conditions inside the `while` loop are not properly managed. For example, if `list[i]` is not sufficiently large to allow the operation to be applied, the loop may never terminate.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to ensure that the sum of the elements at even indices and the sum of the elements at odd indices are equal. This is because each operation affects one even-indexed element and two odd-indexed elements (or vice versa), and the total reduction must be balanced between even and odd indices.

A correct implementation would look something like this:
```python
def can_make_zero(arr, n):
    even_sum = sum(arr[i] for i in range(0, n, 2))
    odd_sum = sum(arr[i] for i in range(1, n, 2))
    return even_sum == odd_sum

def solve(t, test_cases):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        arr = test_cases[_][1]
        if can_make_zero(arr, n):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

solve(t, test_cases)
```

This approach correctly checks if the sum of elements at even indices is equal to the sum of elements at odd indices, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the array to be reducible to zero using the given operations.
