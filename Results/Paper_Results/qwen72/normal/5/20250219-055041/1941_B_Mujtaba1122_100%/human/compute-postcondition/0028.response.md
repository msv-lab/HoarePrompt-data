Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` must be greater than 0, `list[4]` must be greater than 1, `list[5]` must be greater than 0, `list[5]` is now `list[5] - list[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` updates the value at index `i + 1` (which is `5` since `i` is `4`) by subtracting the value at index `i - 1` (which is `3` since `i` is `4`).
- The value of `list[5]` is now `list[5] - list[3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
