To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

1. `list[i] > 1`
2. `list[i - 1] > 0`
3. `list[i + 1] > 0`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5)
- `i` is 1
- `list[0]` is `list[0] - list[0]` (which means `list[0]` is 0)
- `list[1]` is `list[1] - 2 * list[0] - 2 * list[0]` (which simplifies to `list[1] - 0` or just `list[1]`)
- `list[2]` is `list[2] - 2 * list[0]` (which simplifies to `list[2] - 0` or just `list[2]`)

Now, let's check the conditions for the next iteration:
1. `list[i] > 1` → `list[1] > 1` (since `i` is 1)
2. `list[i - 1] > 0` → `list[0] > 0` (since `i - 1` is 0)
3. `list[i + 1] > 0` → `list[2] > 0` (since `i + 1` is 2)

From the given state:
- `list[0]` is 0, which does not satisfy `list[0] > 0`
- `list[1]` is `list[1]`, which must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute
- `list[2]` is `list[2]`, which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `list[0] > 0`. However, since we cannot modify `list[0]` directly (it's not in the loop head), we need to ensure that the conditions for `i = 1` are met. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.

Since `i` is 1, the next iteration will use `i = 2`. We need to ensure that:
1. `list[2] > 1`
2. `list[1] > 0`
3. `list[3] > 0`

Given that `list[2]` is `list[2]` and must be greater than 0, and `list[1]` must be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `list[2]` is greater than 1 and `list[3]` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to:
- `i` is 2
- `list[2]` must be greater than 1
- `list[3]` must be greater than 0

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 2, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is `list[1]`, `list[2]` must be greater than 1, `list[3]` must be greater than 0**
