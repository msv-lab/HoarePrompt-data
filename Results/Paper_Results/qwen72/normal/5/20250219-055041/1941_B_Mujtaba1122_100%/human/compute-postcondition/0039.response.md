Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (4 < n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is greater than 0, `list[4]` is greater than 1, `list[5]` is greater than 0, and `list[4]` is now `list[4] - 2 * list[3]` (which is still greater than 0).**
