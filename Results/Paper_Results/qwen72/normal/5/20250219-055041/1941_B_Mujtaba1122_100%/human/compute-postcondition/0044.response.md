Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (4 < n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is 0, `list[4]` is `list[4] - 2 * list[3]`, `list[5]` is `list[5] - list[3]`**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is executed.
- `i` is 4, so `i - 1` is 3.
- `list[3]` is greater than 0, and the code subtracts `list[3]` from itself, setting `list[3]` to 0.
- The values of `list[0]`, `list[1]`, `list[2]`, `list[4]`, and `list[5]` remain unchanged.
- The length of `list` and the value of `i` also remain unchanged.
