Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 1, `list[0]` is greater than 0, `list[1]` is greater than 1, `list[2]` is `list[2] - list[0]`**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the element at index `i + 1` (which is `2` since `i` is `1`) by subtracting the value of `list[i - 1]` (which is `list[0]`).
- Therefore, `list[2]` is updated to `list[2] - list[0]`.
- The values of `list[0]` and `list[1]` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains `1`.
- The length of `list` remains `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).
- The conditions that `list[0]` is greater than 0 and `list[1]` is greater than 1 still hold true.
