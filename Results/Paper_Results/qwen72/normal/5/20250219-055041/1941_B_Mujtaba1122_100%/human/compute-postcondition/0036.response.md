The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` is 4.
- `n` must still be such that `i < n - 1`, which means `4 < n - 1` or `n > 5`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (4 < n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is 0, `list[4]` is 0, and `list[5]` is `list[5] - list[3]`. Additionally, `list[i - 1]` is 0.**
