Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 2, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is `list[1]`, `list[2]` is `list[2] - 2 * list[1]`, `list[3]` is `list[3] - list[1]`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` updates the value of `list[2]` by subtracting `2 * list[1]` from it.
- Since `i` is 2, `list[2]` is updated to `list[2] - 2 * list[1]`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
  - `list` is still a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).
  - `i` is still 2.
  - `list[0]` is still 0.
  - `list[1]` remains the same.
  - `list[3]` is still `list[3] - list[1]`.
