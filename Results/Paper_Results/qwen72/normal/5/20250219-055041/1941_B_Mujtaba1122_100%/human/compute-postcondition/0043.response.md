Output State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (4 < n <= 2 * 10^5), `i` is 4, `list[0]` is 0, `list[1]` is 0, `list[2]` is 0, `list[3]` is greater than 0, `list[4]` is `list[4] - 2 * list[3]`, `list[5]` is `list[5] - list[3]`**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` affects the value of `list[4]` because `i` is 4.
- `list[4]` is updated by subtracting `2 * list[3]` from its current value.
- The value of `list[3]` is greater than 0, so `list[4]` becomes `list[4] - 2 * list[3]`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
