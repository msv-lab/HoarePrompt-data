The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ch` and the string `password`. The loop iterates over each character in the `password` string, and the state of `ch` changes to the next character in the string at the start of each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20
- `password` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits
- `ch` is the second character of `password`
- If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first and second characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list
- If `ch` is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password` and `ch`, and `digits` is an empty list

For the loop to execute one more time, `ch` must be adjusted to the third character of `password`, and the loop will continue as long as there are more characters in `password`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the third character of `password`. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first and second characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list. If `ch` is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password` and the second character of `password`, and `digits` is an empty list.**
