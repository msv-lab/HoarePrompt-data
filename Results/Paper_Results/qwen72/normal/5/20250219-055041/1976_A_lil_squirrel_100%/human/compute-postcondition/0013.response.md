Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the third character of `password`, `digits` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list.** 

The code `digits.append(ch)` adds the third character of `password` to the list `digits`. Since `ch` is a digit, `digits` now contains the first, second, and third characters of `password`. The list `letters` remains empty. The values of `n` and `password` are unchanged.
