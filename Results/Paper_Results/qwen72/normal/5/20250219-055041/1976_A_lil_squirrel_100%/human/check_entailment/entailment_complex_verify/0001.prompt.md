You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`. Additionally, `letters` is sorted.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`. Additionally, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`. Additionally, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted, and `n` must be at least 2. The loop has completed all iterations, and there is no position `i` in `password` such that `password[i]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20 and `password` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits). It returns 'NO' if any of the following conditions are met: the letters in `password` are not in non-decreasing order, the digits in `password` are not in non-decreasing order, or there is a lowercase letter followed immediately by a digit. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Separation of Characters:**
   - The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.
   - This is done using a loop that checks if each character is a digit or a letter and appends it to the respective list.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(letters)`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(digits)`.
   - If either list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'.

4. **Order Check:**
   - The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking if the current character is a letter and the next character is a digit.
   - If such a pair is found, the function returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Return:**
   - If all the checks pass, the function returns 'YES'.

### Analysis of the Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Password: `12ac`
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2']` (sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Password: `123wa`
  - Letters: `['a', 'w']` (not sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Password: `allllmost`
  - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `[]` (empty, trivially sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Password: `ac123`
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Digit '1' comes after a letter 'c'.
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Password: `011679`
  - Letters: `[]` (empty, trivially sorted)
  - Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
  - No letter comes before a digit.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. It separates the characters, checks the sorting of letters and digits, and ensures that no digit comes after a letter. The program produces the correct output for all the given test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
