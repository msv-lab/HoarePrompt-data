To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(len(password) - 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `password`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(password) - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.
   - `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`.
   - `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - The character at position `i + 1` in `password` is not a lowercase Latin letter, or the character at position `i + 2` in `password` is not a digit.
   - If `password[i]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.

2. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `len(password) - 1`.

3. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `len(password)` remains `n`, and `n` must be at least 2.
   - The loop will execute again if `i + 1` is less than `n`.

### Final State:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`. Additionally, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted, and `n` must be at least 2. The character at position `i + 2` in `password` is not a lowercase Latin letter, or the character at position `i + 3` in `password` is not a digit. If `password[i + 1]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 2]` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1. `i` is `i + 1` and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
