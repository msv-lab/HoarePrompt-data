Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20 and `password` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits). It returns 'NO' if any of the following conditions are met: the letters in `password` are not in non-decreasing order, the digits in `password` are not in non-decreasing order, or there is a lowercase letter followed immediately by a digit. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'. **
