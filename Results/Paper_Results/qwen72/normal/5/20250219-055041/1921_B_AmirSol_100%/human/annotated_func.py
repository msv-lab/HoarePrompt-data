#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing the initial and desired positions of cats in the boxes, respectively.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0')
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    #The program returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, where `cats_to_add` is the number of positions where '0' in `s1` corresponds to '1' in `s2`, and `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where '1' in `s1` corresponds to '0' in `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `s1` (a string of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters), and `s2` (another string of the same length consisting of '0' and '1' characters). It returns the maximum number of changes required to transform the initial positions of cats (`s1`) into the desired positions of cats (`s2`). These changes can be either adding a cat (changing '0' to '1') or removing a cat (changing '1' to '0').
