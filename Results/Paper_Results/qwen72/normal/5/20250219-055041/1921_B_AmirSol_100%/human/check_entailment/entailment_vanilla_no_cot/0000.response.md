Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`). Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s1`, and the desired state `s2`.

2. **Calculating Operations**:
   - `cats_to_add` counts the number of positions where a cat needs to be added (i.e., `s1[i] == '0'` and `s2[i] == '1'`).
   - `cats_to_remove` counts the number of positions where a cat needs to be removed (i.e., `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`).

3. **Returning the Result**: The function returns the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`. This is correct because:
   - If there are more cats to add than to remove, the number of days required will be the number of cats to add.
   - If there are more cats to remove than to add, the number of days required will be the number of cats to remove.
   - If the number of cats to add and remove is the same, the number of days required will be that number.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is calculated correctly for each test case. The program also handles the constraints and input format as specified in the problem description.
