Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to it, `_` is `m - 1`, `a3` is the first integer from the new new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new new input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a new line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to `l3`.
- The values of `a3` and `l3` are updated based on this new input.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
