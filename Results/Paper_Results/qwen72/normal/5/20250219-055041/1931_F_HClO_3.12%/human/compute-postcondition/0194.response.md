Postcondition: ***`a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is 2, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `_` is `m - 2`, and all inputs have been consumed. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither of these conditions is met, the program continues without breaking.***
