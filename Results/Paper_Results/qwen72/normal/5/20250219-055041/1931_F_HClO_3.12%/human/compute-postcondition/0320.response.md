The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. Since `idx1` is -1, it means the value `a2` will be inserted at the second-to-last position of the list `l2`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is less than `idx2`. `a2` has been inserted into `l2` at the second-to-last position.**
