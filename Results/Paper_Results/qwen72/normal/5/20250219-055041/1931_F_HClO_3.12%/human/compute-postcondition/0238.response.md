The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the string `'no'`. The initial state describes the list `val` containing at least one tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`, and it mentions that `a3` and `l3` are set to the values of the next tuple in `val`. However, the `print` statement does not use these variables or the list `val` in any way.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and independent of the initial state.

Output: **no**
