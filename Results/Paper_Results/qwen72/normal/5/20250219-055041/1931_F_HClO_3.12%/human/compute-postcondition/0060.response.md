To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Given State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` are input integers
- `a1` is the first integer from the input
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input
- `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n - 2` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must be less than `n - 1`, which simplifies to `i < n - 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1` (which simplifies to `i < n - 2`)**.
