Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2` based on the initial condition. If `idx1` > `idx2`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at index -1 and `l` is equal to `l1`. Otherwise, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers input, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `m` is decreased by 1.***
