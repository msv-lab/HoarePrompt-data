Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `_` is incremented by 1, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input.**

Explanation:
- The line `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts, and converts each part to an integer.
- The first integer is assigned to `a3`.
- The remaining integers are collected into a list `l3`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, `l`, `m`, `_`) remain unchanged, but `_` is incremented by 1.
