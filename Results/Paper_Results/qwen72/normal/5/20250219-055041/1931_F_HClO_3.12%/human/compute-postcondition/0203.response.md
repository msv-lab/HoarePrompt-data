Output State: **`a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists, `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists, `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `_` is 1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `_` is `m - 2`, and all inputs have been consumed. Additionally, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the index `idx2`.
- The value of `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists.
- The list `l1` is updated to include `a1` at the specified index `idx2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
