Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 1. If `m` is 1, all the above conditions are retained. If `l11` is not equal to `l22` and `m` is greater than 1, `_` is set to `m - 2` and all inputs have been consumed, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is 0, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `_` is `m - 2` and all inputs have been consumed, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Additionally, if `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then the current values of `l1[i + p1]` and `l2[i + p2]` are different, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a1` or `a2`. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is 0, `p1` is 1, and `p2` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is -1, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 1. In both cases, if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, the `break` statement has been executed, so we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `_` is `m - 2`, and all inputs have been consumed. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is 2, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `_` is `m - 2`, and all inputs have been consumed. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither of these conditions is met, the program continues without breaking.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
