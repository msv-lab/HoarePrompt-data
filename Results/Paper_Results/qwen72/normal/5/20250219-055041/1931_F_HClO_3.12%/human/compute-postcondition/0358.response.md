The only objects in the loop head are `a3` and `l3`, which are derived from the list `val`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more tuples in `val` to iterate over. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `val` must contain at least 1 tuple, and `a3` and `l3` are set to the values from the first tuple in `val`. For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must contain at least 2 tuples, and `a3` and `l3` will be set to the values from the second tuple in `val`.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` must contain at least 2 tuples, `a3` is the integer from the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of integers from the second tuple in `val`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding the integer `a3`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
