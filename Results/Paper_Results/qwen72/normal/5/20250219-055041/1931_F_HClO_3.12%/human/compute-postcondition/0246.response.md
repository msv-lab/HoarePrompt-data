The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a counter in the `range(t)` loop. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, and the loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`, we need to adjust `_` to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `val` is a list containing at least `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`.
- If any `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the loop breaks and prints 'no'.
- Otherwise, the loop completes and prints 'yes'.
- The values of `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `n`, `m`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `_` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`val` is a list containing at least `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, if any `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the loop breaks and prints 'no', otherwise, the loop completes and prints 'yes', `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `n`, `m`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` remain unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`**
