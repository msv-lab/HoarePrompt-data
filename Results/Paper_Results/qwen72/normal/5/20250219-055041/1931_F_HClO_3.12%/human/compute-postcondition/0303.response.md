The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 1.
- The sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `n - 1` is greater than 1, and thus `i` being 2 is still less than `n - 1` as long as `n` is greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2**
