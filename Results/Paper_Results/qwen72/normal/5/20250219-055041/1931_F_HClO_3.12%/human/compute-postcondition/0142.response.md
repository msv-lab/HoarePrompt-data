Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a2` is the first integer from the second input.
   - `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input.
   - `a1` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`.
   - `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
   - `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1.
   - `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input.
   - `_` is `m - 2`.
   - All inputs have been consumed.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('no')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'no'`.
   - The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and lists, but none of these variables or lists are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
