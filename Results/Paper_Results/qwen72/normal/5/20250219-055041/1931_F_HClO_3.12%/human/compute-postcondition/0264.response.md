The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of the loop.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `_` is `m - 3`, `t` must be greater than `m - 3`, and the program has received user input `m - 2` times. The current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
