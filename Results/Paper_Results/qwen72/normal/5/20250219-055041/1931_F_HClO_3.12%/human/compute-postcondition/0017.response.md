The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the integer `m`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `m - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `m` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `m` must be greater than 2, which remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2**
