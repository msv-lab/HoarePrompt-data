The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other details about `n`, `k`, and the arrays `a_{ij}` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted in this context.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
