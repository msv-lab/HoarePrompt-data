Postcondition: **`a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is 0, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `_` is `m - 2` and all inputs have been consumed, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Additionally, if `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is 0, `p1` is 1, and `p2` is 0. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 1. In both cases, the current values of `l1[i + p1]` and `l2[i + p2]` are different, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a1` or `a2`. Furthermore, `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0, and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0.**
