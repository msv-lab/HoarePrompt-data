Output State: **`a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists, `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists, `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `_` is `m - 2`, and all inputs have been consumed.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, so the loop variable `i` is now `n - 1`.
- `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the indices where `l1` and `l2` first encounter elements equal to `a2` and `a1`, respectively. If no such elements are found, they remain -1.
- `p1` and `p2` are flags indicating whether `l1` or `l2` encountered an element equal to `a2` or `a1` before the other list. If `l1` encounters `a2` first, `p1` is set to 1; otherwise, it remains 0. Similarly, if `l2` encounters `a1` first, `p2` is set to 1; otherwise, it remains 0.
- The other variables (`a2`, `l2`, `a1`, `l1`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `l11`, `l22`, `val`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial states, as they are not modified within the loop.
