Output State: **`a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is the index where `l1[i + p1]` first equals `a2` or -1 if no such index exists, `idx2` is the index where `l2[i + p2]` first equals `a1` or -1 if no such index exists, `p1` is 1 if `l1` contains an element equal to `a2` before `l2` contains an element equal to `a1`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l2` contains an element equal to `a1` before `l1` contains an element equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `_` is 1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `_` is `m - 2`, and all inputs have been consumed. Additionally, `idx1` is less than `idx2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the index `idx1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- The list `l2` now includes `a2` at the position `idx1`, and the rest of the list remains the same.
- The condition `idx1` is less than `idx2` still holds true.
- The value of `p1` and `p2` are not affected by this insertion.
- The value of `val` remains an empty list.
- The value of `_` remains as defined: 1 if `m` is 1, otherwise `m - 2`.
- The values of `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` are unchanged except for the modification to `l2`.
