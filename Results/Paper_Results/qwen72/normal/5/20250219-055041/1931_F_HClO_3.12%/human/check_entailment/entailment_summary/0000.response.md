### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.

2. **Single Screenshot Case:**
   - If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the program correctly prints 'yes' because a single screenshot always corresponds to a valid order.

3. **Multiple Screenshots Case:**
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and extracts the lists of participants excluding the authors.
   - It then checks if these two lists are identical after removing the authors. If they are not, it prints 'no' and continues to the next test case.
   - If the lists are identical, it attempts to find the correct positions to insert the authors into the lists to make them consistent.
   - The program uses indices `idx1` and `idx2` to track the positions where the authors should be inserted.
   - It then checks the relative positions of the authors in the lists and inserts them accordingly.
   - For the remaining screenshots, it reads each one and checks if the list of participants (excluding the author) matches the constructed consistent list. If any do not match, it prints 'no'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `m == 2` by directly comparing the lists and determining the correct order.
   - It also handles the case where the lists are already consistent by default.

5. **Consistency Check:**
   - The program ensures that the constructed consistent list matches the lists from the remaining screenshots by comparing them after removing the authors.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem description and the provided test cases. It checks for the consistency of the participant orders across all screenshots and prints the appropriate results.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
