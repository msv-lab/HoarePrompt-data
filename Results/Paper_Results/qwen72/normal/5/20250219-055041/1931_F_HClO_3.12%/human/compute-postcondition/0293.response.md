Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged. However, the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
