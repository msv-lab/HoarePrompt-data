Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, and if `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then: if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, `p1` is 1, and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `p2` is 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `i` remains 1 and no changes are made to `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, or `idx2`. If the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
