Output State: **`i` is 30, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[30]`, `j` is 32. For each bit position `k` from 0 to 31, if the `k`-th bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[k][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[k][0]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all 32 iterations:
- The variable `i` remains 30.
- The variable `n` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `cur` is still equal to `prefix[30]`.
- The variable `j` is now 32.
- For each bit position from 0 to 31 in the binary representation of `cur`, the corresponding entry in the `suf` array is updated. If the bit at position `k` is 1, `suf[k][1]` is incremented by 1. If the bit at position `k` is 0, `suf[k][0]` is incremented by 1.
