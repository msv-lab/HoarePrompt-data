The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the range `32`. The loop will execute 32 times, regardless of the state of `arr`, `n`, `prefix`, `pre`, or `suf`. The loop does not depend on the state of these variables to start or to determine the number of iterations. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, the range is 32**
