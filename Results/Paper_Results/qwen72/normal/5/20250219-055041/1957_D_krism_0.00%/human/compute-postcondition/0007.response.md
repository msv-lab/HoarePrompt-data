Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `v` is the second integer in `arr`, `n` is an input integer, `prefix` is a list containing the integers 0, the first integer in `arr`, and the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` (which is the XOR of the second integer in `arr` and the last element in `prefix` before the code execution).**
