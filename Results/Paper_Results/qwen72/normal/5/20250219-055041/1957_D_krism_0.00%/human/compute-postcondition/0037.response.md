Output State: **`i` is 31, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[31]`, `j` is 31. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all 32 iterations, the variable `i` remains 31, `n` is still greater than 0, and `cur` is still equal to `prefix[31]`. The loop variable `j` will be 31, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. For each bit position from 0 to 31 in the binary representation of `cur`, if the bit is 1, the corresponding `suf[j][1]` value is incremented by 1. If the bit is 0, the corresponding `suf[j][0]` value is incremented by 1. This process effectively counts the number of 1s and 0s at each bit position in `cur`.
