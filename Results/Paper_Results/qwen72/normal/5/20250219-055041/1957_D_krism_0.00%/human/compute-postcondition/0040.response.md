The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range specified by `range(32)`. The loop will execute regardless of the initial value of `j` because the range function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 31, and the loop will iterate over these values. However, to align with the loop head, the initial state of `j` should be adjusted to 0, as this is the starting point of the range specified in the loop.

State: **`i` is 30, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[30]`, `j` is 0**
