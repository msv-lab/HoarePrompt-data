The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range, which is a fixed value of 32. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` being less than 32. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and the range is 32. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. The range remains 32.

State: **`i` is 1, the range is 32, `pre[0][0]` is increased by 1.**
