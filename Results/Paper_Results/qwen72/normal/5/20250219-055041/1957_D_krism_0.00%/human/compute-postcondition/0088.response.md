Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is 31, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[0]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[0]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 0. If the least significant bit of `c` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. If the least significant bit of `c` is 0, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.***
