Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 31, `ans` is `3 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 3 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[2]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[2]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 31.**

Explanation:
- The code `c = prefix[i]` updates the value of `c` to `prefix[3]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`, `y`, `k`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
