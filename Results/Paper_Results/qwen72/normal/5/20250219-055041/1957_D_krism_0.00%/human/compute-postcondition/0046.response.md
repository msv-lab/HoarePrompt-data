The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range `32`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `32`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1.

State: **`i` is 30, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[30]`, `j` is 1**
