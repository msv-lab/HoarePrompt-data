Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 31, `ans` is 0, `y` is equal to `arr[0]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[0]` minus 1.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of the bit length of `y` minus 1. Since `y` is equal to `arr[0]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[0]` minus 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
