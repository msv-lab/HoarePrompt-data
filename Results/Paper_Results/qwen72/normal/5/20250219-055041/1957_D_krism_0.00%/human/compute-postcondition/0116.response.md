Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `ans` is `2 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 2 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[1]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[1]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1.** 

In natural language: The value of `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1, where `j` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `pre[j][1]` is now one more than it was before.
