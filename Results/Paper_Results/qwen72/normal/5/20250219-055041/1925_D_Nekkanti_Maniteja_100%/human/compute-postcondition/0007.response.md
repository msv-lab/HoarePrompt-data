Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is unspecified, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.** 

The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are assigned based on the input provided. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a` remain unchanged.
