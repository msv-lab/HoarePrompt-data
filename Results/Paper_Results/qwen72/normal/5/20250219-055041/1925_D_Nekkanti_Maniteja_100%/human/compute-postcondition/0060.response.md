The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `m` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`M` is 1000000007, `i` is 2, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k` and greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is 0, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the third input integer plus `f`.**
