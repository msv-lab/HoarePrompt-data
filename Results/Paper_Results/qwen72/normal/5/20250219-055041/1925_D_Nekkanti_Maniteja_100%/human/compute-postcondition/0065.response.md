Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `i` is 0, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is `c * a` (since `i` is 0, the term `c * i * c * m` becomes 0), `u` is the last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `v` is the second last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `f` is the third last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations.**
