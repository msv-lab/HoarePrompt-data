The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 to 1000 (inclusive). Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters, where `n` must be within the range 1 to 50 (inclusive). The string consists of characters '.', '@', or '*', and the first character of each string is always '.'. The function returns a list of results for each test case, where each result is based on the input tuple.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters starting with '.'. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the input tuples.**
