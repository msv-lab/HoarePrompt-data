Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list. `ret` is 0 if the first character is not '@', otherwise `ret` is 1. If the second character is '@', `ret` is 2. If the second character is '*', `thorn` is set to 1. If `i` (the third character) is '@', `ret` is 3. If `thorn` was 2 before the if-else block, it remains 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `thorn` was 0 before the if-else block, it remains 0 if the second character is not '*', and the condition `thorn == 0` remains true. If the second character is '*', `thorn` is set to 1, and the condition `thorn == 0` is no longer true.***
