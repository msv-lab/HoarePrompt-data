Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number`, `i` remains unchanged, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing the values of `size` and `i`, and the current value of `value` is less than or equal to `number`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `size`, `i`, `value`, and `size_overlap` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
