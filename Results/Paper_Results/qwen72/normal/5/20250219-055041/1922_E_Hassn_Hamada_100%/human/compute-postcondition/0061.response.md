Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that contains `[0, 1, 2, ..., size - 1]`, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `i` is `size - 1`, `overlap` is 0, `size - overlap` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `sequence` list will contain all integers from 0 up to `size - 1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `size - 1`, and the `overlap` variable remains undefined (or 0, as it was initially). The `number` and `size` variables retain their initial values, with `size` still being the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\). The loop will have run for `size` iterations, appending each integer from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence` list.
