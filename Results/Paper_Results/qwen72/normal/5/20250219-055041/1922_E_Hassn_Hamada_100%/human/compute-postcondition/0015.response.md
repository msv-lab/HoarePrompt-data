Output State: **`size` is increased by 1, and the condition \((1 << (size + 2)) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\) is still checked to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `size` is increased by 1, so the new value of `size` is the previous value plus 1.
- The condition \((1 << (size + 2)) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\) remains unchanged and is still checked.
- The variable `value` is assigned the result of the expression \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\), where `size` is the new value (previous value + 1) and `i` retains its original value.
