Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `size` is increased by 1, `value` is \((1 << \text{size}) - (1 << i)\)**

The value of `size` is incremented by 1, while the values of `number` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `value` is updated to \((1 << \text{size}) - (1 << i)\), reflecting the new value of `size`.
