Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly generate the required array that should have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is supposed to build the sequence by recursively finding the appropriate elements to add, but it fails to do so effectively. The function always returns `(0, 0)` and does not modify the `sequence` list as intended, which means the sequence is not being built correctly. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of increasing subsequences and appending the correct elements is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
