To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `size`, and `overlap`.

1. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will start from 0 and iterate up to `size - overlap - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the upper bound of the range must be greater than 0.
2. **`size`**: This is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\). This condition is given and should not be changed.
3. **`overlap`**: This variable is mentioned in the loop head but is not defined in the initial state. We need to determine what `overlap` should be to ensure the loop executes.

Given the loop:
```
for i in range(size - overlap):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `size - overlap > 0` must be true. This means `overlap` must be less than `size`.

Since `overlap` is not defined in the initial state, we need to define it in a way that ensures the loop will execute. The simplest and most straightforward way to do this is to set `overlap` to 0, which guarantees that `size - overlap` will be `size`, and since `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), it will be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\), `i` is 0, `overlap` is 0**
