Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing the values of `size` and `i` where `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\) and `i` is the largest integer in the range of the loop for which the condition `value <= number` is true.**

### Explanation:
- **`number`**: The value of `number` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`sequence`**: The value of `sequence` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`size_overlap`**: The loop will find the largest `i` in the range `[max(sequence, default=0), -1]` such that the value \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\) is less than or equal to `number`, where `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > \text{number}\). Once such an `i` and `size` are found, the loop breaks, and `size_overlap` is set to the tuple `(size, i)`.

The loop iterates from the maximum value in `sequence` (or 0 if `sequence` is empty) down to -1. For each `i`, it calculates `size` and `value` and checks if `value` is less than or equal to `number`. If it is, the loop breaks, and `size_overlap` is set to `(size, i)`. If no such `i` is found, `size_overlap` remains unchanged from its initial state of `(0, 0)`.
