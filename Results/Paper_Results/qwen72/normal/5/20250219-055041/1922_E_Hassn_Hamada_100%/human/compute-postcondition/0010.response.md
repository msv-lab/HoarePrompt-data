To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given program state:

The loop condition is:
```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
```

### Given Program State:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\)
- `size` is increased by 1
- `value` is \((1 << \text{size}) - (1 << i)\)

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as \((1 << \text{size} + 1) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\).
2. **Current State**:
   - `size` has been increased by 1.
   - `value` is \((1 << \text{size}) - (1 << i)\).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- The loop condition depends on `size` and `i`.
- After the previous iteration, `size` has been increased by 1.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if \((1 << \text{size} + 1) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\) still holds true.

### Adjustments:
- Since `size` is increased by 1, the next iteration will use \((1 << (\text{size} + 1) + 1) - (1 << i)\).
- This simplifies to \((1 << \text{size} + 2) - (1 << i)\).

### Ensuring the Loop Condition:
- For the loop to execute again, \((1 << \text{size} + 2) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\) must be true.
- Given that \((1 << \text{size} + 1) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\) was true at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that \((1 << \text{size} + 2) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\) is also true.

### Conclusion:
- The condition \((1 << \text{size} + 2) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\) must hold true for the loop to execute one more time.
- Since `size` is increased by 1, the new condition is \((1 << (\text{size} + 1) + 1) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\).

### Final State:
- The state of `number` and `i` remains the same.
- The state of `size` is increased by 1.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `size` is increased by 1, `value` is \((1 << \text{size}) - (1 << i)\)**
