Output State: **`size` is increased by 1, `number` must be at least `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)`, `i` is at least `0`, `(1 << i) <= number` is true, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`**

Explanation: The value of `size` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `number` and `i` are updated to reflect the new value of `size`. The condition `(1 << i) <= number` remains true, and the value of `value` is recalculated based on the new `size`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
