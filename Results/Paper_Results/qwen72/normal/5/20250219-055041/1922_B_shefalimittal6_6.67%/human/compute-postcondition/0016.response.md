Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is the value of the first entry in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` added to its previous value (which was 0). Otherwise, `res` remains 0.***
