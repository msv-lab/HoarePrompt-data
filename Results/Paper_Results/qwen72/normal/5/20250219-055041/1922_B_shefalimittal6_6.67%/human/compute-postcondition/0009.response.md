The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If `nums` has at least 3 integers, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` must have at least 2 integers, and `x` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least 3 integers, and `x` will be the third integer in the list.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 2, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list `nums`.**
