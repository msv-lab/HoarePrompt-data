The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in the list `nums`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` will be the second element in the list `nums`.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1 (if `x` was not in `num_of_lens` before) or incremented by 1 (if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`), `res` remains unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list `nums`.**
