Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is incremented by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by `total_sum`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.
- `math.comb(cnt, 2)` calculates the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `res` is the result of the original value of `res` plus the product of the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time and `total_sum`.
