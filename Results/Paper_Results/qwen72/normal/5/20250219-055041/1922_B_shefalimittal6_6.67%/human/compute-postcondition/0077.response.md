The only objects in the loop head are the list `nums` and the variable `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If `nums` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in the list `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least 3 elements, and `x` will be the third element in the list `nums`.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 3 (if `x` was not in `num_of_lens` before and is the same as the second element) or incremented by 1 (if `x` was already in `num_of_lens` and is different from the second element), `res` remains unchanged, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `nums`.**
