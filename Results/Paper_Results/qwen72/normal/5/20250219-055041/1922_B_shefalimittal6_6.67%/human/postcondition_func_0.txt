The function `func` reads multiple test cases from user input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the number of valid combinations of these integers based on specific conditions (combinations of counts taken 3 at a time for counts ≥ 3, and combinations of counts taken 2 at a time for counts ≥ 2, each multiplied by the sum of all other counts). Finally, it prints the result for each test case. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with counts of integers, `nums` is a list of integers, and the results of the calculations have been printed for each test case.
