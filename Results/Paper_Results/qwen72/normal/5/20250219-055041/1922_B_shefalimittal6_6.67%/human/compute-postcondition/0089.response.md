The only objects in the loop head are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least two key-value pairs, the loop can execute again for the second key-value pair.

At the end of the last iteration, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, and `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_of_lens` must have at least two key-value pairs, and `cnt` will be the second value in `num_of_lens`.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the second value in `num_of_lens`**
