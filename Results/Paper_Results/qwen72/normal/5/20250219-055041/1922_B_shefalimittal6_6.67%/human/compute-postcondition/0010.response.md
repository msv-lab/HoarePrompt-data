Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 3, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in the list `nums`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by incrementing it by 1.
- Initially, `num_of_lens[x]` is 2.
- After the code executes, `num_of_lens[x]` becomes 3.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
