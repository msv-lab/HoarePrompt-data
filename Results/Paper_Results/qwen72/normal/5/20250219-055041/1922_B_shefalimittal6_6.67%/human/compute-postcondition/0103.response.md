Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing the counts of integers in `nums` for each test case, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user for each test case, `res` is the sum of all combinations of counts taken 3 at a time for counts greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of all combinations of counts taken 2 at a time for counts greater than or equal to 2, each multiplied by the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens` for each test case.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has completed all `t` iterations. For each test case, the variable `n` will have been an input integer, and `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and the value is the count of that integer in `nums`. The list `nums` will have been the list of integers provided by the user for each test case. The variable `res` will hold the result for each test case, which is the sum of all combinations of counts taken 3 at a time for counts that are at least 3, plus the sum of all combinations of counts taken 2 at a time for counts that are at least 2, each multiplied by the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens`. This result will be printed for each test case.
