Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 0, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`.**

The initial state remains unchanged for `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `res`. The new variable `total_sum` is calculated as the sum of all values in the dictionary `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`. The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, but this does not affect the other variables or the calculation of `total_sum`.
