Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the input, which must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
