Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the third entry in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res` + `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.***
