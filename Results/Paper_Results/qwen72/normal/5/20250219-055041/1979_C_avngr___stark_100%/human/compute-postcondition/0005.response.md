The only objects in the loop head are the list `numbers` and the variable `num`. The loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of the list `numbers` and goes to the end. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `numbers`, and `result` is the new result of `func_1(result, num)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must have at least 4 elements. The variable `num` will then be the fourth element of `numbers`.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `num` is the fourth element of `numbers`, `result` is the new result of `func_1(result, num)`**
