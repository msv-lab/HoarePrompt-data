Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `num` is the fourth element of `numbers`, `result` is the new result of `func_1(result, num)`**

Explanation: The value of `result` is updated to the result of `func_1(result, num)`, where `num` is the fourth element of the list `numbers`. The list `numbers` and the variable `num` remain unchanged. The new value of `result` is the output of the function `func_1` when called with the previous value of `result` and `num`.
