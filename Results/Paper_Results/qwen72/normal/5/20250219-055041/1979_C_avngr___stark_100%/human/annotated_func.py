#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of a and b, divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). After the function concludes, the input variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function returns an integer that represents the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, and the list is non-empty.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the initial length of the list, `result` is the final result after applying `func_1` to all elements of `numbers` in sequence.
    return result
    #The program returns the final result after applying `func_1` to all elements of the list `numbers` in sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and returns a single integer that is the result of sequentially applying the function `func_1` to all elements in the list. The input list `numbers` remains unchanged after the function execution.
