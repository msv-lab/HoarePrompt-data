### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, you receive back `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`, and for the solution to be valid, `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - **`func_2(numbers)`**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers `numbers` by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements of the list.
   - The main logic of the program uses the LCM of the multipliers `k` to determine the bets `x_i` for each outcome. Specifically, it sets `x_i = m // k_i`, where `m` is the LCM of all `k_i`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.
   - It calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2(k)`.
   - It then calculates the bets `x_i` for each outcome as `m // k_i`.
   - It checks if the total amount bet `sum(c)` is less than `m`. If not, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
   - If the total amount bet is valid, it prints the bets for each outcome.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The bets `x_i` are calculated as `m // k_i`, which ensures that the amount received back for any winning outcome is `k_i * (m // k_i) = m`.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(m // k_i)`. For the solution to be valid, `sum(m // k_i) < m`.
   - This condition is checked in the program, and if it fails, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no valid distribution is possible by checking if `sum(c) >= m`.
   - It also handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over the number of test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and checks if the total amount bet is valid. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
