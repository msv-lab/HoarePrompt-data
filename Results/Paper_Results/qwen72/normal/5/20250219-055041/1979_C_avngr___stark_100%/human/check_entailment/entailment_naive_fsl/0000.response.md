Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires a function that determines how to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The program provided only contains two helper functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers. However, the program does not include the main function that would use these helpers to solve the problem as required.

To illustrate a case where the program does not work correctly, consider the following example:

Input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```

The expected output should be a list of integers representing the bets on each outcome, such as:
```
27 41 12
```

However, the provided program does not produce any output for this input, as it lacks the main function to process the input and generate the required output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
