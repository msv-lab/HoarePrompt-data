The only objects in the loop head are the variable `cnt` and the dictionary `num_of_lens`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, the loop will execute. The state of `cnt` will be the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given the initial state, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`. For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0, `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`**
