Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes `x` as a key. If `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is increased by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added as a key with a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first integer of `num_list` as a key with its value increased by 1. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, `x`'s value in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1. If `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with its value set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first and second integers of `num_list` as keys with their values increased appropriately. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens` also includes `x` as a key with its value increased appropriately. Otherwise, `num_of_lens` includes `x` as a key with a value of 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
