Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with all test cases processed, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` for each test case after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input for the last test case, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all key-value pairs from the last `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` for the last test case, `x` is the last integer in the last `num_list`, `n` is the input integer for the last test case, and `res` is the final computed value for the last test case.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with all test cases processed, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` for each test case after all iterations and must have at least one element, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input for the last test case, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all key-value pairs from the last `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` for the last test case, `x` is the last integer in the last `num_list`, `n` is the input integer for the last test case, and `res` is the final computed value for the last test case, `result` is the first element in the `results` list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with all test cases processed, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` for each test case after all iterations and must have at least two elements, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input for the last test case, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all key-value pairs from the last `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` for the last test case, `x` is the last integer in the last `num_list`, `n` is the input integer for the last test case, and `res` is the final computed value for the last test case, `result` is the second element in the `results` list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases with all test cases processed, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` for each test case after all iterations and must have at least three elements, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input for the last test case, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all key-value pairs from the last `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` for the last test case, `x` is the last integer in the last `num_list`, `n` is the input integer for the last test case, and `res` is the final computed value for the last test case, `result` is the third element in the `results` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
