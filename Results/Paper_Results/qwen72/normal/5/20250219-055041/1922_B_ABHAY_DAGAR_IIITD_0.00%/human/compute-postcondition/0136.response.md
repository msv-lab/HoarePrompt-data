Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `test_cases` is a list of test cases, and all test cases have been processed.
   - `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` for each test case after all iterations. This list has at least three elements.
   - `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input for the last test case.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with all key-value pairs from the last `num_list`.
   - `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` for the last test case.
   - `x` is the last integer in the last `num_list`.
   - `n` is the input integer for the last test case.
   - `res` is the final computed value for the last test case.
   - `result` is the third element in the `results` list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the third element in the `results` list.
   - Since `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` for each test case, and it has at least three elements, the third element is the final computed value for the third test case.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `res` for the third test case.

Output: **result (where result is the final computed value for the third test case)**
