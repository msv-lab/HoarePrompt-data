test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The length of the list test_cases is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
