Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `cnt`, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, and `cnt` is the second value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.***
