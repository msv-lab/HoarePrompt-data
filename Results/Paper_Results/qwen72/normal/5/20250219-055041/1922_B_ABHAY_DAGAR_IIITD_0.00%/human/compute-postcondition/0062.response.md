Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `x` is the last integer in `num_list`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
- The `results` list contains the final value of `res`.
- The `num_list` list is the same as the input list of integers.
- The `num_of_lens` dictionary now contains each unique integer from `num_list` as a key, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`.
- The `res` variable is updated to reflect the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements.
- The `total_count` variable is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.
- The `x` variable is set to the last integer in `num_list` after the loop completes.
