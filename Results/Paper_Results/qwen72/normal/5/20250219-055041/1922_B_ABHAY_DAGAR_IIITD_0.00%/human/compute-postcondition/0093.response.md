Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is now 1, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the first integer in the new `num_list`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. Since `num_of_lens` was initially an empty dictionary, the value of `x` (which is the first integer in `num_list`) is now set to 1.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `total_count`, `n`) remain unchanged.
