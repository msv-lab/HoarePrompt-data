The only objects in the loop head are the list `num_list` and the variable `x`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `num_list` to iterate over. At the end of the previous iteration, `num_list` must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first integer of `num_list` as a key with its value increased by 1. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, `x`'s value in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1. If `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with its value set to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least 3 integers, and `x` will now be the third integer in `num_list`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first and second integers of `num_list` as keys with their values increased appropriately.**
