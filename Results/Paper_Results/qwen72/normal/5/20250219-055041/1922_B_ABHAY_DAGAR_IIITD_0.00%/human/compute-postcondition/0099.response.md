Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and 1 as its value, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the second integer in the `num_list`, and `n` is an input integer.**

The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Since `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens` with the value 1, this assignment does not change the value of `num_of_lens[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
