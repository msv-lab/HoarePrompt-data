The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `num_list`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `num_list`. If `num_list` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `x` will be the first element in `num_list` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the first integer in `num_list`**
