The only objects in the loop head are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. The loop will execute if `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, because `num_of_lens.values()` will then return an iterable with at least one element. 

Given that `num_list` is a list of integers and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` should have at least one key-value pair if `num_list` is not empty.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair, and `cnt` should be the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`**
