Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the updated value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` must have at least three key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the third key in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens` plus the value of the second key in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it.
- `cnt` is the value of the third key in `num_of_lens`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The value of `res` is updated based on the specific value of `cnt`, which is the count of the third key in `num_of_lens`.
- The updated value of `res` is stored in the `results` list.
