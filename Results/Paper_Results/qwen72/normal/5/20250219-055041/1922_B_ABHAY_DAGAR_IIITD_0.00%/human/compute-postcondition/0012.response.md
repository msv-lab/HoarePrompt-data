Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first integer of `num_list` as a key with its value increased by 1, and `x` as a key with its value increased by 1.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, except that the value associated with the key `x` (which is the second integer in `num_list`) in the dictionary `num_of_lens` has been incremented by 1.
