The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder in the `range(test_cases)` loop. This loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the length of `test_cases`. The state of `test_cases` does not change within the loop, and `_` is not used in the loop body. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
