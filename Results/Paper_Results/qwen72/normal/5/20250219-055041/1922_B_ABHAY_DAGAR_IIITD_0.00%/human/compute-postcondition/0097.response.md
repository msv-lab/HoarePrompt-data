The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and `num_list`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If `num_list` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num_list` has at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the `num_list`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least 2 integers, and `x` must be the second integer in the `num_list`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and 1 as its value, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the second integer in the `num_list`, and `n` is an input integer.**
