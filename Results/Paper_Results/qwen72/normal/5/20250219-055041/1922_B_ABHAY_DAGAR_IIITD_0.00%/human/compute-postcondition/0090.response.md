Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` (which is 0), `x` is the last integer in the new `num_list`, `n` is an input integer.**

The `num_of_lens` dictionary is now empty, and since it is empty, `total_count` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
