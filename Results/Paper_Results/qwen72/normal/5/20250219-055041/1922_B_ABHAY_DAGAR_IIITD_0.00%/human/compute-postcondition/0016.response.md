Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `x` is the third integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first, second, and third integers of `num_list` as keys with their values increased appropriately.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is the third integer in `num_list`.
- The dictionary `num_of_lens` already includes the first and second integers of `num_list` as keys with their values increased appropriately.
- The code `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1.
- Therefore, `num_of_lens` now includes the first, second, and third integers of `num_list` as keys, with their values increased appropriately.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`) remain unchanged.
