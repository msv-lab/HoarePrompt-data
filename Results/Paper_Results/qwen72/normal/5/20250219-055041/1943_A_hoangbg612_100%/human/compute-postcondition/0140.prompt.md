Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is now a sorted list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `_` is `_ + len(N) * len(M.keys())` and must be less than `T`, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k]` is 1. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is the second smallest integer in `cnt`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, `cur` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[num]` is 1, and if `num` > `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` ≤ `cur`, `M[cur]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the second element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num`, `M[num]` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` ≤ `cur`, `M[cur]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to be equal to `num`, and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
