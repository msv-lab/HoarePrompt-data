Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the second element in `N`, `cur` is now equal to `num` if `num` > `cur` or `cur + 1` if `num` ≤ `cur`, `M[num]` is 1 if `num` > `cur`, `M[cur]` is increased by 1 if `num` ≤ `cur`. If `num` > `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `break` causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
- The values of `N`, `num`, `cur`, and `M` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `cur` and `M` based on the comparison between `num` and `cur` are still valid.
- The program breaks out of the loop or if statement if `num` > `cur + 1`.
