The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `N`. The state of `num` is updated to the next element in `N` at the start of each iteration, and the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `N`.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the first element in `N`, and `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` must be the second element in `N`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `N`, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is -1**
