To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which in this case are `num` and `N`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element
- `_` is `_ + 1` and must be less than `T`
- `num` is the first element in `N`
- If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to the first element in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.
- If `num` ≤ `cur`, `cur` remains -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `M[-1]` is 1

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains `num` and `N`.
2. **Current State of `num` and `N`**: 
   - `num` is the first element in `N`.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers and must have at least 1 element.
3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next element in `N`.
   - `N` must still have at least 1 element remaining after the current iteration.

### Adjustments:
- **`num`**: `num` should be the second element in `N` (since the first element has already been processed).
- **`N`**: `N` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
- `t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4)
- `T` remains the same (1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0)
- `n` remains the same (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` remains the same (a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n)
- `S` remains the same (an input integer)
- `N` must have at least 2 elements
- `_` remains the same (`_ + 1` and must be less than `T`)
- `num` is the second element in `N`
- `cur` and `M` remain as they are based on the conditions provided

### State:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `_` is `_ + 1` and must be less than `T`, `num` is the second element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to the second element in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking. If `num` ≤ `cur`, `cur` remains -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `M[-1]` is 1.**
