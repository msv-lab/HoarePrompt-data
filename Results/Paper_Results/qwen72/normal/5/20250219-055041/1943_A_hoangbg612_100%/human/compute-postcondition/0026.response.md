The objects in the loop head are `num` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `N`. If `N` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. 

At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `N`, and `cur` is updated based on the comparison between `num` and `cur`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `N` must have at least 3 elements.
- `num` will be the third element in `N`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key. If `num` > `cur`, `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 1, and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 0, and `cur` remains -1.**
