Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`. If the sum of the values in `M` (i.e., the counts of the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1`) is equal to `S`, then `cur` is updated to be the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 2`, and `M` is updated to include the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 2` with their respective counts. `cnt` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key (which is `cur`), and `cnt` is an empty list if `M[cur]` is not 1. If `M[cur]` is 1, `cnt` is a list containing the key `cur`, and the value of `M` at key `cur` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with at least two keys (one of which is `cur`), and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` contains the key `cur` and the value `k` appended to it. If `M[cur]` is 1, `cnt` is a list containing the key `cur` and the value `k` appended to it. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with at least two keys (one of which is `cur`), `k` is the next key in the iteration, and `cnt` remains as defined in the previous state. If `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` now includes `k` in its list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
