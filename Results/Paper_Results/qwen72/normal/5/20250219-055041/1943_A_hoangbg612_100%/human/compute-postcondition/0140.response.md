Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`.**

### Explanation:
- **`N`**: Remains a sorted list of integers as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cur`**: After all iterations, `cur` will be the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution. This means `cur` will be the largest integer in `N` that was processed without breaking out of the loop.
- **`M`**: The dictionary `M` will contain the unique integers from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1`, with their values being the counts of these integers in `N`. If the loop breaks due to `num > cur + 1`, the dictionary will not include any integers that come after this point in `N`.
- **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `T`, `n`, `a`, `S`, and `_` are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged.
