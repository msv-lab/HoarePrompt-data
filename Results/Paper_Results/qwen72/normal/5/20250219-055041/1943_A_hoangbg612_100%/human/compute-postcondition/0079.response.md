The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `N` and the current value of `num`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements
- `_` is `_ + 1` and must be less than `T`
- `num` is the second element in `N`
- If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to the second element in `N`, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value
- If `num` > `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement
- If `num` ≤ `cur`, `cur` remains -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `M[-1]` is 1
- If `num` > `cur` and `num` ≤ `cur + 1`, `cur` is updated to the second element in `N`, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 2 as its value

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `N` must have at least 3 elements (since `N` must have at least 2 elements and we are moving to the next element)
- `num` must be the third element in `N`

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`.**
