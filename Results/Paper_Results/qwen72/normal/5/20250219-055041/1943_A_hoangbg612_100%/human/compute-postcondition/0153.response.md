Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with at least two keys (one of which is `cur`), `k` is the next key in the iteration, `cnt` now includes `k` in its list.** 

The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` adds the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. The other variables and their properties remain unchanged. The list `cnt` now contains the value `k` as an additional element.
