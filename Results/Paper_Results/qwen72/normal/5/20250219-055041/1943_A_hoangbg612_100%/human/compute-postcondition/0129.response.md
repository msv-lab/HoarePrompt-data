Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the second element in `N`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[num]` is set to 1, `M[cur]` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `M[cur]` has been set to 1, which is the same as `M[num]` since `cur` is equal to `num`. The other details from the initial state remain unchanged.
