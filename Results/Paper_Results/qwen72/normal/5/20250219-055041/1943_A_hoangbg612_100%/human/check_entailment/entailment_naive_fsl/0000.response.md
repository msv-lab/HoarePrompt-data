Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `a` contains multiple occurrences of the same number, and the optimal strategy for both players is not correctly implemented. Here is a specific example where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output from the given program:
```
1
```

The program incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `2`. The issue lies in the logic where the program tries to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. The program does not correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, and it does not account for the optimal strategy of both players. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where Alice and Bob might choose the same number multiple times, and it does not correctly update the MEX value based on the optimal play.
