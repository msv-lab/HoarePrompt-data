Postcondition: ***`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key (which is `cur`), and `cnt` is an empty list if `M[cur]` is not 1. If `M[cur]` is 1, `cnt` is a list containing the key `cur`, and the value of `M` at key `cur` is 1.***
