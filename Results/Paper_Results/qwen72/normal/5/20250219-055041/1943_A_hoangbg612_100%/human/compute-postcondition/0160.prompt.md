Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    cnt = []
    for k in M.keys():
        if M[k] == 1:
            cnt.append(k)
    if len(cnt) >= 2:
        cur = cnt[1]
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1, `M` is a dictionary with keys being the elements in `N` that are not greater than `cur` + 1, and each key's value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that key in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks or ends. `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is the second smallest element in `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `M` is a dictionary with keys from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `N` and was not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of its appearance, `_` is `_ + len(N) * len(M.keys())` and must be less than `T`, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k]` is 1. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is the second smallest integer in `cnt`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at the start of the loop, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`, and `cnt` is a list containing all the unique integers from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and have a count of 1 in `M`. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is the second smallest unique integer in `cnt` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at the start of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
