Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1, `M` is a dictionary with keys being the elements in `N` that are not greater than `cur` + 1, and each key's value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that key in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks or ends. `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variables `t`, `T`, `n`, `a`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `cur` remains the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `M` remains a dictionary with keys being the elements in `N` that are not greater than `cur` + 1, and each key's value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that key in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks or ends.
- The variable `cnt` is a list that contains all keys from `M` for which the value is 1. This means that for each key in `M`, if the key's value is 1, it will be appended to `cnt`. If no keys in `M` have a value of 1, `cnt` will remain an empty list.
