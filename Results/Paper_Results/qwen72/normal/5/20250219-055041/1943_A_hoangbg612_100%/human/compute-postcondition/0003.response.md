The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `N`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `S` is an input integer
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5

After the code execution:
- `N` is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of converting the input string elements to integers.
- The values of `t`, `T`, `n`, `a`, and `S` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
