Output State: **`N` is a list of integers read from the input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `M` is a dictionary with keys from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `N` and was not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of its appearance, `_` is `_ + len(N) * len(M.keys())` and must be less than `T`, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k]` is 1. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is the second smallest integer in `cnt`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to `N`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `T`, `n`, `a`, `S`, `M`, `_`, `cnt`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `N` is a list of integers, and the initial constraints on `N` (being a sorted list of integers read from the input) are now satisfied as `N` has been updated with the input values.
