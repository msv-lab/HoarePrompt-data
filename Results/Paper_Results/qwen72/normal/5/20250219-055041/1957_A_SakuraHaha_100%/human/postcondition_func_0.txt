The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of stick lengths, followed by a list of `n` integers `a` representing the stick lengths. It then calculates the number of groups of three sticks that can be formed from the input list, where each group has the same stick length. The result is printed as an integer. The function does not return any value.
