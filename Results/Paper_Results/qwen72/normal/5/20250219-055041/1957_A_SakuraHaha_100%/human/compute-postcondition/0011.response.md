The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the dictionary `cnt`. For the loop to execute, `cnt` must have at least one key-value pair, and `x` will be the value of the first key-value pair in `cnt`.

State: **`cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, and `cnt` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the value of the first key-value pair in `cnt`, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 0**
