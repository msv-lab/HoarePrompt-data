#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 0.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the integer divisions of each value in the `cnt` dictionary by 3)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of stick lengths, followed by a list of `n` integers `a` representing the stick lengths. It then calculates the number of groups of three sticks that can be formed from the input list, where each group has the same stick length. The result is printed as an integer. The function does not return any value.
