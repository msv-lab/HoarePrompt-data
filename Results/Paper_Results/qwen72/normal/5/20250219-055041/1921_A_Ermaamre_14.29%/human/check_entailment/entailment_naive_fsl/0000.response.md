Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the coordinates of the square's corners. Specifically, the program assumes a specific order of the input coordinates and only checks a limited set of conditions to determine the side length of the square. However, the problem statement guarantees that the input coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, but does not specify the order of the coordinates. Therefore, the program may fail to correctly compute the area if the coordinates are not in the expected order.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5
```
The program will not correctly compute the area because it does not handle the case where the first and third coordinates have the same x-values and the second and fourth coordinates have the same x-values. The correct area should be 9, but the program will not return this value.
