Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are new input integers, `res` is the absolute value of `y1 - y2`.**

The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is now the absolute value of `y1 - y2`.
