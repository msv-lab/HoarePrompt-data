The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples. Each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is exactly one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if the given coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the coordinates form such a square.
