The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `i` should be 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
