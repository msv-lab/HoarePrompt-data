Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`, `i` is `2 * n` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is the number of elements added to `res`, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `ur` is the total number of elements in `a` (from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`. If `ul` equals `ur`, then `ur` remains 0.***
