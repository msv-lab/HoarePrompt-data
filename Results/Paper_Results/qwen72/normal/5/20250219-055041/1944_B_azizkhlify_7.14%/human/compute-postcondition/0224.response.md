Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is the new input integer, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, and the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 2.**
