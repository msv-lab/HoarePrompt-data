Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is at least 2.
- `k` is assigned the value from the input.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is 2.
- `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is 2.
- `ur` is 0 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`. Otherwise, `ul` and `ur` retain their initial values of 0.
- If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Print Statement:
```
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

2. **Value of `a[i]`**:
   - `a[i]` is the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

3. **Output of the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (because of `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Since `i` is 2, the print statement will print the value of `a[2]` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
