Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `k` is assigned the value from the input.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` and `ur` are initially 0. If `ul` is `k * 2`, then `ur` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ul` and `ur` retain their initial values of 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is set to 1.
- The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Values of `a[i]`:
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to the second element of the list `a`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the second element of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list a)**
