Postcondition: **`res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0). `i` is the last element in `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`, and for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2; otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the loop breaks early and `i` remains the last element in `res`.**
