To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0).
   - `i` is the first element in `res`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `res` is a list that has been populated with elements from `a` based on a specific condition: `l[a[j] - 1]` must be 1.
   - `i` is the first element in this list `res`.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `i` is the first element in `res`, and `res` contains elements from `a` that satisfy the condition `l[a[j] - 1] == 1`, the value of `i` will be the first such element from `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the first element in the list `res`, followed by a space.

Output: **[i] (where i is the first element in the list res)**
