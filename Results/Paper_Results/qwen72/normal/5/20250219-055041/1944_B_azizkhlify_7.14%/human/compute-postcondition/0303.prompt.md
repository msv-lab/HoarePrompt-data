Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and k is an integer such that 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`res` is a list with elements that satisfied the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop has iterated through all elements of `a`. `i` is the last element of `res` if `res` is not empty. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is increased by 2 for each `i` in the range `[n, 2 * n)` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. The loop breaks when `ul == ur` or when `i` reaches `2 * n`. If `ul` was already equal to `ur` before the if statement, the values of `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`, `i` is `2 * n` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is the number of elements added to `res`, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `ur` is the total number of elements in `a` (from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`. If `ul` equals `ur`, then `ur` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0). `i` is the last element in `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`, and for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2; otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the loop breaks early and `i` remains the last element in `res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
