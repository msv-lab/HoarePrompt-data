Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list of integers.
2. `n` is at least 2.
3. `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`.
4. `i` is 2.
5. `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
6. `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1.
7. `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`.
8. `ur` is 0.
9. `k` is non-zero.
10. If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
11. If `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, `res` contains the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`), and `re` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list and `re` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: We know `a` is a list of integers, but the exact values are not provided. However, we know that `i` is 2, so we need to determine `a[2]`.
2. **Index `i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
3. **Element `a[2]`**: Since `i` is 2, the code will print the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

### Output:
The code will print the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list `a`)**
