Based on the provided initial state and the Python code snippet, the `print()` statement does not contain any arguments. Therefore, it will simply print a newline character, which is an empty line.

Output: **(an empty line)**

To break down the reasoning:
- The `print()` statement is called without any arguments.
- This means that it will not print any specific values or variables.
- The default behavior of `print()` when called with no arguments is to print a newline character, which results in an empty line being printed.

Therefore, the output is an empty line.
