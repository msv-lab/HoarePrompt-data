Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is the new input integer, `i` is `n + 2`, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n-1] - 1]`, `r[a[n] - 1]`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` which are incremented by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is `n + 2`.
- The list `r` is updated by incrementing the element at index `a[i] - 1` by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
