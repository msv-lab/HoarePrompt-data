Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
- `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 1.
- `k` is a new input integer.
- `i` is 2.
- `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` remains 0.
- `ur` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is 2.
2. **Variable `a`**: `a` is a list of integers. The exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, but we know that `a` is indexed starting from 0.
3. **Accessing `a[i]`**: Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` will be the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Output:
The value of `a[i]` is the element at index 2 of the list `a`. Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index 2 of `a`.

Output: **[a[2]] [a[2]] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list a)**
