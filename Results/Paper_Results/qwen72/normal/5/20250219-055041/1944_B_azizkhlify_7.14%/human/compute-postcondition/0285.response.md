Postcondition: **`res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0), `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `ul` is not equal to `ur`, and `ul` is equal to `ur`. The current value of `ur` is such that it has been increased by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2 for any `i` up to `n`, otherwise `ur` remains unchanged.**
