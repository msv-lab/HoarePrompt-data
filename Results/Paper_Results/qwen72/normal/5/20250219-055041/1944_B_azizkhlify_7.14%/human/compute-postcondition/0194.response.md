Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`.
- `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
- `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1.
- `re` is the number of elements added to `res`.
- `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `ur` is 2 if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ur` remains 0.
- If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is defined as `n + 1`. This means `i` is the index of the element in `a` that is one position after the first `n` elements.

2. **Variable `a[i]`**:
   - `a[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, `a[i]` is the element at index `n + 1` in `a`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.

### Output Calculation:
- Since `i` is `n + 1`, the value of `a[i]` is the element at index `n + 1` in the list `a`.
- The print statement will print this value twice, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[n + 1] a[n + 1] (where a[n + 1] is the element at index n + 1 in the list a)**

This output is based on the given initial state and the specific print statement provided.
