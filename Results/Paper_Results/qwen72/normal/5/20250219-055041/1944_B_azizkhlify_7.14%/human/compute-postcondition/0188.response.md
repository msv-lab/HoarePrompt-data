To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`a` is a list of integers**: This is the main list we are working with.
2. **`n` must be at least 1**: This is the length of the initial segment of the list `a` we are considering.
3. **`k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`**: This is a formula for `k`, but it's a bit circular. We need to understand the context in which `k` is defined and updated.
4. **`res` is a list containing all elements from `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`**: This list is populated based on the frequency of elements in the first `n` elements of `a`.
5. **`i` is `i + 1`**: This indicates that `i` is being incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is not explicitly given, but we can assume it starts at 0.
6. **`l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1**: This list `l` is used to count the occurrences of elements in the first `n` elements of `a`.
7. **`r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1**: This list `r` is used to count the occurrences of elements in the second segment of the first `2 * n` elements of `a`.
8. **`re` is the number of elements added to `res`**: This is the count of unique elements in the first `n` elements of `a`.
9. **`ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`**: This is the count of elements that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements.
10. **`ur` is 0**: This is an additional variable, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- **`i` is `i + 1`**: This means `i` is being incremented by 1. If `i` starts at 0, then after the increment, `i` will be 1.
- **`a[i]`**: This will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Since `i` is now 1, it will print `a[1]`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the element at index 1 of the list `a` twice, followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
