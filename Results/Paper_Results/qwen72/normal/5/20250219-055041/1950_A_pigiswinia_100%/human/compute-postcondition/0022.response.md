The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

Based on the initial state provided:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to new input integers.
- If the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is less than the new `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds.
- If the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is greater than the new `c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds.
- If neither of these conditions is met, then neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('PEAK')
```

This statement will always print the string 'PEAK' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` because the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the literal string 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
