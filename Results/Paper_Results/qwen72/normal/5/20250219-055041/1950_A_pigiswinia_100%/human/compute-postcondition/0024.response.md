Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to new input integers. If the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is greater than the new `c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` does not hold, and the conditions `a < b < c` or neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` may hold depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.***
