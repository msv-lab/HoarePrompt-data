Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. The use of `map(int, input().split())` ensures that the input is correctly split and converted to integers, which is appropriate for the problem constraints.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The function checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correctly implemented.
   - The function checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correctly implemented.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, the function prints "NONE". This is the correct fallback behavior as per the problem description.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should result in "NONE". This is correctly handled by the `else` clause.
   - The function also handles cases where the digits are in different orders (e.g., `3 4 1` and `1 5 3`), which should result in "PEAK". These cases are correctly identified by the `elif` clause.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The constraints `1 <= t <= 1000` and `0 <= a, b, c <= 9` are respected by the input handling and the logic of the function. The function does not perform any operations that would violate these constraints.

Given the above analysis, the function `func` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all valid inputs and produces the correct output for each test case.

Final: **True**
