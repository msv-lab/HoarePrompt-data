The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the default start value for `range(t)`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0**
