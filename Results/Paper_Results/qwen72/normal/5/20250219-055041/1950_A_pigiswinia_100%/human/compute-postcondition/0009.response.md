Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.
- It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
