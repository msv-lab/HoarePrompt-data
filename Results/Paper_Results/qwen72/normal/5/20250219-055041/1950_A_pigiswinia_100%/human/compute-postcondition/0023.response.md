To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to new input integers.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is less than the new `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds.
   - If the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is greater than the new `c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, then neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` holds.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print('NONE')`.

Given the conditions, the `print` statement will always print `'NONE'` because the conditions described do not affect the execution of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to print the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **NONE**
