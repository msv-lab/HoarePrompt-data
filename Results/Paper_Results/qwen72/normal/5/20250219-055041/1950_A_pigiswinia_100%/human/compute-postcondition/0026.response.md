Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds, and 'STAIR' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds, and 'PEAK' is printed. If neither of these conditions is met, then 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each iteration, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` were updated to new input integers. During each iteration, if `a` was less than `b` and `b` was less than `c`, 'STAIR' was printed. If `a` was less than `b` and `b` was greater than `c`, 'PEAK' was printed. If neither of these conditions was met, 'NONE' was printed. After `t` iterations, the loop has completed, and `i` is now `t-1`.
