Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.
- Additionally, `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.

Given these conditions, we can infer the following:
- `a < b` and `b > c` implies that `b` is a peak value, as it is greater than both `a` and `c`.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string 'PEAK'. Since the conditions in the initial state are met (i.e., `b` is a peak value), the `print` statement will execute and print 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
