Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the input as specified. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program then checks the conditions for a "stair" (`a < b < c`) and a "peak" (`a < b > c`). If either condition is met, it prints the corresponding output; otherwise, it prints "NONE". The logic and the flow of the program are consistent with the problem requirements, and it handles all edge cases as described in the example.

Correctness: **True**
