The given code snippet is:

```
print('NONE')
```

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to new input integers.
- If the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is less than the new `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds.
- Otherwise, it is not the case that the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is less than the new `c`.
- If the new `a` is less than the new `b` and the new `b` is greater than the new `c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds.
- Otherwise, the condition `a < b > c` does not hold.

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes the conditions under which the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated and the relationships between them.
- However, the code snippet does not actually use any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'NONE'`.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, or `i`.

Output: **NONE**
