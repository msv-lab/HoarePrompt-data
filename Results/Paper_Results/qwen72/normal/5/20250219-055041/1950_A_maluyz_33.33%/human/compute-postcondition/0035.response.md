The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function might internally use or accept values for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. 

Since the output details are not provided, I can only describe the parameters the function might use internally or accept. 

Functionality: **The function internally uses or accepts values for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits between 0 and 9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not defined in the provided constraints.**
