The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then this relationship holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, then they are equal to each other. If they are not all equal, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `a` or `c`, but not `b`.**
