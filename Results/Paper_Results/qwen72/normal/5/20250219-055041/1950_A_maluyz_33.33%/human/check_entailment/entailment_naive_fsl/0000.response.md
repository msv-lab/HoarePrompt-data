Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the digits are in descending order (e.g., 3 2 1). According to the problem description, this should output "NONE", but the program incorrectly outputs "PEAK" because it only checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits, without ensuring that `a > b` and `b > c`. 

For example, when the input is:
```
3 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
PEAK
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
NONE
```
