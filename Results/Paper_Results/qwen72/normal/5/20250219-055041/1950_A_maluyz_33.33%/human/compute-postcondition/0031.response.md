Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then this relationship holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, then they are equal to each other. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `a` or `c`, but not `b`.***
