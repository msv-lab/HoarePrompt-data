The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. It then processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (digits between 0 and 9). For each test case, the function prints one of the following strings based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c`: 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of the three and `a` and `c` are not equal to `b`, or 'NONE' in all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
