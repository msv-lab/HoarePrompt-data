Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`. Additionally, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal. If `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c`, then the current value of `b` is the maximum. Otherwise, the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b`.***
