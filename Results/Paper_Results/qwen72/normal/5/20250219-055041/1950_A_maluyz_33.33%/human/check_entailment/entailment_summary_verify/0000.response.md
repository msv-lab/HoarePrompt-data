Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func` does not correctly handle the case where the digits are in descending order (e.g., 3 2 1). According to the problem description, this should output "NONE", but the program incorrectly outputs "PEAK" because it only checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits, without ensuring that `a > b` and `b > c`. 

The function summary states that the function prints 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of the three digits. However, this condition is not sufficient to determine a peak, as a peak should also satisfy `a < b` and `b > c`. The current implementation fails to check the second part of the condition (`b > c`), leading to incorrect outputs for descending sequences.

For example, when the input is:
```
3 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
PEAK
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
NONE
```

This confirms that the program is indeed incorrect based on the problem description and the function summary.

Final: **False**
