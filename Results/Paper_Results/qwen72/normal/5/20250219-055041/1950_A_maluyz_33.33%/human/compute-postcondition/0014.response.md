Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, then they are equal to each other. Otherwise, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal, and if `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c`, then the current value of `b` is the maximum. If `b` is not the maximum, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b`.***
