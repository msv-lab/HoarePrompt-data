To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `n` is the first element of the second test case in the `test_cases` list. To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `j` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting index for the `range(n)`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.

The other variables and objects in the initial state do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, `j` is 0**
