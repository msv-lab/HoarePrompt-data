The only objects in the loop head are `test_case` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least 1 test case, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must have at least 1 test case, and `test_case` will be the first test case in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list**
