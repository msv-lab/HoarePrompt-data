The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` is initialized by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted. 

Given the initial state, `n` is the first element of the first test case, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 test case. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False**
