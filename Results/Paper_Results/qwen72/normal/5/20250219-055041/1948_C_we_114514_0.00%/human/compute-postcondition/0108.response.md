Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is True if the last character of `row2` is '>', otherwise it remains False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' or 'NO' and now includes an additional 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO'.**
