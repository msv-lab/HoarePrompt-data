The only objects in the loop head are `test_case` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least 3 test cases, the loop can execute again for the third test case. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases, and `test_case` is the second test case in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least 3 test cases, and `test_case` will be the third test case in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is True if the last character of `row2` is '>', otherwise it remains False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' or 'NO' and now includes an additional 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO'.**
