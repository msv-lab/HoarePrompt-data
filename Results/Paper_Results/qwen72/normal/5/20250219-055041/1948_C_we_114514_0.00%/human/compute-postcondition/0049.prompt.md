Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` remains True. If `row2[j]` is not '>', `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is False, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than 1, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is 1. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j]` is '>', and `j` is `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains True and `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j]` is not '>', both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is False, both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than 2, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `j` is 2. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j] == '>'` and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged and `reachable_second_row` is True. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j] == '>'` and `j` is not equal to `n - 1`, both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j] != '>'`, both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is False, both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
