The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, which means the loop has just completed its last iteration.

However, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be reset or adjusted to a value that is less than `n`. Since the loop is iterating over `range(n)`, the next value of `j` would be `0` if the loop were to start over, but in the context of a single iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `n - 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the conditions:
- `j` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be `n - 1` at the start of the next iteration, and `n` must remain greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) with at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO', `j` is `n - 1`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_second_row` remains True. If `j` == `n` - 1, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `reachable_first_row` is False if `row1[j]` != '>', otherwise `reachable_first_row` is not affected. If `j` < `n` - 1 and `row2[j]` != '>', then `reachable_second_row` is False and `reachable_first_row` is False if `row1[j]` != '>', otherwise `reachable_first_row` is not affected. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then `reachable_second_row` remains False.**
