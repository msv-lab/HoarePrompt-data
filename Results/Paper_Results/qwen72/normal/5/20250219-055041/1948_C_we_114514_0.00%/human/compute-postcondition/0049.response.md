Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case. `reachable_first_row` is False if any character in `row1` is not '>', otherwise it remains True. `reachable_second_row` is True if `row1` contains a '>' and `row2` contains a '>' at the position immediately after the last '>' in `row1`, or if `row1` does not contain any '>' and `row2` contains a '>' at any position, otherwise it remains False.**

### Explanation:
- **`reachable_first_row`**: This variable starts as True. It remains True only if every character in `row1` is '>'. If any character in `row1` is not '>', `reachable_first_row` becomes False and stays False for the rest of the loop.
- **`reachable_second_row`**: This variable starts as False. It becomes True if:
  - `row1` contains a '>' and `row2` contains a '>' at the position immediately after the last '>' in `row1`.
  - `row1` does not contain any '>' and `row2` contains a '>' at any position.
  - If neither of these conditions is met, `reachable_second_row` remains False.

After the loop completes all iterations, the final state of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will reflect whether the conditions described above were met during the loop execution.
