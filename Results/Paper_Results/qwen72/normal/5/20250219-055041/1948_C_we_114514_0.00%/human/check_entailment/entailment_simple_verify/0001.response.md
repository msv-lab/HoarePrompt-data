### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `row1` and `row2`.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case and determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
   - This initialization is correct because the robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can initially only be in the first row.

4. **Loop Through Columns**:
   - The function iterates through each column `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - It checks the current state of the robot and updates the reachability flags based on the direction of the arrows in the current column.

5. **First Row Check**:
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row and potentially reach the target).
       - If the robot is not at the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` and `reachable_first_row` to `False` (indicating the robot moves to the second row).
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - The robot can no longer stay in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.

6. **Second Row Check**:
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it appends 'YES' to the results list and breaks out of the loop (indicating the robot can reach the target).
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the left (`row2[j] == '<'`) and the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False` (indicating the robot moves back to the first row).

7. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

8. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Issues in the Original Program:
- **First Row Check**:
  - The original program only sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` if the robot is at the last column and the arrow in the first row points to the right. This is incorrect because the robot can move to the second row from any column if the arrow in the first row points to the right and the arrow in the second row points to the right.
- **Second Row Check**:
  - The original program does not handle the case where the robot can move back to the first row if the arrow in the second row points to the left and the arrow in the first row points to the right.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program addresses these issues and should correctly determine the reachability of the target cell `(2, n)`.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original program is incorrect due to the logical issues identified.
- The corrected program is correct and should work as expected based on the problem description.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect.)
