Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it determines if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the logic for updating `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` is not correctly simulating the robot's movement according to the problem's rules.

### Explanation of the Flaw:
1. **Movement Simulation**: The robot must move left, right, down, or up in the first step, and then follow the arrow in the current cell. The provided code does not correctly simulate this two-step movement process.
2. **State Management**: The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are not correctly maintained to reflect the robot's ability to move between rows and columns as described in the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), you should:
1. Simulate the robot's movement step by step.
2. Keep track of the robot's current position and the direction it can move.
3. Ensure that the robot can move to the next cell and follow the arrow in that cell.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_end(n, row1, row2):
    # Initialize the robot's position
    position = (1, 0)  # (row, column)
    
    # Define the movement based on the arrow direction
    def move(position, direction):
        row, col = position
        if direction == '>':
            return (row, col + 1)
        else:
            return (row, col - 1)
    
    # Simulate the robot's movement
    while position[1] < n - 1:
        row, col = position
        if row == 1:
            if row1[col] == '>':
                position = move(position, row1[col])
            else:
                position = (2, col)
        else:  # row == 2
            if row2[col] == '>':
                position = move(position, row2[col])
            else:
                position = (1, col)
    
    # Check if the robot can reach the end cell (2, n-1)
    if position == (2, n - 1):
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        result = can_reach_end(n, row1, row2)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Initialization**: The robot starts at position (1, 0).
2. **Movement Function**: The `move` function updates the robot's position based on the arrow direction.
3. **Simulation Loop**: The loop continues until the robot reaches the last column (n-1).
4. **Row Switching**: If the robot encounters a '<' arrow, it switches to the other row.
5. **Final Check**: After the loop, the code checks if the robot is at the end cell (2, n-1).

This corrected approach ensures that the robot's movement is accurately simulated and the problem's constraints are respected.
