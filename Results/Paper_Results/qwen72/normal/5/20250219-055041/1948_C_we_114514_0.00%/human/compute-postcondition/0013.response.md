Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is False. Additionally, `row1[j]` is not equal to '>', and `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is equal to '>'**.
