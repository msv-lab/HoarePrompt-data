Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) with at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO', `j` is `n - 1`. `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are updated based on the conditions described in the loop, and their final values depend on the characters in `row1` and `row2` at each position `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. Additionally, `reachable_second_row` is false.**
