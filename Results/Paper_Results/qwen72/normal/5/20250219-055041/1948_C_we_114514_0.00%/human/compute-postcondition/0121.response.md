Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO', the character at position `j` in `row1` is not '>', `j` is less than `n - 1`, and the character at position `j` in `row2` is '>'**.
