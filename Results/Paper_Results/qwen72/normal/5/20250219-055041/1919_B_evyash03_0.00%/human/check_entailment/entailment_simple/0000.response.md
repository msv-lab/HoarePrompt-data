### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to split the array `a` (derived from the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The optimal strategy to minimize the penalty is to split the array at points where the sum of the subarray becomes zero, or as close to zero as possible.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - The string `s` is split into parts using the character `-` as a delimiter. This step is not necessary for the problem and may lead to incorrect results. The correct approach should be to process the string `s` directly without splitting it.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `expression` and the length `result_length`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `expression`.
   - For each `+`, the `balance` is incremented by 1.
   - For each `-`, the `balance` is decremented by 1.
   - If the `balance` goes below 0, it means the sum of the subarray up to that point is negative. The program then increments `count` by 1 and resets `balance` to 0.
   - After processing all characters, the function returns `count + (balance > 0)`. This means it adds 1 to the count if the final `balance` is positive, indicating that the last subarray has a positive sum.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach of resetting the `balance` to 0 whenever it goes below 0 is correct because it ensures that we are starting a new subarray whenever the sum of the current subarray becomes negative.
   - The final check `balance > 0` is also correct because if the last subarray has a positive sum, it should be counted as a penalty.

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The line `parts = expression.split('-')` is unnecessary and can be removed. The program should process the string `expression` directly without splitting it.
   - The variable `result_length` is not used in the function `func_1` and can be removed from the function call.

### Correctness:
Despite the unnecessary `split` operation and the unused `result_length` variable, the core logic of the function `func_1` is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct in terms of its logic and output.

Correctness: **True**
