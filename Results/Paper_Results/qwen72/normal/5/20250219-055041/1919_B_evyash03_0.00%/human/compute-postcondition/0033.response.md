Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` of length `length` (1 ≤ length ≤ 5000) consisting only of '+' and '-' characters, and an integer `length`. It returns the number of times the balance (the cumulative count of '+' minus '-') went below zero during the processing of the string, plus 1 if the final balance is greater than zero. **
