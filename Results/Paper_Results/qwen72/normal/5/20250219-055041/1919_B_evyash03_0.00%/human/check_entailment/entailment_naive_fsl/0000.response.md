Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

### Case Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   5
   +++++
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   5
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   1
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   The program incorrectly splits the string and calculates the penalty. The optimal way to split `+++++` is `([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, which results in a penalty of `5`. However, the program returns `1`.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   6
   +-+-+-
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   0
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   3
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   The program incorrectly calculates the penalty. The optimal way to split `+-+-+-` is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `0`. However, the program returns `3`.

3. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   10
   --+++++++-
   ```
   **Expected Output:**
   ```
   4
   ```
   **Actual Output:**
   ```
   4
   ```
   **Explanation:**
   This case happens to work correctly, but it is not a general solution.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the following:
- The optimal way to split the array `a` is to split it into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
- This can be achieved by splitting the array at points where the cumulative sum of the array elements returns to zero or changes sign.

The provided program does not handle these cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
