The value of `balance` is decremented by 1. The other variables, `expression` and `char`, remain unchanged. Since `char` is the second character in `expression`, and `expression` consists only of '+' and '-', `char` is either '+' or '-'.

Output State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `char` is the second character in `expression` (either '+' or '-'), `balance` is decreased by 1.**
