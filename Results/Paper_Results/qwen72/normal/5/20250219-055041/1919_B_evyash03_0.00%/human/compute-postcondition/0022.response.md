The only objects in the loop head are the variables `char` and `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `expression`. If there are more characters in `expression`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the second character in `expression`, and `expression` is a string of length `length`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` will be the third character in `expression`, and `expression` must still have at least one more character to process. Therefore, the length of `expression` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (2 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `char` is the third character in `expression` (either '+' or '-').**
