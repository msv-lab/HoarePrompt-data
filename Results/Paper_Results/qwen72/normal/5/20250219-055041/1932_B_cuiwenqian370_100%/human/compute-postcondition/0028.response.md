Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `a[0]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by `n`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `last_year` is updated to the value of `a[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
