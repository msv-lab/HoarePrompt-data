Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `last_year` is equal to the original `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`, `index` is incremented by `n`**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` remains a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
- `n` remains greater than 3.
- `i` remains 3.
- `last_year` is still equal to the original `next_year`.
- `next_year` is updated to `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`.
- `results` still includes the string representation of the original `last_year`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `T` must still be greater than `_`.
- `index` is incremented by `n`.
