Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 2, `T` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.** 

The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
