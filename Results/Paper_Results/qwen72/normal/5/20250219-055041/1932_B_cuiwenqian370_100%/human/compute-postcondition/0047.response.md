Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_year` is equal to `a[0]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `next_year` is updated to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
