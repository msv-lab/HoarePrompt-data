Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur. The logic used to calculate the next occurrence year of each sign is correct and ensures that the signs occur sequentially as described. Specifically, the line `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` correctly computes the next year in which the i-th sign will occur, strictly after the last year in which the (i-1)-th sign occurred. This ensures that the signs occur in the required sequence and the final year is correctly calculated for each test case.
