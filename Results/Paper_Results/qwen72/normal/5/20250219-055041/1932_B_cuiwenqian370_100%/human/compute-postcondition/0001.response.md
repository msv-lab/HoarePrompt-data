Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6.
- The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace.
- The variable `data` is now a list of strings, but the values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `n` and `a`, and the new value of `data` as a list of strings.
