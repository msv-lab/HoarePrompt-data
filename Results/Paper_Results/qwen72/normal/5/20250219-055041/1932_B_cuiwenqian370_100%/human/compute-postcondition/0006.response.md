To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```
for _ in range(T):
```

The only variable in the loop head is `T`. The loop will execute if `T` is greater than 0. The other variables and objects mentioned in the state before the loop starts (`n`, `a`, `data`, `index`, `results`) are not directly part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input
- `index` is 1
- `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`
- `results` is an empty list

We need to ensure that `T` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables and objects can remain as they are, as they do not affect the loop's execution directly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 1, `T` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
