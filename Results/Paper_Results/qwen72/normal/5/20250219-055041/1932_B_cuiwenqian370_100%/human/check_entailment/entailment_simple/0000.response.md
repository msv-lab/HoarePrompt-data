### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of the list is the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - The `last_year` is then updated to `next_year`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to `sys.stdout` as a newline-separated string.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n = 1` (i.e., only one sign).
   - It also handles the case where all periodicities are 1, which should result in the year `n` for the apocalypse.

5. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula \(\left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}\) is mathematically correct for finding the next multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - This ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required by the problem.

6. **State of the Program:**
   - The state of the program after each iteration of the loop is correctly described in the comments.
   - The final state of the program is also correctly described, with `results` containing the string representations of the final `last_year` values for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, and it handles all edge cases and input constraints as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
