Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`**

The value of `last_year` is updated to be the same as `next_year`, which is calculated as `((last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1]) * a[1]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The expression for `next_year` is also unchanged, but now `last_year` holds the same value as `next_year`.
