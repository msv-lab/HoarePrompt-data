Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. The core logic of the program is to calculate the next year in which each subsequent sign will occur, starting from the first sign. The formula used in the program:

```python
next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
```

is correct for finding the next occurrence of the i-th sign after the (i-1)-th sign has occurred. This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is efficient for large inputs. It then splits the input into a list of strings.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`, which is the year the first sign occurs.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula mentioned above.
   - It updates `last_year` to this new year and continues to the next sign.

3. **Output Writing**: After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to `sys.stdout`, each on a new line.

The program correctly follows the problem's requirements and the execution summary confirms that it processes the input and produces the expected output. The logic for calculating the next year is sound and matches the problem's constraints and examples.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
