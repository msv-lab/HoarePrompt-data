Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the value of `a` to a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `last_year`, `next_year`, `results`, `_`, `T`, and `index`) are not directly affected by this code, so their values remain as described in the initial state. However, the value of `index` is mentioned to be incremented by `n + 1` in the initial state, which is still valid in the output state.
