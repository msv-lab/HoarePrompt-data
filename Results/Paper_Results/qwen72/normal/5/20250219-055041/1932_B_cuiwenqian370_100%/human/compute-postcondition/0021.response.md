Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop will execute `n-1` times, as it starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n-1`.
- After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`.
- The variable `last_year` will be updated to the value of `next_year` after the last iteration, which is calculated as `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`.
- The variable `next_year` will also be equal to this final value of `last_year` after the last iteration.
- The other variables (`data`, `index`, `results`, `a`, and the initial value of `last_year` before the loop) remain unchanged.
