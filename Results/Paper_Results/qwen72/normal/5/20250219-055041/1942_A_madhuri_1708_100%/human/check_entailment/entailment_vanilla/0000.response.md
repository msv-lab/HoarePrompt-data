### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input from standard input. The first line is skipped (presumably the number of test cases), and then each subsequent line is processed.
   - Each line is split into two integers `n` and `k`, representing the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts required.

2. **Conditions and Output:**
   - **Case 1: `k >= 2`**
     - **Sub-case 1: `n == k`**
       - If `n` is equal to `k`, the program prints an array of `n` elements, all of which are `k`.
       - This is correct because if `n == k`, all cyclic shifts of the array will be sorted. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the array `[3, 3, 3]` will have all three cyclic shifts sorted.
     - **Sub-case 2: `n != k`**
       - If `n` is not equal to `k`, the program prints `-1`.
       - This is incorrect. The program should not print `-1` for all cases where `n != k`. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Case 2: `k < 2`**
   - If `k` is less than 2, the program prints an array of `n` elements, where each element is `j + 1` for `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - This is correct because if `k = 1`, the array should have exactly one sorted cyclic shift. The array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is itself.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` properly. It incorrectly prints `-1` for all such cases, even though there can be valid arrays that satisfy the conditions.

### Correctness: **False**
