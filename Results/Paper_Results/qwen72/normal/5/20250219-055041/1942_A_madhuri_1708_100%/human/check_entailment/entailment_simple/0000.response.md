### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads input from `open(0)`, which is a way to read from standard input in Python. It processes each line of input starting from the second line (ignoring the first line which contains the number of test cases).
   - The input is split into two integers `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Conditions and Output:**
   - **Case 1: `k >= 2`**
     - **Subcase 1: `n == k`**
       - If `n` is equal to `k`, the function prints `k` repeated `k` times. This is correct because if `n == k`, the array can be a constant array (e.g., `[k, k, ..., k]`), and all cyclic shifts will be sorted.
     - **Subcase 2: `n != k`**
       - If `n` is not equal to `k`, the function prints `-1`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of constructing an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `n != k`.

   - **Case 2: `k < 2`**
     - If `k` is less than 2, the function prints the sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. This is correct because if `k == 1`, the array can be constructed such that only one cyclic shift is sorted (e.g., `[1, 2, ..., n]`), and if `k == 0`, no array can satisfy the condition, but the function does not handle this case explicitly.

3. **Missing Cases:**
   - The function does not handle the case where `k == 1` and `n > 1` correctly. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 1`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3]`, but the function would print `-1` in this case.
   - The function does not handle the case where `k == 0` and `n > 1` at all. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 0`, the function should print `-1` because no array can have exactly 0 sorted cyclic shifts.

4. **General Solution:**
   - For `k == 1` and `n > 1`, a valid array can be constructed as `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - For `k == 0` and `n > 1`, the function should print `-1` because no such array exists.
   - For `k > 1` and `n > k`, a valid array can be constructed by repeating a sequence of `k` distinct numbers followed by a larger number that ensures only `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not handle all the necessary cases and outputs `-1` in situations where a valid array can be constructed.

**Correctness: **False****

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that handles all the necessary cases:

```python
def solve(n, k):
    if k == 0 and n > 1:
        print(-1)
    elif k == 1:
        print(*[i for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    elif k > 1:
        if n == k:
            print(*[k for j in range(k)])
        elif n > k:
            print(*([1] * (n - k) + [i for i in range(1, k + 1)]))
        else:
            print(-1)

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Process each test case
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    solve(n, k)
```

This corrected program ensures that all possible cases are handled correctly.
