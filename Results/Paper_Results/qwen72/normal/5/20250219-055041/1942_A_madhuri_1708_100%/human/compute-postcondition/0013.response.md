Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `[*open(0)][1:]` is a list containing at least two elements.
2. `s` is the second element of this list.
3. `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces.
4. `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces.
5. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` and `k` are now the integer values of the first and second parts of `s` split by spaces, respectively.
6. If `k` is less than 2, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List Creation**: `[*open(0)][1:]` creates a list from the file descriptor 0 (standard input) and removes the first element. This list contains at least two elements.
2. **Second Element**: `s` is assigned the second element of this list.
3. **Splitting `s`**: `s` is split by spaces, and the first part is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`, and the second part is converted to an integer and assigned to `k`.
4. **Condition Check**: If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integer values of the first and second parts of `s` split by spaces, respectively. If `k` is less than 2, `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
5. **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` creates a list of `k` elements, each element being `k`.
6. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement unpacks this list and prints each element.

### Determining the Output:
- If `k` is less than 2, the list comprehension will not generate any elements because `range(k)` will be an empty range. Therefore, nothing will be printed.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the list comprehension will generate a list of `k` elements, each being `k`. The `print` statement will unpack this list and print each `k` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
- If `k` is less than 2:
  Output: **(nothing)**
- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2:
  Output: **k k ... k (k times)**

To summarize:
Output: **k k ... k (k times) (where k is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces, and k is greater than or equal to 2)**

If `k` is less than 2, the output will be:
Output: **(nothing)**
