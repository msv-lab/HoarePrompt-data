The function `solve` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem description.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and returns a value based on these parameters.**
