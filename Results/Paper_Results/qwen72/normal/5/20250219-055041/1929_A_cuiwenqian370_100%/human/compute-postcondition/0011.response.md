The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`. The other variables (`t`, `index`, `n`, `array`) are not directly modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `index` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(array)`, `n` is the integer value of the second element in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the third element in `data` (i.e., `data[2:2 + n]` converted to integers).**
