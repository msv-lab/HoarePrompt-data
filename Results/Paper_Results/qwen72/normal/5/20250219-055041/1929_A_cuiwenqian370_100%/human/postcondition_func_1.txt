The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It applies the function `func_1` to each test case's array of integers and collects the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result in the list. After the function concludes, `t` remains the integer value of the first element in the input data (1 <= t <= 500), and `results` is a list containing `t` return values from `func_1`. The function does not return any value.
