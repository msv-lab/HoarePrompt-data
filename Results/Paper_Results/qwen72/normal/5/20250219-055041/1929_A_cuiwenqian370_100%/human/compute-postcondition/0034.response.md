The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a predefined set of inputs, specifically a list `data` containing strings that represent integers, and an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. Each test case in `data` starts with an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It returns a result for each of the `t` test cases based on the provided inputs.**
