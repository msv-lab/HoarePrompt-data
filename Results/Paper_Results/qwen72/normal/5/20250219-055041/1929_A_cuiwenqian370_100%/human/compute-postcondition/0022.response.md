Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 498, `index` is `4 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(array)` and the value of `result`, `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `3 + 2*n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `index` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**

Explanation:
- The code `array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the `array` variable.
- `array` is now a list of `n` integers, starting from the element at position `index` in `data`.
- The values of `t`, `index`, `results`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged.
- The updated `array` is used to compute `result` in the next step, but this is not part of the current code snippet, so `result` remains as the return value of `func_1(array)`.
