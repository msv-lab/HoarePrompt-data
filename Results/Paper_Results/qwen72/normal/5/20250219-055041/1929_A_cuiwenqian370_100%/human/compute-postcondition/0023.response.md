Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 498, `index` is `4 + 3*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(array)` and the value of `result`, `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `3 + 2*n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `4 + 2*n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**

Explanation:
- `index` was initially `4 + 2*n`.
- The code `index += n` increments `index` by `n`, so the new value of `index` is `4 + 2*n + n`, which simplifies to `4 + 3*n`.
- The values of `t`, `results`, `n`, `array`, and `result` remain unchanged.
