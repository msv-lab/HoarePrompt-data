Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500.
   - `results` is a list containing at least three return values of `func_1(array)`.
   - `result` is the third element of `results`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The variable `t` is derived from the first element of the list `data` and is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
   - The list `results` contains at least three elements, each of which is a return value from the function `func_1(array)`.
   - The variable `result` is specifically the third element of the list `results`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `result` is the third element of `results`, and `results` contains return values from `func_1(array)`, the value of `result` will be the return value of the third call to `func_1(array)`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the third return value of `func_1(array)`.

Output: **result (where result is the third return value of `func_1(array)`)**
