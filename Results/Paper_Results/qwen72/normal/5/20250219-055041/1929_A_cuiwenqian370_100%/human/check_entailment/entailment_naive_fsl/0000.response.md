Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array has duplicate elements correctly. The problem description requires the maximum beauty of the array, which is achieved by sorting the array in non-decreasing order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the `func_1` function calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which is not the correct way to compute the maximum beauty as defined in the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is 1, but the program will output 4 because it calculates the sum of absolute differences:
```
|4 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
```
However, the program will output:
```
|4 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
```
But if we rearrange the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, the beauty would be:
```
(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
```
The correct approach should be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences without taking the absolute value, as the problem specifies the beauty as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for `i` from 2 to `n`.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty
```
