Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 498, `index` is `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(array)` and the value of `result`, `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `3 + 2*n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `3 + n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the element at the position `3 + 2*n` in the list `data`.
- The other variables (`t`, `index`, `results`, `array`, and `result`) remain unchanged, but the new value of `n` will affect the calculation of `index` and the definition of `array` in subsequent steps.
