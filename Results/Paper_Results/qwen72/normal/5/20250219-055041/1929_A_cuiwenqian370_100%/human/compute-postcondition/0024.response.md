Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 498, `index` is `4 + 3*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(array)` and the value of `result`, `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `3 + 2*n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `4 + 2*n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**

The code `result = func_1(array)` updates the value of `result` to the return value of `func_1(array)`. Since `result` was already defined as the return value of `func_1(array)`, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
