Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. The problem description defines the beauty of the array as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key point here is that the array should be sorted in non-decreasing order to maximize the beauty. This is because sorting the array ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are non-negative and maximized.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array in non-decreasing order using `array.sort()`. This is correct because sorting the array ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are non-negative and maximized.

2. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The function `func_1` then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements: `beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])`.
   - However, the problem specifies that the beauty should be the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value. Since the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, \(a_i \geq a_{i-1}\) for all \(i\), and thus \(a_i - a_{i-1} \geq 0\). Therefore, taking the absolute value does not change the result.

3. **Handling Duplicate Elements**:
   - The original assessment claims that the program does not handle duplicate elements correctly. However, this is not true. When the array is sorted, duplicate elements will be adjacent, and the difference between them will be 0. This is consistent with the problem's definition of beauty, as \(a_i - a_{i-1} = 0\) for duplicate elements.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     3 4 3 3
     ```
     The sorted array will be `[3, 3, 3, 4]`. The beauty is calculated as:
     \[
     (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
     \]
     This matches the expected output.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the results. The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program is correct as it stands.

Final: **True**
