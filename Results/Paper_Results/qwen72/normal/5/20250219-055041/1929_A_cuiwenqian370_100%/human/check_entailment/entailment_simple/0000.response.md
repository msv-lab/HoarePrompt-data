### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, the problem requires maximizing the beauty, which is not necessarily achieved by sorting the array in ascending order. The maximum beauty is actually achieved by sorting the array in descending order and then calculating the differences.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it sorts the array in ascending order, which minimizes the beauty rather than maximizing it.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The state of the program is correctly described, and the function prints the results for each test case.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in descending order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.
   - The correct implementation of `func_1` should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(array):
         array.sort(reverse=True)
         beauty = 0
         for i in range(1, len(array)):
             beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
         return beauty
     ```

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it sorts the array in ascending order, which minimizes the beauty. The correct approach is to sort the array in descending order to maximize the beauty.

### Correctness:
**False**
