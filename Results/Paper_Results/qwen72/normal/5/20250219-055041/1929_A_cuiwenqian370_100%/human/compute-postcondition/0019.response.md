The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is in the range 1 <= t <= 499. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, but it still needs to be in the range 1 <= t <= 499 to ensure the loop can continue.

State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 0 <= t <= 498, `index` is `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(array)` and the value of `result` (which is the return value of `func_1(array)`), `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `2 + n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `3 + n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**

However, to be precise and adhere to the original condition that `t` must be in the range 1 <= t <= 499 for the loop to execute, we should adjust the state as follows:

State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 498, `index` is `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(array)` and the value of `result` (which is the return value of `func_1(array)`), `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `2 + n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `3 + n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**
