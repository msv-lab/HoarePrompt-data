Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500.
   - `results` is a list containing at least two return values of `func_1(array)`.
   - `result` is the second element of `results`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `t` is determined by the first element in the list `data`, and it is guaranteed to be an integer within the range 1 to 500.
   - The list `results` contains at least two elements, each of which is the return value of the function `func_1(array)`.
   - The variable `result` is the second element of the list `results`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the second element of the list `results`.
   - Since `results` contains return values from `func_1(array)`, the exact value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the input `array`.

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **result (where result is the second element of the list `results`, and each element in `results` is a return value of `func_1(array)`)**
