Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `index` is `1 + t + t*n`, `results` is a list containing `t` return values of `func_1(array)`, `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `1 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `2 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list containing at least one return value of `func_1(array)`, `result` is the first element of `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list containing at least two return values of `func_1(array)`, `result` is the second element of `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list containing at least three return values of `func_1(array)`, `result` is the third element of `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
