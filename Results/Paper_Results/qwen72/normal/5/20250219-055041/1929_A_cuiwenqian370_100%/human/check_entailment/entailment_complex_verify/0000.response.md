Reasoning: The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the case where the array has duplicate elements correctly. However, the explanation provided in the original assessment is slightly misleading. The issue is not with the handling of duplicate elements per se, but with the method used to calculate the beauty of the array.

The problem specifies that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`. This means that the beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, without taking the absolute value. The `func_1` function, however, calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which is not the correct way to compute the maximum beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is 1, but the program will output 4 because it calculates the sum of absolute differences:
```
|4 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
```
However, the program will output:
```
|4 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
```
But if we rearrange the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, the beauty would be:
```
(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
```
The correct approach should be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences without taking the absolute value, as the problem specifies the beauty as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for `i` from 2 to `n`.

The corrected version of `func_1` provided in the original assessment is indeed correct:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty
```

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue and providing the correct solution.

Final: **False**
