Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not fully solve the problem as described. The logic in the function `func_1` only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The correct logic should consider whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even, as each move can either add or remove a cube, and the parity of the number of moves determines the final height of the tower.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is the correct condition to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
