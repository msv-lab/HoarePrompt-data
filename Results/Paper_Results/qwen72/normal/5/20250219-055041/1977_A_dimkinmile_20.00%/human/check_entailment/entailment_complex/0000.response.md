Reasoning:

The program provided is intended to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. However, the logic within the function `func_1` is flawed. The function simply checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise. This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the nature of the moves (adding or removing a cube).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- Each move can either add or remove a cube.
- After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any odd number if `n` is odd, and any even number if `n` is even.
- Therefore, the correct condition to check is whether `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).

The provided program does not check the parity of `n` and `m`, and instead only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. This is insufficient to determine the correct outcome for all cases.

For example:
- In the test case `2 4`, the program will print "No" because `2` is not greater than or equal to `4`, but the correct answer should be "Yes" because it is possible to end up with exactly 4 cubes after 2 moves (e.g., add 1 cube, add 1 cube).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
