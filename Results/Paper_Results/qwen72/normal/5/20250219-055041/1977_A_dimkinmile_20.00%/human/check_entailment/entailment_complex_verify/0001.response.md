Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, which represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**:
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
   - If `n >= m`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "No".

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic is based on the idea that Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
   - While it is true that `n` must be at least `m` for Nikita to have enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes, this alone is not sufficient to determine the correctness.
   - The critical aspect that is missing is the parity consideration. Nikita can only end up with an even number of cubes if the number of moves `n` is even, and an odd number of cubes if `n` is odd. This is because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes in the tower.

5. **Parity Consideration**:
   - To correctly determine if Nikita can end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to check if the parity of `n` and `m` is the same.
   - If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), then it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.
   - If `n` and `m` have different parities, it is not possible.

6. **Validation of Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - However, the annotations do not address the parity issue, which is crucial for the correctness of the program.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly handle the parity condition.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Final: **False**
