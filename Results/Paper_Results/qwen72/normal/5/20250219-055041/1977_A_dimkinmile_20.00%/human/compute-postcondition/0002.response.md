The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string 'Yes'. The precondition states that `n` and `m` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `m` in any way. It simply prints the string 'Yes' regardless of the values of `n` and `m`.

Output: **Yes**
