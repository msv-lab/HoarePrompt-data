Postcondition: **`n` retains its initial integer value, `k` is decreased by 1, `f` is decreased by 1, `_` is not explicitly initialized but the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user sorted in descending order, `x` is the integer value at the index `f` in the sorted list `a`, and the integer value at the index `k` in the sorted list `a` is greater than `x`.**
