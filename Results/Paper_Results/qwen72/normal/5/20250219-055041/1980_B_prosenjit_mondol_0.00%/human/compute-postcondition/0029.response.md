Output State: **`n`, `f`, and `k` are reassigned to new integer values provided by the user, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user and is now sorted in descending order, `x` is now equal to `a[f]` after `a` has been sorted in descending order. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` remains greater than `x`. If `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`. The previous values of `n`, `f`, and `k` are no longer valid.**
