Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input by the user, `f` is an integer input by the user and is now decreased by 2, `k` is an integer input by the user and is now decreased by 2, `_` is not explicitly initialized but the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user and is now sorted in descending order, `x` is now equal to `a[f]` after `a` has been sorted in descending order. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, then the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is executed.***
