Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` retains its initial integer value.
- `k` is decreased by 1.
- `f` is decreased by 1.
- `_` is not explicitly initialized but the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user, sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the integer value at the index `f` in the sorted list `a`.
- `a[k]` is less than `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`n`**: This variable retains its initial integer value. Its specific value is not provided, but it does not affect the `print` statement.
2. **`k`**: This variable is decreased by 1. The exact value of `k` is not provided, but it is used in the condition `a[k] < x`.
3. **`f`**: This variable is also decreased by 1. The exact value of `f` is not provided, but it is used to index the list `a` to get `x`.
4. **`_`**: This variable is not explicitly initialized, but the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. This implies that the loop condition is met, but the value of `_` itself is not relevant to the `print` statement.
5. **`a`**: This is a list of integers input by the user, sorted in descending order. The exact values of the integers are not provided, but the list is sorted such that the first element is the largest, the second element is the second largest, and so on.
6. **`x`**: This is the integer value at the index `f` in the sorted list `a`. Since `f` is decreased by 1, `x` will be the value at the index `f - 1` in the sorted list `a`.
7. **`a[k]`**: This is the integer value at the index `k` in the sorted list `a`. Since `k` is decreased by 1, `a[k]` will be the value at the index `k - 1` in the sorted list `a`.
8. **Condition**: The condition `a[k] < x` is true, meaning the value at index `k - 1` in the sorted list `a` is less than the value at index `f - 1` in the sorted list `a`.

Given that the condition `a[k] < x` is true, the `print` statement will execute and print 'YES'.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
