To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, and `num` will start from 1 and iterate up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5).
- Each integer `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`.
- Each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times.
- `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.
- `max_score` is 0.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, and `num` will start from 1.

State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`, `max_score` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `num` is 1**
