The value of `max_score` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `max_score` is either 1 or 2 based on the conditions provided in the initial state. If `num` is a key in the dictionary `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is 2, then `max_score` was initially 2 and becomes 3. Otherwise, `max_score` was initially 1 and becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`a`, `count_a`, `n`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`. `n` must be at least 3, `num` is 3. If `num` is a key in the dictionary `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is 2, then `max_score` is 3. Otherwise, `max_score` is 2.**
