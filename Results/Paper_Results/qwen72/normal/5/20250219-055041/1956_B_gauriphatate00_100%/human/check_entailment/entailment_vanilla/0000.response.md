### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Cards:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the maximum number of points you can get.
   - It initializes a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and updates the count for each card in the dictionary.

3. **Calculating Maximum Score:**
   - The program initializes `max_score` to 0.
   - It iterates through the integers from 1 to `n` and checks if each integer is in the dictionary `count_a`.
   - If the integer appears exactly twice in your hand (`count_a[num] == 2`), it increments `max_score` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result of each test case to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result.

### Analysis:

- **Optimal Play:**
  - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means she will always play a card that matches a card on the table if possible, and if not, she will play a card that does not match any card on the table.
  - You can only score points if you play a card that matches a card already on the table. The only way this can happen is if you have both cards of a particular number in your hand, and Nene does not have the matching card.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The program correctly identifies the maximum number of points you can get by counting the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand. This is because if you have both cards of a particular number, you can score a point by playing the second card after the first one is on the table.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 and you have a single card (which can only appear once).
  - It also handles the case where you have no cards that appear twice, resulting in a score of 0.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally. The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
