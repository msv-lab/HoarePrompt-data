Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) and must have at least one element, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, `count_a` is a dictionary. If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, the value of `count_a[num]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is added as a key in `count_a` with the value 1.***
