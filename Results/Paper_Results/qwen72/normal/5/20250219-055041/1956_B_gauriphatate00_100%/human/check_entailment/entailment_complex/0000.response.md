### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - You and Nene are playing a card game with a deck of 2n cards, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player gets n cards.
   - The game proceeds in 2n turns, with each player taking n turns, starting with you.
   - You score a point if you play a card that matches a card already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the maximum number of points you can score.
   - The function counts the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice. This is because if an integer appears twice in your hand, you can play the first card without scoring a point, and the second card will score a point when played.
   - The function does not consider the optimal play of Nene, but it correctly identifies the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally.

3. **Optimal Play:**
   - If an integer appears exactly twice in your hand, you can play the first card without scoring a point, and the second card will score a point.
   - If an integer appears only once in your hand, you cannot score a point for that integer.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, but the function correctly identifies the maximum points you can score by playing optimally.

4. **Function Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
   - The function does not need to simulate the entire game because the maximum points you can score are solely determined by the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where no integer appears exactly twice (returning 0).
   - The function handles the case where all integers in your hand appear exactly twice (returning the count of such integers).

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly identifies the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given the constraints and the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
