Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`, `max_score` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `num` is 1, `num` is a key in the dictionary `count_a`, and the current value of `count_a[num]` is 2.**

The value of `max_score` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
