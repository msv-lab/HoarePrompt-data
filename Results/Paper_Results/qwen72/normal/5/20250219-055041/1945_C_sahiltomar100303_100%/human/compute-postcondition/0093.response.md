Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `right + 1`, `n` must be greater than `right`, `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`, `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`.**

The value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1, while the values of all other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid.
