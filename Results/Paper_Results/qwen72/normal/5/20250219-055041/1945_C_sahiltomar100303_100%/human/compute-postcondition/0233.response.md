Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid + 2`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`, `trightOne` must satisfy the loop condition.**

The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
