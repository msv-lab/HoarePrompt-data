Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `leftMove` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 4 if the first character of `s` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `leftOne` is incremented by 1.
- If the first character of `s` is not '0', `leftOne` was initially 3, so after the increment, `leftOne` is 4.
- If the first character of `s` is '0', `leftOne` was initially 0, so after the increment, `leftOne` is 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
