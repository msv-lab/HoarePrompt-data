Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `leftZero` remains less than `(left + 1) // 2`, and `rightOne` remains less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`**

The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1, but all other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. The new value of `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, and it still remains less than `(left + 1) // 2`.
