Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid - 1`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`. If the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` minus 1, and `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`, while `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`.**
