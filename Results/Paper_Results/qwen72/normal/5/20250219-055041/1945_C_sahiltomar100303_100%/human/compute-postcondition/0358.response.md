Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `n // 2 + 1`. If the character at index `right - 1` in the string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is `tleftZero + 1` and `rightZero` is `trightZero - 1`. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is `trightZero`, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is `trightOne - 1`, and `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `right` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `n // 2 + 1`.
- All other variables (`i`, `mid`, `n`, `left`, `leftMove`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`) retain their previous values or conditions.
- The condition for updating `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, and `tleftOne` based on the character at index `right - 1` in the string `s` remains the same.
