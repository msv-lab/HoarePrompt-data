Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `rightZero` to 0. Since this is the only change, the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is still an input integer, `s` is still an input string, `mid` is still `n // 2`, and `leftZero` is still 0. The new variable `rightZero` is also 0.
