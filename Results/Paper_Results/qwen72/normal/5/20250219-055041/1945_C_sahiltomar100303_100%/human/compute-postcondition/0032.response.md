Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is either 0, 1, or 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is either 2 or 3, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is either 1 or 2, `trightOne` is 0, and `leftZero` is either 1, 2, or 3. If `s[i]` is not '0', the values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` depend on the first two characters of `s`: if the first character is '0' and the second character is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, and `trightOne` is 0; if the first character is '0' and the second character is not '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2, and `trightOne` is 0; if the first character is not '0' and the second character is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 3, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 3, and `trightOne` is 0; if the first character is not '0' and the second character is not '0', then `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 3, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 3, and `trightOne` is 0.***
