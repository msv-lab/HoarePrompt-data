The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `mid`, and `n`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables change and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue executing.

1. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid - 1`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `mid`.

2. **Variable `mid`**: This variable remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.

3. **Variable `n`**: This variable also remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.

4. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. After the previous iteration, `i` is `mid - 1`, and the loop condition `i < n` must still hold true. For the next iteration, `i` will be `mid`, so the condition `mid < n` must be true for the loop to execute again.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`**.
