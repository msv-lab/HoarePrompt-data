Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is greater than 0, `right` is `n`, and `right` equals `n`. `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the second half to the first half, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` plus the number of '1's moved from the second half to the first half, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` minus the number of '0's moved to the first half, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` minus the number of '1's moved to the first half. If `left` is not 0, the state remains unchanged. If `left` is 0, then if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `left` is set to 0; otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` remains greater than 0.***
