The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `mid`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `mid` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, and `trightOne` is 0. If the first character of `s` is '0' and the second character is not '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, and `trightOne` is 0. If the first character of `s` is not '0' and the second character is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2, and `trightOne` is 0. If the first character of `s` is not '0' and the second character is not '0', then `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 2, and `trightOne` is 0.**
