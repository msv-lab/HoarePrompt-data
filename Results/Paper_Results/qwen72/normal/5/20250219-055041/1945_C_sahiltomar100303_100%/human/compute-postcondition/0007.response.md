Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0.**

The variable `leftOne` is initialized to 0, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `leftOne` being 0.
