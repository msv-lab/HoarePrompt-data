Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's in `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's in `s`, `left` is `n // 2`.**

The variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is `n // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions that `mid` is greater than 0 and `n` is greater than `mid` are still valid. The counts of '0's and '1's in the second half of `s` and the total counts of '0's and '1's in `s` are also unchanged.
