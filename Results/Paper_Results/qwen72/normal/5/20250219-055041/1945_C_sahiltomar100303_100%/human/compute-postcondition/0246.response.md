Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the second half to the first half, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` plus the number of '1's moved from the second half to the first half, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` minus the number of '0's moved to the first half, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` minus the number of '1's moved to the first half, and `right` is equal to `n`. Additionally, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.**
