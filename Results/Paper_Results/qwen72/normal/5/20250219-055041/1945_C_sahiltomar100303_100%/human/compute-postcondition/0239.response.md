Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s` plus the number of '0's moved from the second half to the first half, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` plus the number of '1's moved from the second half to the first half, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s` minus the number of '0's moved to the first half, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s` minus the number of '1's moved to the first half.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `right` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has processed all characters from the second half of the string `s`.
- The variables `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` will have been incremented by the number of '0's and '1's, respectively, that were moved from the second half of `s` to the first half.
- The variables `trightZero` and `trightOne` will have been decremented by the number of '0's and '1's, respectively, that were moved from the first half of `s` to the second half.
- The loop condition will no longer be satisfied, meaning that either `tleftZero` is no longer less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` is no longer less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`.
