Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `mid`, `leftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 1, `tleftZero` is the number of '0' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the number of '1' characters in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is 1.** 

The value of `trightOne` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
