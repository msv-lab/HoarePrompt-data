Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `s` is a new input string, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `trightZero` is the number of '0's in the second half of `s`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `trightOne` is the number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `mid`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `leftMove = 0` sets the variable `leftMove` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
