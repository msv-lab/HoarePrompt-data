Output State: **`i` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `mid`, `s[i]` is not '0', `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`, `trightOne` is `trightOne + 1`**

The value of `trightOne` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so `i` is still `mid - 1`, `mid` is still `n // 2` and is greater than 0, `n` is still greater than `mid`, and `s[i]` is still not '0'. The value of `rightOne` is also still `rightOne + 1`.
