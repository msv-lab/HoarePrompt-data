Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not account for the correct minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Initial Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to make all elements of the array equal with the minimum cost.
   - The cost of the operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles, where `i` and `j` are the indices of the subarray to be modified.

2. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program attempts to find the longest prefix and suffix where all elements are the same and then calculates the cost based on the remaining elements.
   - However, this approach does not consider the optimal value `x` to which the subarray should be set. The program assumes that the optimal value is either the first or last element, which is not always correct.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following:
     - If all elements are already the same, the cost is `0`.
     - Otherwise, find the most frequent element in the array. The optimal strategy is to set the subarray to this most frequent element.
     - Calculate the cost of setting the subarray to the most frequent element by finding the minimum cost to cover all elements that are not already equal to this value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = Counter(arr)
    
    # Find the most frequent element
    most_common_value, most_common_count = freq.most_common(1)[0]
    
    # Calculate the cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent element
    cost = n - most_common_count
    
    return cost
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as described.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Edge Case**: If the array has only one element, the cost is `0` because it is already equal.
   - **Frequency Count**: Use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the array.
   - **Most Frequent Element**: Identify the most frequent element and its count.
   - **Cost Calculation**: The cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent element is `n - most_common_count`, where `n` is the length of the array and `most_common_count` is the count of the most frequent element.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for all test cases.
