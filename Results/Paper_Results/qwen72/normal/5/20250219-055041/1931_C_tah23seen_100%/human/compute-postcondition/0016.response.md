Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal. `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1. `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]` and `j` is greater than 0, or `j` is 0 if all elements in `arr` are equal.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be the largest index in the list `arr` where the element at `j` is different from the element at `j - 1`. If all elements in the list are the same, `j` will be 0. The other variables, `arr`, `i`, and `n`, remain unchanged from their initial states.
