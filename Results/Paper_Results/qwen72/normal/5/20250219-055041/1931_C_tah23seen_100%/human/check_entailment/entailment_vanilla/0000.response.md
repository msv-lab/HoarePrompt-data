Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to compute the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the current element is equal to the next element. This is to find the first position where the elements differ.
   - Similarly, it moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the current element is equal to the previous element. This is to find the last position where the elements differ.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it returns the maximum of `j - i - 1` and `0`. This is because if the first and last elements are the same, the array is already partially equal, and we only need to consider the middle part.
   - If the first and last elements are different, it returns the maximum of `min(n - i - 1, j)` and `0`. This is to find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be changed to make all elements equal.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic of moving the pointers `i` and `j` to find the first and last positions where the elements differ is correct.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, the program correctly calculates the length of the segment that needs to be changed to make all elements equal.
   - If the first and last elements are different, the program correctly calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be changed.
   - However, the program does not consider the case where the array is already entirely equal. In such a case, the cost should be `0`, and the program correctly handles this by returning `0` when `i` and `j` converge to the same element or when the array is already equal.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array is already entirely equal by returning `0`.
   - The program handles the case where the array has only one element by returning `0`.
   - The program handles the case where the array has two elements by correctly calculating the cost.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all the described cases and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
