To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `i < len(arr) - 1` and `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

1. **Condition 1: `i < len(arr) - 1`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(arr) - 1` is `n - 1` (since `n` is equal to the length of `arr`).
   - For `i < len(arr) - 1` to be true, `len(arr)` must be greater than 1. This is because if `len(arr)` is 1, then `len(arr) - 1` is 0, and `i` (which is 0) is not less than 0.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**
   - `i` is 0, so we need to check if `arr[0] == arr[1]`.
   - This condition depends on the values of the first two elements in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is equal to the length of `arr`.
- `j` is equal to `n - 1`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once:
- `len(arr)` must be greater than 1 (so `i < len(arr) - 1` is true).
- `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]` (so `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is true).

Since `len(arr)` is already constrained to be at least 1, we need to ensure it is at least 2. Additionally, we need to ensure that `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[1]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). `i` is 0. `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1. `j` is equal to `n - 1`. `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.**
