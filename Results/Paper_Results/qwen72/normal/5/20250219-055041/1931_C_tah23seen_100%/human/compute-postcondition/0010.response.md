The variables in the loop head are `j` and the elements of `arr`. The loop condition is `j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be greater than 0, and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
- `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is equal to `n - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute the first time:
- `j` must be greater than 0, which is already true since `j = n - 1` and `n > 1`.
- `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

Since `j` is already greater than 0, we need to ensure that `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`. This means that the last two elements of `arr` must be equal.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal. `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1. `j` is equal to `n - 1` and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`**
