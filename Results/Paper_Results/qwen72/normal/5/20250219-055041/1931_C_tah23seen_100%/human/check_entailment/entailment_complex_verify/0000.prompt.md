You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal. `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1. `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]` and `j` is greater than 0, or `j` is 0 if all elements in `arr` are equal.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns an integer. It calculates the maximum of 0 and the difference between the largest index `j` of a non-repeating element from the end of the list and the first index `i` of a non-repeating element from the start of the list, minus 1. If all elements in `arr` are equal, it returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of the length of the list minus the first index `i` minus 1, and the largest index `j` of a non-repeating element from the end, which is 0 in this case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the minimum cost to make all elements equal is achieved by selecting a value that is not at the start or end of the array. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`. The correct answer should be 1 (by setting the middle three elements to 1 or 2), but the program will return 0, as it incorrectly assumes that the minimum cost is always related to the first or last element being the same.
