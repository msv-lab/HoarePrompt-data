Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 1, `num` is 1, `final` is a list containing the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2` (which is now 0 since `list2` contains one element), `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of words from the user input `b` that must have at least 1 word, `str` is the first word in `list1`, `i` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first word in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `list2.append(int(str))` adds the integer value of `str` to the list `list2`.
- `str` is the first word in `list1`, which is a list of words from the user input `b`.
- Therefore, `list2` now contains the integer value of the first word in `list1`.
- The other variables (`n`, `num`, `final`, `s`, `list1`, `str`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged or their initial conditions are still valid.
