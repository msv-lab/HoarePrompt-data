Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input integers are not all distinct. Specifically, the program sorts the list and then sums every other element starting from the first. This approach works correctly when all numbers are distinct, but it fails when there are repeated numbers. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
2
1 1 2 2
```
The expected output is 3 because the optimal moves are:
- Choose 1 and 1, add 1 to the score.
- Choose 2 and 2, add 2 to the score.
- Total score: 1 + 2 = 3.

However, the program will output 2 because it will sum the first and third elements (1 and 2) after sorting, which are not the minimum values of the pairs.

To fix this, the program should sum the first `n` elements of the sorted list, as these will always be the minimum values of the pairs. Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2) // 2):
            s = s + list2[i]
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
```
