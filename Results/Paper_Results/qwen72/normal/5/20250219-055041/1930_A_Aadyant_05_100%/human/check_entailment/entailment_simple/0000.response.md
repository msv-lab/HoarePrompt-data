### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal for handling test cases. However, it uses `input()` to read the number of test cases and the integers for each test case, which is a common practice in competitive programming where input is read from standard input.

2. **Loop for Test Cases:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and initializes an empty list `final` to store the results of each test case.
   - It then iterates over the range `0` to `n-1` to process each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a score `s` to `0`.
   - It reads the number of integers `a` (which should be `2n`), but this value is not used in the subsequent code.
   - It reads the actual integers as a single string `b` and splits it into a list of strings `list1`.
   - It converts each string in `list1` to an integer and appends it to `list2`.
   - It sorts `list2` in ascending order.

4. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The function then iterates over the sorted list `list2` in steps of 2, adding the elements at even indices to the score `s`.
   - This approach is correct because, in a sorted list, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are the smaller elements in each pair when the list is divided into pairs.

5. **Storing and Printing Results:**
   - The score `s` for each test case is appended to the `final` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the function prints each score in `final`.

### Issues:
- **Redundant Variable `a`:** The variable `a` is read but not used in the subsequent code. This is a minor issue but could be confusing.
- **Variable Naming:** The variable `str` is used as a loop variable, which shadows the built-in `str` type. This is a bad practice but does not affect the correctness of the program.
- **Input Handling:** The function assumes that the input is provided in a specific format and does not handle invalid inputs. However, the problem description guarantees valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issues mentioned, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score for each test case by always selecting the smaller element in each pair from the sorted list. The program will produce the correct output for valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
