Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of the first word in `list1`, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `list1` is a list of words from `b` split by whitespace that must have at least one word, `str` is the first word in `list1`**

Explanation:
- The code `list2.append(int(str))` adds the integer value of `str` to `list2`.
- `str` is the first word in `list1`, and it is converted to an integer and appended to `list2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `num`, `final`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, and `str`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
