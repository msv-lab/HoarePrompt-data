Output State: **`n` must be an integer greater than 2, `num` is 2, `final` is a list containing the value of `s` (which is 0), `s` is 0, `list1` is a list of strings resulting from splitting `b` by spaces, `i` is -1, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all the strings in `list1`, `a` is the user input, `b` is the new user input.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains an integer greater than 2.
- The variable `num` remains 2.
- The variable `final` remains a list containing the value of `s`, which is 0.
- The variable `s` remains 0.
- The variable `list1` remains a list of strings resulting from splitting the input `b` by spaces.
- The variable `i` remains -1.
- The variable `list2` now contains the integer values of all the strings in `list1`.
- The variables `a` and `b` remain as the user inputs they were initially set to.
