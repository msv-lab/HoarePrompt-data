The value of `n` is assigned the result of `input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The value of `n` is now a string representing the user input. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer a_i in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. `n` is a string representing user input.**
