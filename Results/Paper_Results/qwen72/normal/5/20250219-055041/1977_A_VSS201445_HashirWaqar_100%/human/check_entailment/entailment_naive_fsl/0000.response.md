Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m` correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is less than `m`, it should be impossible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the program only checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. This means that for cases where `n < m`, the program will incorrectly output "NO" instead of "YES" when `n` and `m` are both odd or both even.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2 3
```
The program will output "NO" because `n` is less than `m`, but it should output "YES" because it is possible to build a tower with 3 cubes after 2 moves by first adding 2 cubes and then removing 1 cube, and then adding 2 more cubes. However, this is not a valid sequence of moves according to the problem description, which states that moves can only add or remove 1 cube at a time. Therefore, the correct output should be "NO" for this case, but the program's logic is flawed in handling such cases. 

A correct implementation should check if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` or if `n < m` and `n` and `m` are both odd or both even. However, since `n < m` should always result in "NO", the program is incorrect.
