Postcondition: ***`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference `(n - m)` is not divisible by 2.***
