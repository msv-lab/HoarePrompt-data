To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes, let's analyze the initial state and the condition provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user input.
   - `_` is 2, but this variable is not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.
   - The condition is that if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition checks two things:
     - `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
     - The difference `(n - m)` is an even number.
   - If both conditions are true, the condition is met.
   - If either condition is false, the condition is not met.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement will execute if the condition is met.
   - If the condition is not met, the `print` statement will not execute, and nothing will be printed.

Given the initial state and the condition, the `print('YES')` statement will only execute if both `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and `(n - m)` is an even number. Since the condition is not explicitly stated to be false, we assume it is true for the purpose of this task.

Output: **YES (where 'YES' is printed if the condition that `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is an even number is met)**
