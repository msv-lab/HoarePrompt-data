### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the tower in each move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 100.
   - Both `n` and `m` are between 1 and 100.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer from `0` to `n` (if all moves are adding cubes) or from `0` to `n` (if some moves are removing cubes).
   - The key is to check if `m` can be achieved by a combination of adding and removing cubes.
   - Each move can be either adding or removing a cube, so the difference between the number of cubes added and removed must be `m`.
   - The total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` (since you can't have more cubes than the number of moves).
   - The difference `n - m` must be even because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) cancels out, and the remaining moves must be all adds or all removes.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `n - m` is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func` processes a series of test cases provided through user input.
   - Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100).
   - For each test case, the function prints 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - The function handles up to 100 test cases, and the number of test cases is specified by the first user input.
   - After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.

6. **Verification:**
   - The conditions `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` are both necessary and sufficient to solve the problem.
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - If `n - m` is odd, it is impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes because the parity of the number of cubes would not match.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the problem description and constraints.

Final: **True**
