You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple or list containing two integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function should handle up to 100 test cases.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, and the final values of `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user input for the last iteration. For each iteration, if `n` was greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` was an even number, 'YES' was printed; otherwise, 'NO' was printed. The initial condition `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and the loop has executed exactly `int(input())` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a list of up to 100 test cases, where each test case is a tuple or list containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
