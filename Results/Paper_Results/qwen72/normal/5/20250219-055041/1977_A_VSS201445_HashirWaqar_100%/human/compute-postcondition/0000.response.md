The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer greater than 0. The state of `func` and the test cases are not directly related to the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
