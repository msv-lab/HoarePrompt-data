### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Conditions Analysis**:
   - **Condition 1**: `n >= m`
     - This ensures that Nikita has enough moves to build at least `m` cubes.
   - **Condition 2**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0`
     - This ensures that the number of moves left after building `m` cubes is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove a cube, and the total number of moves must be balanced to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `n = 3, m = 3`
     - `3 >= 3` is true.
     - `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` is true.
     - Output: 'YES'
   - **Test Case 2**: `n = 2, m = 4`
     - `2 >= 4` is false.
     - Output: 'NO'
   - **Test Case 3**: `n = 5, m = 3`
     - `5 >= 3` is true.
     - `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` is true.
     - Output: 'YES'

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` and `m` are both 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is less than `m` correctly by printing 'NO'.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The output is in the correct format as specified in the problem description (case-insensitive 'Yes' or 'No').

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Nikita can build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It handles all the given test cases and edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
