You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple or list containing two integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function should handle up to 100 test cases.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `_` is equal to `int(input()) - 1`, and the final values of `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user input for the last iteration. For each iteration, if `n` was greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` was an even number, 'YES' was printed; otherwise, 'NO' was printed. The initial condition `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and the loop has executed exactly `int(input())` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m` correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is less than `m`, it should be impossible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the program only checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. This means that for cases where `n < m`, the program will incorrectly output "NO" instead of "YES" when `n` and `m` are both odd or both even.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2 3
```
The program will output "NO" because `n` is less than `m`, but it should output "YES" because it is possible to build a tower with 3 cubes after 2 moves by first adding 2 cubes and then removing 1 cube, and then adding 2 more cubes. However, this is not a valid sequence of moves according to the problem description, which states that moves can only add or remove 1 cube at a time. Therefore, the correct output should be "NO" for this case, but the program's logic is flawed in handling such cases. 

A correct implementation should check if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` or if `n < m` and `n` and `m` are both odd or both even. However, since `n < m` should always result in "NO", the program is incorrect.
