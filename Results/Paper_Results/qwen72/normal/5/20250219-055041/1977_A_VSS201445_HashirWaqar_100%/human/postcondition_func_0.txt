The function `func` processes a series of test cases provided through user input. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). For each test case, the function prints 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles up to 100 test cases, and the number of test cases is specified by the first user input. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
