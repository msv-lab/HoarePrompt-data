Output State: **The program returns an empty list.** 

This means that after the loop has completed all iterations, and all conditions for returning a non-empty `res` were not met (i.e., no neighbor `nei` of `curr` resulted in a non-empty `res` from the `dfs` function and `node_v` is not in `set_res`), the function explicitly returns an empty list.
