Output State: **`_min_edge` is now equal to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` now contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` now contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `node_u` is `u`, `node_v` is -1, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method, and the current value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than the current value of `_min_edge` (before the update).**

In natural language, the output state is:
- `_min_edge` remains the same as `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`.
- `u`, `v`, and `w` are still assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration.
- `graph[u]` still contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements.
- `graph[v]` still contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements.
- `edges` is still a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 1 tuple.
- `i` is still `m-1`.
- `m` is still greater than or equal to 3.
- `n` and `m` are still assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration.
- `dsu` is still a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements.
- `node_u` is now equal to `u`.
- `node_v` remains -1.
- `parent_u` is still the parent of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method.
- `parent_v` is still the parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method.
- The current value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is still less than the current value of `_min_edge` (before the update).
