Output State: **`u` and `v` are now in the same connected component in `dsu`, `_min_edge` is updated to the minimum of `w` and the previous value of `_min_edge`, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to the new parent of `u` and `v` as determined by `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` respectively, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, and `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is updated to `w` if `w` is less than the current `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` operation merges the sets containing `u` and `v` and updates the minimum edge weight for the new set.
- `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component.
- `_min_edge` is updated to the minimum of `w` and the previous value of `_min_edge`.
- `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to the new parent of `u` and `v` as determined by `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` respectively.
- `node_u` is set to `u` and `node_v` is set to `v`.
- `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is updated to `w` if `w` is less than the current `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
