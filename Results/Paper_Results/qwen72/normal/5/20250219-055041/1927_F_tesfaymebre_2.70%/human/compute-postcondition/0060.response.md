To determine what will be printed by the `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations that lead to the values of `_min_edge` and `res`.

### Initial State:
1. `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
2. `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration.
3. `graph[u]` contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements.
4. `graph[v]` contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements.
5. `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w`.
6. `i` is 0.
7. `m` is greater than or equal to 3.
8. `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration.
9. `dsu` is a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) object initialized with `n + 1` elements.
10. `node_u` and `node_v` are the last nodes that were unioned.
11. `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among all the edges that were unioned.
12. `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **DSU Initialization**:
   - `dsu` is initialized with `n + 1` elements, meaning it starts with `n + 1` disjoint sets, each containing one element.

2. **Edge Processing**:
   - `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the edge weight `w`.
   - The code iterates over these edges, and for each edge `(w, u, v)`, it performs a union operation on `u` and `v` using the `dsu` object.
   - The last union operation will be on the smallest edge weight, which is stored in `_min_edge`.

3. **Node Union**:
   - `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes that were unioned in the last iteration of the edge processing loop.
   - Since `edges` is sorted in descending order, the last edge processed will have the smallest weight, and this weight will be stored in `_min_edge`.

4. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.
   - The `dfs` function likely traverses the graph starting from `node_u` and collects nodes in the `res` list.
   - The length of `res` will depend on the structure of the graph and the starting node `node_u`.

### Output Calculation:
- `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among all the edges that were unioned.
- `len(res)` is the number of nodes collected by the `dfs` function starting from `node_u`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and the specific nodes and edges are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and the operations performed.

Output: **_min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum edge weight among all the edges that were unioned, and len(res) is the number of nodes collected by the dfs function starting from node_u)**
