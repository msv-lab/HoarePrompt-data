Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `func_6()` has been called `test_cases` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` must have been at least as large as the number of times the loop ran, and the function `func_6()` has been called exactly `test_cases` times. Any other variables that were not part of the loop head or body remain unchanged.
