You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in the way it processes and identifies cycles. Specifically, the issue lies in the following part of the `func_6` function:

```python
if parent_u == parent_v:
    dsu.union(u, v, w)
    if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
        _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
        node_u = u
        node_v = v
```

This block of code is intended to identify a cycle and update the minimum edge weight of the cycle. However, it incorrectly performs a union operation when `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, which is not the correct approach. In a union-find (disjoint-set) structure, a union operation is typically performed when `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v` to merge two sets. Instead, when `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, it indicates that adding the edge `(u, v)` would form a cycle, and this should be the point where the cycle is identified and the minimum edge weight is updated.

Additionally, the `dfs` function is not correctly identifying the cycle. It should return the cycle path when a back edge is found, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly. Specifically, the condition `if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent` and the logic inside the `dfs` function are not robust enough to ensure that the cycle is correctly identified and returned.

To illustrate a case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
1
4 5
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
4 1 4
1 3 5
```

The expected output should be:

```
1 4
1 2 3 4
```

However, the program might not correctly identify this cycle or might output an incorrect cycle. The issue is that the union operation is performed incorrectly, and the `dfs` function does not correctly handle the cycle detection.
