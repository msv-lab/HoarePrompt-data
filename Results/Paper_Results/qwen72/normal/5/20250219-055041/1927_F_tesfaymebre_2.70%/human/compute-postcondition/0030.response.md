Output State: **`_min_edge` is now equal to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` now contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` now contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements, `node_u` is -1, `node_v` is -1, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method, and the current value of `parent_u` is no longer equal to the current value of `parent_v` because `u` and `v` have been unioned. Additionally, the current value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than the current value of `_min_edge` (before the update).**
