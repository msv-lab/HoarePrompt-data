Postcondition: ***`u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `graph[u]` now contains the list `[v, v, ..., v]` with `m` elements, `graph[v]` now contains the list `[u, u, ..., u]` with `m` elements, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order by the value of `w` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values by `func_3()` for each iteration, `dsu` is a DSU object initialized with `n + 1` elements. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `u` and `v` are in the same connected component, `_min_edge` remains `inf`, `node_u` and `node_v` remain -1, and `parent_u` is the same as `parent_v`. Otherwise, `u` and `v` are in different connected components, they are unioned, `node_u` is set to `u`, `node_v` is set to `v`, and if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged.***
