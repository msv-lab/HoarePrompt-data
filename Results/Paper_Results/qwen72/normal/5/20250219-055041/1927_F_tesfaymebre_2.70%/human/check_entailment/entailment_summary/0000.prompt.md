Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  Reads an integer value from the standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the processed integer value.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads the first line of input from the user via `sys.stdin`, removes any trailing whitespace from this line, and returns the modified line. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a string that represents the first line of input they provided, with any trailing whitespace removed.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. After the function concludes, the map object can be iterated over to access the integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into separate strings, converts these strings to integers, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter. The function returns this list of strings.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''

    (n, m) = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)

    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    print(*res)
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` initializes an empty graph and an empty list of edges, then populates the graph and edges based on `m` iterations of values provided by `func_3()`. It sorts the edges in descending order by weight, processes them using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure to union nodes and track the minimum edge weight, and finally performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a specific node to print the minimum edge weight and the number of nodes in the DFS traversal, followed by the nodes themselves. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The final state of the program includes a populated graph, a sorted list of edges, and the printed results of the minimum edge weight and the DFS traversal nodes.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def dfs(curr, parent, path):
    if colors[curr] == 1:

                return res
    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex in the DFS traversal), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function modifies the `colors` and `path` variables. If the current vertex `curr` is already being visited (i.e., `colors[curr]` is 1), it returns the current path. If a valid path is found from a neighbor of `curr` (excluding `parent` and any already fully visited vertices), and this path includes a specific node `node_v`, it returns this path. If no such path is found, it marks the current vertex as fully visited (i.e., `colors[curr]` is 2) and returns an empty list. The final state of the program is that the `colors` and `path` variables are updated, and the function returns either the current path or an empty list.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a number of test cases from `func_1` and then calls `func_6` that many times. After the function concludes, `func_6` has been called a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_1`. The function itself does not return any value.
