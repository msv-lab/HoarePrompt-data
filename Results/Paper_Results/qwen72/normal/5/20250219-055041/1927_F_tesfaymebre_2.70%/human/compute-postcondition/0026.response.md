Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `curr` and `parent` remain integers representing vertices in the graph, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is now 2, and `graph[curr]` has been fully iterated over. If any neighbor `nei` of `curr` (where `nei` is not `parent` and `colors[nei]` is not 2) resulted in a non-empty `res` from the `dfs` function and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the function returns `res`. Otherwise, the function returns an empty list.**
