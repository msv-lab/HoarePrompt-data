Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_3` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` for each test case.
   - `func_3` is used again to read the edges and their weights, which are stored in the `graph` and `edges` data structures.

2. **Graph and Edge Management**:
   - The graph is represented using a `defaultdict` of lists, and edges are stored as a list of tuples `(weight, u, v)`.
   - Edges are sorted in descending order by weight to ensure that the lightest edge is considered last.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization**:
   - A `DSU` object is created to manage the union-find operations.
   - The `DSU` class includes methods for finding the root of a set and unioning two sets, while also tracking the minimum edge weight in each set.

4. **Cycle Detection and Minimum Edge Weight**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the `DSU` to union the sets of the vertices connected by each edge.
   - If two vertices are already in the same set, it means a cycle is detected, and the minimum edge weight in this cycle is updated.
   - The program keeps track of the last detected cycle with the minimum edge weight.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Cycle Traversal**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the vertices in the cycle starting from `node_u`.
   - The `colors` array is used to mark the vertices as being visited (1) or fully visited (2).
   - The function returns the path of the cycle if a cycle is found, otherwise, it returns an empty list.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices in the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
- **Cycle Detection Logic**:
  - The cycle detection logic in `func_6` is incorrect. The program should detect a cycle when two vertices are in the same set and then find the cycle using the `dfs` function. However, the current logic only updates the minimum edge weight and does not correctly identify the cycle.
  - The `dfs` function is called with `node_u` and `node_v` as part of the cycle, but the logic inside `dfs` does not ensure that the cycle is correctly identified and returned.

- **DFS Logic**:
  - The `dfs` function is supposed to return the cycle, but the current implementation does not handle the cycle detection correctly. It should return the cycle when it encounters a vertex that is already in the path (i.e., `colors[curr] == 1`), but it does not do so.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly identify and return the vertices of the cycle with the minimum edge weight. The cycle detection and DFS logic are flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
