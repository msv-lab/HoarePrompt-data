Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `p1` and `p2` are undefined because `coord` now contains one element.**

The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x` and `y` to the input integers provided by the user. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `coord`, and `res`) remain unchanged, and `p1` and `p2` are still undefined because `coord` contains only one element.
