Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated to `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `coord`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
- `p1` and `p2` are calculated based on the differences in the x-coordinates of the tuples in `coord`.
- `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
