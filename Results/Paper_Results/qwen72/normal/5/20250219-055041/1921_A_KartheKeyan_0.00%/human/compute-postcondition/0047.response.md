Output State: **`i` is 1, `coord` is a list with at least 5 elements, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `n` is `n - 2` (where `n` must be greater than or equal to 2).** 

The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are now the input integers. The other variables (`i`, `coord`, `p1`, `p2`, `res`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
