Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are input integers.**

The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x` and `y` to the integers provided by the user input. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `coord`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `x` and `y` while keeping the initial state of the other variables intact.
