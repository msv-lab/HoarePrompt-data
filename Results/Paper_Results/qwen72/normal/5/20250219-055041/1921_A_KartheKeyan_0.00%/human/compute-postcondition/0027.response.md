The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit, which is a constant 4. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The state of `n` and the contents of `coord` do not affect the loop's execution condition, so they remain unchanged. `p1` and `p2` are not part of the loop head, so they also remain undefined.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `p1` and `p2` are undefined because `coord` now contains one element.**
