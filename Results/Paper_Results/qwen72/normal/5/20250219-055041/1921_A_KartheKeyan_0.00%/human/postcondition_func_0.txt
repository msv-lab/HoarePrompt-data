The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then calculates and prints the area of the square formed by these coordinates. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `n` being 0. The function does not return any value.
