Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 3.
- `n` remains `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1).
- `coord` remains a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`.
- `res` remains 0.
- `x` and `y` remain the input integers.
- `p1` is assigned the value `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
- `p2` is assigned the value `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`. This is the squared Euclidean distance between the x and y coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in the `coord` list.
