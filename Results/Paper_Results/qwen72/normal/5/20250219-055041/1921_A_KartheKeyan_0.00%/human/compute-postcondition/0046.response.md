The only variables in the loop head are `i`, so we can only adjust `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to the range specified in the loop head, which is `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `coord` is a list with at least 5 elements (the original 4 elements plus the new element `(x, y)`), `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `n` is `n - 2` (where `n` must be greater than or equal to 2).**
