To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to check the condition in the loop head: `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `sequence` is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - `size` is 1.
   - `number` is not equal to 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\).

3. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - For `size = 1`, the expression \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1\) becomes \((1 << 2) - 1\).
   - \((1 << 2) - 1\) is \(4 - 1 = 3\).

4. **Check the Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if \(3 \leq \text{number}\).

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `number` is already given to be in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\) and `number` is not equal to 0, the only way to ensure the loop executes is to ensure that `number` is at least 3.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `number` is at least 3.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), `size` is 1, and `number` is not equal to 0.**
