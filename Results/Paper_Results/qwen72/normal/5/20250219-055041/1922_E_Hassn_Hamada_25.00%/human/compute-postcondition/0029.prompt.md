You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, sequence is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], and the size of the generated sequence is returned as an integer. Additionally, number is not equal to 0.
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\), and `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\), `i` is `size - 1`, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `size - 1`, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`, but each element at index `size - result - 1 - i` for each `i` from 0 to `size - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1 - i] + result`, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
    return size + result
    #The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is the length of the `sequence` list, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. The `sequence` list has been modified such that each element at index `size - result - 1 - i` for each `i` from 0 to `size - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1 - i] + result`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the sum of the length of `sequence` and a value `result`, where `result` is obtained from a recursive call to `func_1` with a modified `number` and a modified `sequence` list. The `sequence` list is modified by incrementing each element at specific indices by `result`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is the length of the `sequence` list, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. The `sequence` list has been modified such that each element at index `size - result - 1 - i` for each `i` from 0 to `size - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1 - i] + result`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
