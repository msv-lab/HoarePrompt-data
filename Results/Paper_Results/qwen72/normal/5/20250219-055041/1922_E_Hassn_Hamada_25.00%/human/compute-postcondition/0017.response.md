Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\), `i` is 2, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing `[0, 1, 2]`**

The value of `i` (which is 2) is appended to the list `sequence`, which initially contains `[0, 1]`. Therefore, `sequence` now contains `[0, 1, 2]`. The values of `size`, `i`, and `number` remain unchanged.
