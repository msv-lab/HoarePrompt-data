Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\), `i` is `size - 1`, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `size` remains the same as it was initially, the variable `i` will be equal to `size - 1` (the last index of the loop), the `number` remains within the specified range, and the `sequence` list will contain all integers from 0 up to `size - 1`.
