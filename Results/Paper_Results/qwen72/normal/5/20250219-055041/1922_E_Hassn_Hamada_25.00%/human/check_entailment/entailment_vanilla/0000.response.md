### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are strictly increasing and maintain their relative order.
   - The array should have elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that meets the criteria.
   - The function works by recursively breaking down the number \( X \) into smaller parts and constructing the sequence accordingly.
   - The key idea is to use the properties of binary numbers and the combinatorial nature of subsequences to generate the sequence.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns 0, indicating that no elements are needed.
   - **Recursive Case**: The function finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number` and adds a sequence of integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
   - It then recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and appends the result to the `sequence`.
   - Finally, it adjusts the elements in the `sequence` to ensure that the subsequences are correctly counted.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - The function uses the binary representation of \( X \) to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The sequence is built by adding elements and then adjusting them to maintain the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which should not happen given the constraints), it prints -1.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the edge case where \( X \) is 2, which is the smallest possible value.
   - The program should also handle large values of \( X \) up to \( 10^{18} \).

7. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly generates the sequence by breaking down the number \( X \) and constructing the sequence based on the binary representation.
   - The sequence is adjusted to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - The program prints the correct output format for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem requirements. It generates an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, and the output format is correct.

Correctness: **True**
