Output State: **`size` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`, but the element at index `size - result - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1] + result`, and the element at index `-result - 2` is now `sequence[-result - 2] + result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `sequence[-result - i - 1]` is incremented by `result`.
- Since `i` is 1, the index `-result - i - 1` simplifies to `-result - 2`.
- The element at index `-result - 2` in `sequence` is increased by `result`.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
