### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array should have elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that meets the criteria.
   - The function works by recursively breaking down the number \( X \) into smaller parts and constructing the sequence accordingly.
   - The key idea is to use the properties of binary numbers and the combinatorial nature of subsequences to generate the sequence.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns 0, indicating that no elements are needed.
   - **Recursive Case**: The function finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number` and adds a sequence of integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
   - It then recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and appends the result to the `sequence`.
   - Finally, it adjusts the elements in the `sequence` to ensure that the subsequences are correctly counted.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - The function uses the binary representation of \( X \) to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The sequence is built by adding elements and then adjusting them to maintain the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which should not happen given the constraints), it prints -1.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the edge case where \( X \) is 2, which is the smallest possible value.
   - The program should also handle large values of \( X \) up to \( 10^{18} \).

7. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly generates the sequence by breaking down the number \( X \) and constructing the sequence based on the binary representation.
   - The sequence is adjusted to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - The program prints the correct output format for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. This is correct because an array with 0 elements has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence), but since we are looking for \( X \) increasing subsequences and \( X \) starts from 2, this case is not directly relevant.
- **Recursive Case**:
  - The function calculates `size` such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\). This is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `number + 1`.
  - It appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
  - It recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and appends the result to the `sequence`.
  - The function then adjusts the elements in the `sequence` to ensure that the subsequences are correctly counted. Specifically, it increments elements at specific indices to maintain the required number of increasing subsequences.

### Verification of Sequence Construction:
- The sequence is constructed by adding elements in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
- The adjustment of elements in the `sequence` ensures that the subsequences are correctly counted. For example, if `number` is 5, the sequence might be constructed as `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[], [0], [1], [0, 1], [0]`.

### Verification of Output:
- The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
- The output format is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Edge Cases:
- For \( X = 2 \), the sequence `[0]` is generated, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[], [0]`.
- For large values of \( X \), the function correctly handles the recursion and sequence construction, ensuring that the sequence length does not exceed 200 and that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem requirements. It generates an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, and the output format is correct.
