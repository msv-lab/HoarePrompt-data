To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

The loop condition is:
```
while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
```

This condition checks if \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1\) is less than or equal to `number`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `size` is increased by 2
- `number` is in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\)
- `number` is at least 3
- \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\)

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\) still holds true after the next iteration.

1. **Current State Analysis:**
   - `size` is increased by 2, so the new `size` is `size + 2`.
   - The condition for the next iteration will be \((1 << (size + 2 + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\), which simplifies to \((1 << (size + 3)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\).

2. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to ensure that \((1 << (size + 3)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\) holds true.
   - Given that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\) was true at the end of the previous iteration, we need to check if this new condition can be satisfied.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\) was true, and \((1 << (size + 3)) - 1\) is a larger value than \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1\), the loop can execute one more time if `number` is large enough to satisfy the new condition.
   - The only state that can be adjusted in the loop head is `size`.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute one more time. The current state already ensures that the loop condition will be met for the next iteration.

State: **`size` is increased by 2, `number` is in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\) and `number` is at least 3, and \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\)**
