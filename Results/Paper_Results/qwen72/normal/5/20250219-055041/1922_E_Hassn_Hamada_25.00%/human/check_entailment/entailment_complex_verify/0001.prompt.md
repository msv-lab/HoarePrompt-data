You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest integer `size` such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\), appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to `sequence`, and recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the modified `sequence`. The function returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call. Additionally, the `sequence` list is modified such that each element at index `size - result - 1 - i` for each `i` from 0 to `size - 1` is incremented by the result of the recursive call.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are strictly increasing and maintain their relative order.
   - The array should have elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that meets the criteria.
   - The function works by recursively breaking down the number \( X \) into smaller parts and constructing the sequence accordingly.
   - The key idea is to use the properties of binary numbers and the combinatorial nature of subsequences to generate the sequence.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns 0, indicating that no elements are needed.
   - **Recursive Case**: The function finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number` and adds a sequence of integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
   - It then recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and appends the result to the `sequence`.
   - Finally, it adjusts the elements in the `sequence` to ensure that the subsequences are correctly counted.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - The function uses the binary representation of \( X \) to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The sequence is built by adding elements and then adjusting them to maintain the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which should not happen given the constraints), it prints -1.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the edge case where \( X \) is 2, which is the smallest possible value.
   - The program should also handle large values of \( X \) up to \( 10^{18} \).

7. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly generates the sequence by breaking down the number \( X \) and constructing the sequence based on the binary representation.
   - The sequence is adjusted to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - The program prints the correct output format for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem requirements. It generates an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, and the output format is correct.

Correctness: **True**
