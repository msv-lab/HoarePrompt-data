The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `size`.

At the end of the last iteration, `size` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and the loop has just completed the first iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `size`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is 2 and `size` must be greater than 2.

State: **`size` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`, but the element at index `size - result - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1] + result`, and the element at index `-result - 2` is now `sequence[-result - 2] + result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**
