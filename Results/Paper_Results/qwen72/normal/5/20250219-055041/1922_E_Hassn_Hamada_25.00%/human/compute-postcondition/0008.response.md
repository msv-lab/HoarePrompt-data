Output State: **`size` is increased by 2, `number` is in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\) and `number` is at least 3, and \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\)**

Explanation:
- `size` is initially increased by 1 (as per the initial state).
- The code snippet `size += 1` further increments `size` by 1.
- Therefore, `size` is now increased by a total of 2 from its original value.
- The condition \((1 << (size + 2)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\) from the initial state is updated to \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\) because `size` has been incremented by 1.
- The other conditions for `number` remain unchanged.
