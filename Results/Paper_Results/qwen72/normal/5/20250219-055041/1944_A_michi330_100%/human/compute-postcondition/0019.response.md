The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). The function is expected to be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. It returns a result based on these parameters for each test case.**
