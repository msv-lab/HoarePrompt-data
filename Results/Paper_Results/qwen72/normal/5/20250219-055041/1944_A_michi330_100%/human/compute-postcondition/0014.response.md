The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `i` is 2, and `n` and `k` are input integers. The condition that `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` is not checked in the provided code snippet, so the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are updated based on the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer.**
