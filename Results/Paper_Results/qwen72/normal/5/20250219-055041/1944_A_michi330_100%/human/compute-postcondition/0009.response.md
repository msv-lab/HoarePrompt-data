Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided, and the conditions about `k` being greater than or equal to `n - 1` or less than `n - 1` do not change the variables. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged.
