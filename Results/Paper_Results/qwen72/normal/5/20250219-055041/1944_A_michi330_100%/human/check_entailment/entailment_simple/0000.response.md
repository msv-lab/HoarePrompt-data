Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most \( k \) bridges. The key insight is that if Dominater can destroy at least \( n - 1 \) bridges, Everule will be isolated on island 1 and won't be able to visit any other islands. This is because \( n - 1 \) bridges are the minimum number of bridges needed to connect island 1 to all other islands. If fewer than \( n - 1 \) bridges are destroyed, Everule will still be able to visit all \( n \) islands, as the remaining bridges will form a connected graph.

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \):
     - If \( k \geq n - 1 \), it prints `1` because Everule can only visit island 1.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n` because Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the logic described.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and the general case:
- When \( k \geq n - 1 \), Everule is isolated on island 1.
- When \( k < n - 1 \), Everule can still visit all islands.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
