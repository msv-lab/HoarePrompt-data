Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the program retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`. Otherwise, the program also retains the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`.***
