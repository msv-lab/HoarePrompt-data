Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \) but still significant enough to isolate some islands. Specifically, the program always prints \( n \) when \( k < n - 1 \), which is incorrect.

For example, consider the test case:
```
4 2
```
Here, \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \). The program will output:
```
4
```
However, if Dominater destroys the bridges between islands 1 and 2, and between islands 1 and 3, Everule will only be able to visit islands 1 and 4. Therefore, the correct output should be:
```
2
```

The program fails to account for the possibility of isolating some islands by destroying fewer than \( n - 1 \) bridges. It only checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \) and prints 1 in that case, otherwise it prints \( n \), which is not always correct.
