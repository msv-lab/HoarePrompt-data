Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `i` is `t`, `n` and `k` are input integers. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after the loop completes all iterations.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all `t` iterations, the value of `i` will be `t` because the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, starting from 0. The values of `n` and `k` are input integers that are read in each iteration, and they are not modified within the loop. Therefore, their values remain as the last input provided. The value of `t` itself is not changed by the loop, so it remains the same as the initial input.
