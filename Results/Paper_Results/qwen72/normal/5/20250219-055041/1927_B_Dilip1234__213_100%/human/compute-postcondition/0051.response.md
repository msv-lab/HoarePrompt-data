Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzb'.**

Explanation: The code appends the character corresponding to `j + ord('a')` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 2, `j + ord('a')` is `2 + 97 = 99`, which corresponds to the character 'b'. Therefore, the string `s` is updated to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzb'. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
