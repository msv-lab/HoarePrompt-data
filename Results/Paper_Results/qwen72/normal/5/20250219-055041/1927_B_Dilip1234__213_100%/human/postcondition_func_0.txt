The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is in the range 0 to `n-1`. It returns a string `s` that is constructed by appending characters from 'a' to 'z' based on the values in `a` and their corresponding counts in a list `char_count`. The character appended to `s` for each value `a_i` is the first character in the alphabet whose count in `char_count` matches `a_i`. After the function concludes, `s` will contain the characters appended in the order specified by the values in `a` and their counts. The `char_count` list will reflect the number of times each character from 'a' to 'z' was appended to `s`.
