The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit, which is a constant 26. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than 26.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than 26.

The other variables and the string `s` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
