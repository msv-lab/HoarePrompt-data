Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `s` is the string 'ab'. If `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, `s` is updated to 'abc', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables and string remain unchanged.***
