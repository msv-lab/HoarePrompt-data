The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The function returns a string `s` that contains characters appended during each iteration of the loop, based on the values in `a` and the counts in `char_count`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a string `s` that is constructed by appending characters based on the values in `a` and their corresponding counts in `char_count`.**
