Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is the string 'ab'**. 

The initial state specified that `s` is the string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` + 97, which is 'a'. After executing the code snippet `s += chr(j + ord('a'))`, the string `s` is updated to include an additional character 'b', making `s` the string 'ab'. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
