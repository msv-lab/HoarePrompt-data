Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza', `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 200000, `i` remains 2, `j` remains 1, and the string `s` remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza'. The value at the index `j` (which is 1) in the list `char_count` is incremented by 1.
