Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' followed by the characters that were added during the loop execution. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `char_count[j]`.***
