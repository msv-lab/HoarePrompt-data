The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range `26`. The loop iterates over the range `26`, which corresponds to the 26 letters of the English alphabet. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and the range `26` must still be valid (i.e., `j` must be less than 26).

Since the range `26` is a constant and does not change, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is the string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` + 97**
