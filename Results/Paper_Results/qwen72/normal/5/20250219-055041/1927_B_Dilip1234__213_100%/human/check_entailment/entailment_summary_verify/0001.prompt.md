You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
    return s



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is in the range 0 to `n-1`. It returns a string `s` that is constructed by appending characters from 'a' to 'z' based on the values in `a` and their corresponding counts in a list `char_count`. The character appended to `s` for each value `a_i` is the first character in the alphabet whose count in `char_count` matches `a_i`. After the function concludes, `s` will contain the characters appended in the order specified by the values in `a` and their counts. The `char_count` list will reflect the number of times each character from 'a' to 'z' was appended to `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **String Construction:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for constructing the string `s` based on the trace array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s` and a list `char_count` of length 26, all set to 0. This list will keep track of the number of occurrences of each character from 'a' to 'z'.

3. **Trace Array Processing:**
   - The program iterates over each element in the trace array `a`.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it searches for the first character (from 'a' to 'z') whose count in `char_count` matches `a[i]`.
   - Once it finds such a character, it appends it to the string `s` and increments the count of that character in `char_count`.

4. **Character Selection:**
   - The program ensures that the character selected for each position in the string `s` has the correct count as specified by the trace array `a`.
   - This is achieved by the inner loop that checks `char_count[j] == a[i]` and breaks once the correct character is found.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed string `s` for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `n = 11`, `a = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`
  - Output: `abracadabra`
  - Reason: The trace array correctly reflects the counts of characters in the string `abracadabra`.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `n = 10`, `a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`
  - Output: `codeforces`
  - Reason: The trace array correctly reflects the counts of characters in the string `codeforces`.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `n = 1`, `a = [0]`
  - Output: `a`
  - Reason: The trace array correctly reflects the counts of characters in the string `a`.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `n = 8`, `a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Output: `aaaaaaa`
  - Reason: The trace array correctly reflects the counts of characters in the string `aaaaaaa`.

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `n = 8`, `a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - Output: `dijkstra`
  - Reason: The trace array correctly reflects the counts of characters in the string `dijkstra`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a string `s` based on the given trace array `a` for each test case. The logic ensures that the counts of characters in the constructed string match the values in the trace array, and the program handles all valid inputs as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
