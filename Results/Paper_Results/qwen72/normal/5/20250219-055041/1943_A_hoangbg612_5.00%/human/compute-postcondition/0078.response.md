The only objects in the loop head are the variables `num` and the list `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `N`. If `N` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `N` must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `N`, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` will be the third element in the list `N`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `N`. If `num` > `cur`, then `cur` is equal to `num` and `M[cur]` is 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
