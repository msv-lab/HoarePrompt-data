Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is equal to `num`, `num` is the first element in `N`, and `num` is greater than `cur - 1`.** 

The value of `cur` is updated to be equal to `num`, which is the first element in the sorted list `N`. The condition `num > cur + 1` is no longer relevant since `cur` is now equal to `num`, and the other variables remain unchanged.
