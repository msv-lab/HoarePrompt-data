Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list, and the value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key. If the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, `cur` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
