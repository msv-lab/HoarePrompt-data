Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`, `cur` is equal to `i`, and the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `i`.
- The values of `T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `cur` must be greater than 0 is still valid, as `i` is greater than 0.
- The condition that the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i` remains valid.
