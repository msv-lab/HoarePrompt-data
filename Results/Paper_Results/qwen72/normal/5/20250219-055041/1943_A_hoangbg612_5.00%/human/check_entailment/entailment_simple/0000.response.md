### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `N` is sorted, which is a necessary step to facilitate the MEX calculation.

3. **Dictionary Initialization:**
   - A dictionary `M` is initialized to keep track of the counts of each number in the array `N`.

4. **Iterating Through the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M` and the variable `cur`.
   - `cur` is used to track the current MEX candidate. It starts at -1 and is incremented to the next integer that is not in the array `N`.

5. **Optimal Play:**
   - The program assumes that both players play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The logic in the loop ensures that `cur` is incremented only when the next integer is exactly one more than the current `cur`. This simulates Alice's optimal strategy of choosing the smallest available integer that is not yet in `c`.

6. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If it does, it increments `cur` by 1, which is incorrect because it doesn't account for the optimal play of Bob.
   - The final loop checks if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i` and updates `cur` accordingly. This is an attempt to ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated, but it is not necessary given the optimal play assumption.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Final MEX Calculation:**
  - The line `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:` is incorrect. This condition does not reflect the optimal play of Bob. Bob's strategy is to minimize the MEX, and this condition does not account for that.
  - The final loop `for i in range(cur):` is also unnecessary and incorrect. It does not correctly handle the optimal play of both players.

### Correct Approach:
- **Optimal Play:**
  - Alice will always choose the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
  - Bob will choose the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
  - The correct MEX can be determined by the length of the array `N` and the distribution of integers in `N`.

### Correctness:
- The program as written does not correctly handle the optimal play of Bob and has unnecessary and incorrect logic for calculating the final MEX.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
