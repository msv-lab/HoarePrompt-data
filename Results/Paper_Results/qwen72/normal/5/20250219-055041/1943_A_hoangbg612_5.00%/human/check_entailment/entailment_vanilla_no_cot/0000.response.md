Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating through the sorted list and updating a dictionary `M` to keep track of the counts of elements. However, the logic for updating the MEX (`cur`) is flawed.
   - The program increments `cur` and breaks the loop if an element is found that is greater than `cur + 1`. This does not accurately reflect the MEX calculation, especially when considering the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.

2. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob is not correctly implemented. Alice should always try to pick the smallest missing integer (MEX) to maximize the score, while Bob should try to prevent Alice from doing so by picking the smallest available integer.
   - The program does not account for the turns of Alice and Bob, and it does not simulate the game correctly.

3. **Dictionary Usage**:
   - The dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of elements, but the program does not correctly handle the case where elements are repeated and the MEX needs to be recalculated after each turn.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game with the optimal strategies for both players. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        
        mex = 0
        for num in N:
            if num == mex:
                mex += 1
        
        # If the number of elements is even, Bob can always prevent Alice from picking the next MEX
        if S % 2 == 0:
            print(mex)
        else:
            # If the number of elements is odd, Alice gets the last turn and can pick the next MEX
            print(mex + 1)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - We initialize `mex` to 0 and iterate through the sorted list `N`.
   - If the current element `num` is equal to `mex`, we increment `mex` by 1. This ensures that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array `c` after all elements are considered.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - If the number of elements `S` is even, Bob can always prevent Alice from picking the next MEX by picking the smallest available integer on his turn. Therefore, the final MEX is the value calculated after processing all elements.
   - If the number of elements `S` is odd, Alice gets the last turn and can pick the next MEX, so the final MEX is `mex + 1`.

This approach correctly simulates the game and ensures that both players play optimally.
