Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary as described, `cur` is the first index `i` in the range of the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any) where `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If no such index exists, `cur` is the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any).** 

The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `N` to a new sorted list of integers provided by the user, replacing the previous value of `N`. The other variables (`T`, `_`, `S`, `M`, `cur`) remain unchanged.
