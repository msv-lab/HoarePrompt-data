Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value, `cur` is equal to `num`.** 

The code `M[cur] = 1` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `M`, where the key is the value of `cur` (which is equal to `num`), and the value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
