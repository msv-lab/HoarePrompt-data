Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, and `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, `cur` is set to `i` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `cur` must be greater than 1.***
