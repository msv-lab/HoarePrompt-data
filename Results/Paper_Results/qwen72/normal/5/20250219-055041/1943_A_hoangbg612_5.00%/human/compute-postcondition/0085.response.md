Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `N`. If `num` > `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. If `num` > `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution. If `num` â‰¤ `cur`, then `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.***
