The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `N`. The loop iterates over each element in the `N` list, so the state of `num` is updated to the next element in `N` at the start of each iteration. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the second element in `N`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be updated to the third element in `N`, and `N` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the third element in `N`, `cur` is the second element in `N` if `num` > `cur` + 1, otherwise `cur` is incremented by 1**
