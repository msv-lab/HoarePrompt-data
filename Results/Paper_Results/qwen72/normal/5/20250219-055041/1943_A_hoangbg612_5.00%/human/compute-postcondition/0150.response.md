Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in the list, and the value for each key is the count of consecutive integers in `N` that are equal to the key, `i` is 1. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, `cur` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains greater than 1.***
