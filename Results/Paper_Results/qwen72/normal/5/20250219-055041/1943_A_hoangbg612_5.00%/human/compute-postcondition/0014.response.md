Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `cur` is the first element in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value, `num` is the first element in `N`, and the current value of `num` is greater than -1. If `num` > cur + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
