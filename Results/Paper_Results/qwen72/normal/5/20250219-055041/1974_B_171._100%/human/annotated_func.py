#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reversed `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `i` is `len_unique - 1`.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, where each character in the original string `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in the reversed `unique_chars` list according to the `char_map` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. In the returned string `decoded`, each character from the original string `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character in the reversed list of unique characters from `encoded`. The unique characters are determined by converting `encoded` to a set and then sorting it.
