Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly decodes the encoded string based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded strings `b`.

2. **Decoding Function**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in the sorted list to its symmetric character.
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program appends the decoded strings to a list `results` and prints them one by one.

This approach ensures that the decoding process is consistent with the encoding algorithm described in the problem. Each character in the encoded string is correctly mapped to its symmetric character in the sorted list of unique characters, and the decoded string is constructed accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.
