### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`.
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data` and increments the index.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`, and increments the index accordingly.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `char_map` to store the character mappings.
   - It iterates over the unique characters and maps each character to its symmetric character in the sorted list.
   - It constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the decoded string for each test case to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each decoded string in the `results` list.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the length of each encoded string.
  - It also correctly reads the encoded strings and processes them one by one.

- **Correctness of Decoding Logic:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them.
  - It correctly maps each character to its symmetric character in the sorted list.
  - The decoding process is performed by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles single-character strings correctly.
  - It also handles strings with repeated characters correctly, as the `char_map` only contains unique characters and their symmetric mappings.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct decoded strings.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
