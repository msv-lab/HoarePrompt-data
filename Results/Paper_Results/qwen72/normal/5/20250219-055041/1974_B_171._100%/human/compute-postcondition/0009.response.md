Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reversed `unique_chars`, `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `i` is `len_unique - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The string `encoded` remains unchanged and consists of lowercase Latin letters.
- The list `unique_chars` remains unchanged and is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.
- The dictionary `char_map` now contains mappings for all characters in `unique_chars`, where each character is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of the `unique_chars` list (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
- The variable `len_unique` still holds the length of the `unique_chars` list.
- The loop counter `i` has reached the value `len_unique - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
