The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. In the returned string `decoded`, each character from the original string `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character in the reversed list of unique characters from `encoded`. The unique characters are determined by converting `encoded` to a set and then sorting it.
