Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 3`, and `max_val` is updated to `x - 2` if `x` is divisible by `x - 2` and `2 * (x - 3)` is less than `x`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains 1. If `2 * (x - 3)` is greater than or equal to `x`, the program returns the integer value `y` which is `x - 3`.***
