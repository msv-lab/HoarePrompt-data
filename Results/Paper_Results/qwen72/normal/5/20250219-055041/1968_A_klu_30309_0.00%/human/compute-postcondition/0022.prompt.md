You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
        
    #State: `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is the largest integer `y` such that 2 <= y < x and `x % y == 0`, and `y` is 2. If no such `y` exists, `max_val` remains 1.
    return max_val
    #The program returns the largest integer `max_val` such that 2 <= `max_val` < `x` and `x % max_val == 0`. If no such `max_val` exists, the program returns 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `x` (2 <= x <= 1000) and returns `x - 1` if `x` is divisible by `x - 1` and `2 * (x - 1)` is greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is divisible by `x - 2` and `2 * (x - 2)` is less than `x`, it returns `x - 2`. If neither of these conditions is met, it returns `x - 3`. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns the largest integer `max_val` (2 <= `max_val` < `x`) that divides `x` without a remainder, or 1 if no such `max_val` exists.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the integer value `y` which is `x - 1`, where `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000, inclusive, and `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). Additionally, `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`.

Case_2: The program returns `y`, which is `x - 2`, where `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. If `x` is divisible by `y`, then `y` is updated to `x - 2` and `2 * y` is less than `x`. Otherwise, `y` remains `x - 2`.

Case_3: The program returns the integer value `y` which is `x - 3`, where `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.

Case_4: The program returns the largest integer `max_val` such that 2 <= `max_val` < `x` and `x % max_val == 0`. If no such `max_val` exists, the program returns 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
