### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - If there are multiple such \( y \), any one of them is acceptable.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` is designed to find the optimal \( y \) for a given \( x \).
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1, which is the smallest possible \( y \).

3. **Loop and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2. This is because \( y \) must be less than \( x \) and greater than 1.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) using the condition `if x % y == 0`.
     - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \), it further checks if \( 2 * y \ge x \).
       - If this condition is true, it immediately returns \( y \) because \( y \) is the largest possible value that satisfies \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) being maximized.
     - If the condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) is not true, it updates `max_val` to \( y \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and the function correctly returns 1.
   - For \( x = 7 \), the function returns 6, which is incorrect because \( 6 \) is not less than \( 7 \). The correct output should be 3, as \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), the function returns 18, which is incorrect because \( 18 \) is not less than \( 21 \). The correct output should be 7, as \( \gcd(21, 7) + 7 = 7 + 7 = 14 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), the function returns 98, which is incorrect because \( 98 \) is not less than \( 100 \). The correct output should be 50, as \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), the function returns 750, which is incorrect because \( 750 \) is not less than \( 1000 \). The correct output should be 500, as \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \).

5. **Logical Error**:
   - The condition `if 2 * y >= x` is incorrect. It should be `if 2 * y <= x` to ensure \( y \) is less than \( x \).
   - Additionally, the loop should start from \( x-1 \) and go down to 1, not 2, to cover all possible values of \( y \).

6. **Corrected Code**:
   - The loop should be `for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1)` to include \( y = 1 \).
   - The condition should be `if 2 * y <= x` to ensure \( y \) is less than \( x \).

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1(x)` has a logical error in the condition `if 2 * y >= x` and the loop should start from \( x-1 \) and go down to 1. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
