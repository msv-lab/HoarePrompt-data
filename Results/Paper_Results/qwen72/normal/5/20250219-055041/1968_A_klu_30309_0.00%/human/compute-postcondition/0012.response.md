Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 2`, `max_val` is `x - 2`. If `2 * y >= x`, the program returns `y`, which is `x - 2`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, then `max_val` is updated to `x - 2` and `2 * y` is less than `x`. Otherwise, `y` remains `x - 2` and `max_val` is `x - 2`.**
