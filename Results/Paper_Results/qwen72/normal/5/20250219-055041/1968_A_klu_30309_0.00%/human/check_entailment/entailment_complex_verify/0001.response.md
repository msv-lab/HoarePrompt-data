### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - If there are multiple such \( y \), any one of them is acceptable.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` is designed to find the optimal \( y \) for a given \( x \).
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1, which is the smallest possible \( y \).

3. **Loop and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2. This is because \( y \) must be less than \( x \) and greater than 1.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) using the condition `if x % y == 0`.
     - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \), it further checks if \( 2 * y \ge x \).
       - If this condition is true, it immediately returns \( y \) because \( y \) is the largest possible value that satisfies \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) being maximized.
     - If the condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) is not true, it updates `max_val` to \( y \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and the function correctly returns 1.
   - For \( x = 7 \), the function returns 6, which is incorrect because \( 6 \) is not less than \( 7 \). The correct output should be 3, as \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), the function returns 18, which is incorrect because \( 18 \) is not less than \( 21 \). The correct output should be 7, as \( \gcd(21, 7) + 7 = 7 + 7 = 14 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), the function returns 98, which is incorrect because \( 98 \) is not less than \( 100 \). The correct output should be 50, as \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), the function returns 750, which is incorrect because \( 750 \) is not less than \( 1000 \). The correct output should be 500, as \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \).

5. **Logical Error**:
   - The condition `if 2 * y >= x` is incorrect. It should be `if 2 * y <= x` to ensure \( y \) is less than \( x \).
   - Additionally, the loop should start from \( x-1 \) and go down to 1, not 2, to consider all possible values of \( y \).

6. **Corrected Function**:
   - The corrected function should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(x):
         max_val = 1
         for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
             if x % y == 0:
                 if 2 * y <= x:
                     return y
                 max_val = y
         return max_val
     ```

7. **Example Verification**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), the function returns 5, which is correct because \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), the function should return 3, as \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), the function should return 7, as \( \gcd(21, 7) + 7 = 7 + 7 = 14 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), the function should return 50, as \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), the function returns 1, which is correct because \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), the function should return 500, as \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), the function returns 3, which is correct because \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the logical error in the condition `if 2 * y >= x` and the loop range. The function as written does not correctly find the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) under the given constraints.

### Final: **False**
