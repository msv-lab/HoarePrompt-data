Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 3`, and `max_val` is `x - 3`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `max_val = y` assigns the value of `y` to `max_val`. Since `y` is `x - 3`, `max_val` is now `x - 3`. The other conditions and values in the initial state remain unchanged.
