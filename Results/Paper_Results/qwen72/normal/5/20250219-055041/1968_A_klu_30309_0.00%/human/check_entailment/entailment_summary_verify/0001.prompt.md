You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
    return max_val



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (where 2 <= x <= 1000) and returns the largest integer `y` such that 2 <= y < x and `x % y == 0`. If no such `y` exists, the function returns 1. The function aims to find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` under the given constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - If there are multiple such \( y \), any one of them is acceptable.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` is designed to find the optimal \( y \) for a given \( x \).
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1, which is the smallest possible \( y \).

3. **Loop and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2. This is because \( y \) must be less than \( x \) and greater than 1.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) using the condition `if x % y == 0`.
     - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \), it further checks if \( 2 * y \ge x \).
       - If this condition is true, it immediately returns \( y \) because \( y \) is the largest possible value that satisfies \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) being maximized.
     - If the condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) is not true, it updates `max_val` to \( y \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no \( y \) is found that divides \( x \) and satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \), the function returns `max_val`, which is the largest \( y \) that divides \( x \) (but not necessarily satisfying \( 2 * y \ge x \)).
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and the function correctly returns 1.

5. **Optimality**:
   - The function ensures that it finds the largest \( y \) that divides \( x \) and satisfies the condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) if such a \( y \) exists.
   - If no such \( y \) exists, it returns the largest \( y \) that divides \( x \), which is still a valid solution because it maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) among the divisors of \( x \).

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), the function returns 5, which is correct because \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), the function returns 6, which is incorrect because \( 6 \) is not less than \( 7 \). The correct output should be 3, as \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), the function returns 18, which is incorrect because \( 18 \) is not less than \( 21 \). The correct output should be 7, as \( \gcd(21, 7) + 7 = 7 + 7 = 14 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), the function returns 98, which is incorrect because \( 98 \) is not less than \( 100 \). The correct output should be 50, as \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), the function returns 1, which is correct because \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), the function returns 750, which is incorrect because \( 750 \) is not less than \( 1000 \). The correct output should be 500, as \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), the function returns 3, which is correct because \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \).

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1(x)` has a logical error in the condition `if 2 * y >= x`. It should be `if 2 * y <= x` to ensure \( y \) is less than \( x \). Additionally, the loop should start from \( x-1 \) and go down to 1, not 2.
