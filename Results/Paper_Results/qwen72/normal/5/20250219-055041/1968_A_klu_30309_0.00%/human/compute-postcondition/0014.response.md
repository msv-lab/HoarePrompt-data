The only variables in the loop head are `y` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `x - 1` down to 2, decrementing `y` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `x - 2` and `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` becomes `x - 3`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than 1.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is `x - 3`, `max_val` is updated to `x - 2` if `x` is divisible by `x - 2` and `2 * (x - 2)` is less than `x`, otherwise `max_val` remains 1**
