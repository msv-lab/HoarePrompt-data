Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000 - k, `min` is -100000000 + k, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` if `x` was originally even, or starting with `min` if `x` was originally odd, but now reversed to start with `max` and alternate with `min`, `t` is `k`**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. The other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `ans` still starts with `max` and alternates with `min`, but the starting value is now determined by the new value of `x`.
