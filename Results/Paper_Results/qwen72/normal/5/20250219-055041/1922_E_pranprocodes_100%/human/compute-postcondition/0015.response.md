Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `t` is 0. If `x` is even, `max` is updated to 99999999, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, and `x` is updated to `x` divided by 2. If `x` is odd, `min` is updated to -99999999, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, and `x` remains unchanged.**
