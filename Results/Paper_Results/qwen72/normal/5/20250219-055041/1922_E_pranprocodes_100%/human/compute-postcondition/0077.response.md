To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered).
   - `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered).
   - `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x`, but in reverse order.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - Since `x` starts at 1, it is an odd number.
   - The number of even `x` values encountered is 0.
   - The number of odd `x` values encountered is 1.
   - Therefore, `max` is 100000000 - 0 = 100000000.
   - `min` is -100000000 + 1 = -99999999.

3. **Building the `ans` List:**
   - Since `x` is 1 (an odd number), the value appended to `ans` will be `min`.
   - `ans` will contain a single value: `min`.
   - `ans` in reverse order will still be a list containing a single value: `min`.

4. **Total Number of Iterations (`t`):**
   - Since `x` is already 1, it took 0 iterations to become 1.
   - However, the initial state indicates that `x` is 1 and `i` is 1, so we can assume that the iteration count `t` is 1 (the initial state itself).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.
   - The `ans` list contains a single value: `-99999999`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **-99999999**
