Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered), `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for even `x` and `min` values appended for odd `x`, but the order of elements in `ans` is reversed, and `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.**
