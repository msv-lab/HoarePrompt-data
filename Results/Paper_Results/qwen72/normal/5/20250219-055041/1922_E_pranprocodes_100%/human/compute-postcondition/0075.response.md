The `ans.reverse()` function reverses the list `ans` in place. This means the order of the elements in `ans` is reversed, but the values themselves remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered), `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x`, but in reverse order, and `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.**
