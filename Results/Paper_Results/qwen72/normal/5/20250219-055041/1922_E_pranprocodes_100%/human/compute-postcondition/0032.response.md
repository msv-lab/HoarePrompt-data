The value of `x` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `x` was an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, updated to `x // 2` if `x` was even or remains unchanged if `x` was odd, and then decreased by 1 if `x` was odd. The other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, updated to `x // 2 - 1` if `x` was even or `x - 1` if `x` was odd; `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, or 99999998 if `x` was odd; `min` is -99999998 if `x` was even, or -99999997 if `x` was odd; `ans` is a list containing 100000000 if `x` was even or -100000000 if `x` was odd, and now also contains `max` if `x` was even, or [-100000000, -100000000] if `x` was odd, and now also contains `min`; `t` is 2.**
