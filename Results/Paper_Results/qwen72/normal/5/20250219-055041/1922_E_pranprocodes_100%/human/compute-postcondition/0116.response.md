Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered).
- `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered).
- `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for even `x` and `min` values appended for odd `x`, but the order of elements in `ans` is reversed.
- `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is 1.
   - Since `x` is 1 (an odd number), `min` will be updated to -100000000 + 1 = -99999999.
   - `max` remains 100000000 because no even `x` values have been encountered yet.
   - `ans` will start as an empty list.

2. **Iteration Process:**
   - The loop will run until `x` becomes 1. Since `x` is already 1, the loop will not execute any further iterations.
   - Therefore, `t` will be 0 (no iterations).

3. **Appending to `ans`:**
   - Since `x` is 1 (odd) and the loop does not run, `ans` will have only one element, which is `min`.
   - `ans` will be `[min]`.

4. **Reversing `ans`:**
   - The list `ans` is reversed, but since it only contains one element, the reversed list is still `[min]`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `ans` is `[min]`, which is `[-99999999]`.

### Print Statement:
- The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

### Output:
Output: **-99999999**
