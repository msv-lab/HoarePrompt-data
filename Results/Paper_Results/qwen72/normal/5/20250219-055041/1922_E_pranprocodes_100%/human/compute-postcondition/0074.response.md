Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered), `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x`, and `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.**

Natural language explanation:
- The loop continues until `x` becomes 1.
- For each even `x`, `max` is decremented by 1 and appended to `ans`.
- For each odd `x`, `min` is incremented by 1 and appended to `ans`.
- The final value of `max` will be 100000000 minus the number of times `x` was even.
- The final value of `min` will be -100000000 plus the number of times `x` was odd.
- The list `ans` will contain a sequence of values, where each value is either the current `max` (for even `x`) or the current `min` (for odd `x`), in the order they were appended.
- `t` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is the number of times `x` was not 1 before it became 1.
