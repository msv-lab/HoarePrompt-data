The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `min` depends on whether `x` is even or odd. If `x` is even, `min` was `-100000000`, and if `x` is odd, `min` was `-99999998`. After the increment, `min` will be `-99999999` if `x` is even, and `-99999997` if `x` is odd. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `t` is 2, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is a list containing `[100000000, 99999999, -100000000]` if `x` is even; `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999997, and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999, -99999998]` if `x` is odd.**
