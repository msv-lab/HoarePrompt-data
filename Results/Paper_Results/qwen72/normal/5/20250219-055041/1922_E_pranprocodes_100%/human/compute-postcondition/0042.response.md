Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` and alternating with `min`, `t` is `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `min` is updated to -100000000, which is a specific value. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `ans`, `t`) remain unchanged. The list `ans` still contains alternating values of `max` (100000000) and `min` (-100000000) starting with `max`. The value of `t` is still `k`.
