The function `func` accepts no parameters. It is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array, if it exists, should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

Functionality: **The function returns an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, where X is a positive integer (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). If no such array exists, it returns -1. The elements of the array, if it exists, are within the range [-10^9, 10^9].**
