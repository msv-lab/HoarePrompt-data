Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the first elements of all tuples in `d`, in the order they appear in `d`; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the parentheses sequence in ascending order, and for positions with the same depth, they are sorted by their indices in descending order.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` (the length of `s`) also remains unchanged because `s` is not modified.
- The variable `ans` is built by concatenating the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the first elements of each tuple in `d`. After all iterations, `ans` will contain all these characters in the order they appear in `d`.
- The list `d` remains unchanged because it is only iterated over and not modified within the loop.
