### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program reads the input string `n` and immediately calls `func_1(n)`, which is responsible for performing the balanced shuffle operation.
   - The result of `func_1(n)` is then printed.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty string `ans` and a dictionary `d` to store the prefix balances.
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the prefix balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - This part correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position in the string.

3. **Removing the Last Balance:**
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the last balance is not needed for the sorting step.
   - However, this step is incorrect. The last balance should not be removed because it is part of the prefix balances that need to be considered for the sorting. The correct approach would be to remove the initial `d[0]` entry, which represents the balance before the first character, as it is not part of the sequence.

4. **Sorting the Prefix Balances:**
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the prefix balance in increasing order, and for ties, in decreasing order of position.
   - This is achieved using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))`.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem description.

5. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of tuples and constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` based on the sorted positions.
   - This step correctly reorders the characters according to the balanced shuffle operation.

6. **Returning the Result:**
   - The function returns the constructed string `ans`.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem description.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the prefix balances and sorts them as required.
- The construction of the result string `ans` is done by appending characters from the original string `s` based on the sorted positions.
- However, the removal of the last balance entry using `d.pop(n)` is incorrect. The initial balance `d[0]` should be removed instead.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct but contains a minor error in the removal of the last balance entry. This error affects the correctness of the program. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, the initial balance `d[0]` should be removed instead of the last balance entry. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(0)  # Remove the initial balance
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i - 1]  # Adjust the index to match the original string
    return ans
```

With this fix, the program should correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.
