The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", which is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It returns a string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` rearranged based on their depth in the parentheses sequence. Specifically, the characters are ordered by their depth in ascending order, and for characters at the same depth, they are ordered by their original indices in descending order. The original string `s` remains unchanged.
