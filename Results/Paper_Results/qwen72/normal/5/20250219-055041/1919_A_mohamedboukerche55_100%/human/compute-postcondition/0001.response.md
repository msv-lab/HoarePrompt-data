The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the function should take two parameters `a` and `b` which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and the number of test cases `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, and `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `t` must be an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0**
