The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input, splits it into two integers `a` and `b`, and checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
