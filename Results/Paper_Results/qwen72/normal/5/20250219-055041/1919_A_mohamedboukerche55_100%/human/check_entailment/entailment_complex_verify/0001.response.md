### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to either swap wallets with the other or keep their current wallet.
   - After making the choice, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses the game.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If both players play optimally, the key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will always win.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will always win.
   - This is because the game will always end with both wallets being empty at the same time if the total number of coins is even, and with one wallet having one coin left while the other is empty if the total number of coins is odd. Since Alice goes first, she will always be the one to make the last move if the total is odd, and Bob will make the last move if the total is even.

3. **Parity Explanation:**
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will always end with both wallets being empty at the same time. Since Bob goes second, he will always be the one to make the last move, thus winning the game.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the game will end with one wallet having one coin left while the other is empty. Since Alice goes first, she will always be the one to make the last move, thus winning the game.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the modulo operation `(a + b) % 2`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - The input and output handling is correct for the given problem description.
   - The program will produce the correct result for each test case as per the optimal play strategy.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and will determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play strategy for each test case. The original assessment was accurate.
