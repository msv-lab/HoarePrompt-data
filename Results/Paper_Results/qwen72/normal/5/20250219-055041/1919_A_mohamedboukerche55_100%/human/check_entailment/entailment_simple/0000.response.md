### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, `a` and `b`, which represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The function uses the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` to determine the winner.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, the function prints 'Bob'.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, the function prints 'Alice'.

3. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The game involves each player making two decisions per turn: whether to swap wallets and whether to remove a coin.
   - The key observation is that the game will always end when the total number of coins in both wallets is reduced to zero. The player who is forced to make a move when the total number of coins is zero loses.
   - If the total number of coins is even, both players can always mirror each other's moves (i.e., if one player swaps, the other can swap back, and if one player removes a coin, the other can remove a coin from the other wallet). This ensures that the player who starts second (Bob) will always be the one to make the last move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the player who starts first (Alice) will always be the one to make the last move, as the parity of the total number of coins will change with each move.

4. **Function Definition:**
   - The function definition `def func():` is correct for the given problem, as it does not need to take any parameters explicitly. The input is handled within the function.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1 correctly. In this case, the sum is 2 (even), so Bob wins.
   - The function also handles cases where `a` and `b` are large numbers (up to \(10^9\)) correctly, as the modulo operation is efficient and works for large numbers.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem description and handles the input and output as required. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
