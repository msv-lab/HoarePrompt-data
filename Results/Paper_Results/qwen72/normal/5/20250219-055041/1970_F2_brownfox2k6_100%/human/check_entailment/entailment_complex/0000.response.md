### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly initializes the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`), the positions of the goals (`rg` and `bg`), the Quaffle (`ball`), the Bludger (`blud`), and the players (`player`).
   - The `carry` variable is used to track which player is carrying the Quaffle.

2. **Game Loop:**
   - The game loop iterates for `T` steps, where `T` is the number of actions.
   - For each action, the program correctly parses the entity performing the action (`p`) and the action itself (`d`).

3. **Handling Actions:**
   - **Catching the Quaffle:**
     - If the action is `C`, the program correctly updates the `carry` variable to indicate that the player is now carrying the Quaffle.
   - **Throwing the Quaffle:**
     - If the action is `T`, the program correctly updates the `carry` variable to `None` to indicate that the player is no longer carrying the Quaffle.
     - It then checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If the Quaffle is in a red goal (`RG`), the blue team scores a point, and vice versa.
     - The Quaffle is then reset to the middle of the field.
   - **Moving Entities:**
     - If the action is a movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), the program correctly updates the position of the entity (Quaffle, Bludger, or player) using the `func_1` function.
     - After moving a player, the program calls `func_2` to check for any players that have been eliminated by the Bludger.

4. **Checking for Eliminations:**
   - The `func_2` function correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the Bludger.
   - It prints the elimination event and updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]` to indicate that the player is out of the game.

5. **Final Score:**
   - After all actions are processed, the program correctly prints the final score.

### Potential Issues:
- **Bludger Elimination:**
  - The program correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger, but it does not explicitly check if the player is carrying the Quaffle when they are eliminated. However, the problem statement guarantees that a player carrying the Quaffle will not be in a cell with a goal when eliminated, so this is not an issue.
- **Quaffle Reset:**
  - The Quaffle is correctly reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, which is consistent with the problem description.
- **Output Order:**
  - The program ensures that events are printed in ascending order of `t`, and if multiple players are eliminated at the same time, the events are printed in alphabetical order.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the specified actions, checks for eliminations, and updates the score and positions as required. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
