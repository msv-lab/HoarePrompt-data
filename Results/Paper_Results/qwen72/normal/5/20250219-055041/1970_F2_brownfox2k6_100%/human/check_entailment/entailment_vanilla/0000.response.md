### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two teams (Red and Blue) with players, goals, a Quaffle, and a Bludger.
   - Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw the Quaffle.
   - The Bludger can eliminate players if they are in the same cell.
   - Scoring occurs when a player leaves the Quaffle in the opponent's goal.
   - The Quaffle resets to the middle of the field after a score.
   - The program should output events (scoring, elimination) and the final score.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The input includes the dimensions of the field (N, M), the initial field state, and a series of actions.
   - The field state is represented by a grid where each cell contains a pair of characters indicating the entity (empty, player, goal, Quaffle, Bludger).

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(obj, d)**: This function updates the position of an entity (player, Quaffle, Bludger) based on the direction (U, D, L, R).
     - It correctly updates the position by modifying the coordinates.
   - **func_2(t)**: This function checks for and handles player eliminations.
     - It iterates through the player dictionary to find players at the same position as the Bludger.
     - It prints the elimination event and updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]` to indicate elimination.
     - It ensures that the eliminations are printed in alphabetical order.

4. **Event Handling**:
   - The program needs to handle the following events:
     - Player movement.
     - Player catching the Quaffle.
     - Player throwing the Quaffle.
     - Player elimination by the Bludger.
     - Scoring and updating the score.
     - Resetting the Quaffle position after a score.
   - The provided functions handle movement and elimination, but the program is incomplete and does not handle catching, throwing, or scoring.

5. **Output Requirements**:
   - The program should print events in the format specified (e.g., `t RED GOAL`, `t B0 ELIMINATED`).
   - The final score should be printed in the format `FINAL SCORE: r b`.

6. **Missing Components**:
   - The program does not have a function to handle catching the Quaffle.
   - The program does not have a function to handle throwing the Quaffle.
   - The program does not have a function to handle scoring and updating the score.
   - The program does not have a function to reset the Quaffle position after a score.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incomplete and lacks the necessary functions to handle all the required events (catching, throwing, scoring, and resetting the Quaffle). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
