Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are input integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The variable `_` is `t - 1`, and for each iteration, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output for that test case is `a * n`. Otherwise, the output for that test case is `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k + (n - k) * a`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `t` times. For each of these `t` test cases, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` were taken as inputs, and the variable `k` was calculated as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. Depending on whether `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output for each test case is either `a * n` or `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k + (n - k) * a`. The initial state of `t` and the constraints on `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
