Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The other variables (`_`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, `b - a` will be 0 or negative, and `k` will be 0. If `b` is greater than `a`, `k` will be the smaller value between `n` and `b - a`.
