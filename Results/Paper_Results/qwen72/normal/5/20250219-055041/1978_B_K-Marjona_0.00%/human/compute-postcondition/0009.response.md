Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**

The code snippet `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` based on the new input provided. The initial state variables `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are still valid, but `n`, `a`, and `b` now hold the new values provided by the input. The condition for `k` remains unchanged and will depend on the new values of `a` and `b` after the input.
