Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the new input integers.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are reassigned based on the new inputs provided by `input().split()`.
- The variable `_` remains unchanged at 2.
- The value of `k` is still the minimum of the updated `n` and the difference between the updated `b` and `a`.
