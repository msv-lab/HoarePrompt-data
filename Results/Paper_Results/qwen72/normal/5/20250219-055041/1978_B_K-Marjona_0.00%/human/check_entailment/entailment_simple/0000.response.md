Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Choosing `k`**: The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This is a reasonable approach because:
   - `k` should not exceed `n` (the number of buns).
   - `k` should not exceed `b - a` because if `k` is greater than `b - a`, the modified prices will not be beneficial (i.e., the price of the buns will drop below the usual price `a`).

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, the program prints `a * n`. This is correct because if the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` to maximize profit.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the profit as `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k + (n - k) * a`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns:
     - The sum of the first `k` buns sold at modified prices is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`, which is `((b + (b - k + 1)) * k) // 2`.
     - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Arithmetic Series Sum**: The formula `((b + (b - k + 1)) * k) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `b <= a`, the program correctly outputs `a * n` for all buns.
   - When `b > a`, the program correctly calculates the profit by selling the first `k` buns at modified prices and the rest at the usual price.

6. **Output**: The program prints the correct profit for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all the cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
