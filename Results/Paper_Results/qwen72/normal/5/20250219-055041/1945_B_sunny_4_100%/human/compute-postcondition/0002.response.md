The only variables in the loop head are `qi` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the input integer, and for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `qi` should be initialized to 0, as this is the starting point for the range function.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `qi` is 0**
