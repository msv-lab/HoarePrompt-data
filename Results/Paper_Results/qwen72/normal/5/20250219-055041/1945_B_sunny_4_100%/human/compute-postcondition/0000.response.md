Output State: **`t` is the input integer, for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are the input integers, `A` is `int(m/a) + 1`, `B` is `int(m/b) + 1`, and `A + B` is printed.**

Explanation:
- `t` is assigned the value of the input integer, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
- For each test case (from 1 to `t`), `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values of the input integers, each of which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^18.
- `A` is calculated as `int(m/a) + 1`, which is the integer division of `m` by `a` plus 1.
- `B` is calculated as `int(m/b) + 1`, which is the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 1.
- The sum `A + B` is printed for each test case.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain as the input values, and `A` and `B` are updated for each test case.
