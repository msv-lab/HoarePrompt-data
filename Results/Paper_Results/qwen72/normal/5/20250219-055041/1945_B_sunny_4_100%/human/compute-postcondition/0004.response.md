Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `qi` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers, `ans` is equal to `m // a + m // b + 2`.** 

The value of `ans` is calculated as the integer division of `m` by `a` plus the integer division of `m` by `b`, and then 2 is added to the result. The values of `t`, `qi`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.
