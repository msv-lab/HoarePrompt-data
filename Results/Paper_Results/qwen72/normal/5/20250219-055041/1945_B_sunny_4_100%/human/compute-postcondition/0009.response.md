Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `qi` is 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers.
   - `ans` is equal to `m // a + m // b + 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `m // a` performs integer division of `m` by `a`, which gives the quotient without the remainder.
   - `m // b` performs integer division of `m` by `b`, which gives the quotient without the remainder.
   - `ans` is the sum of these two quotients plus 2.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

4. **Output:**
   - The value of `ans` will be the sum of the integer division of `m` by `a` and `m` by `b`, plus 2.

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where `m`, `a`, and `b` are input integers)**
