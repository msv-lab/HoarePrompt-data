Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. It then calculates the value `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program includes `t` being equal to the initial number of test cases, `qi` being `t-1`, and `a`, `b`, and `m` being the last set of input integers for the final test case. **
