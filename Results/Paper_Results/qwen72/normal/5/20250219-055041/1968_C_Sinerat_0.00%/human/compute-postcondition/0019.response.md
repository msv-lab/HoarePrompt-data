The code snippet `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[1]` by adding `x[0]` to `a[0]`. Given the initial state, `a[0]` is 500, `i` is 1, and `x[0]` is an integer. Therefore, `a[1]` is updated to `500 + x[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with `a[0]` set to 500 and `a[1]` set to `500 + x[0]`, `x` is a list of integers.**
