Output State: **`n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the second element is 500 + `x[0]`, and the rest are 0, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

The value of `a[1]` is updated to be the sum of `a[0]` (which is 500) and `x[0]` (the first element of the `x` list). The values of `n`, `i`, and the rest of the elements in `a` and `x` remain unchanged.
