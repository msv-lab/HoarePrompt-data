Output State: **`n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500, `x` is a list of integers.**

The value of `n` has been updated to a new input integer greater than 0. The value of `i` is now `n-1`. The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the first `i-1` elements of `x` added to 500. The list `x` remains unchanged.
