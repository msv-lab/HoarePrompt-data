Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `x` is a list of integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = [0] * n` initializes the list `a` with `n` zeros.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The previous assignments to `a[1]`, `a[2]`, ..., `a[n-1]` are no longer valid because `a` has been reinitialized to a list of zeros.
