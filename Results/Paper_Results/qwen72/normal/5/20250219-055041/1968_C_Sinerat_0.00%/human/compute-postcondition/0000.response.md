The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0. The other details about the function `func` and the constraints on `t`, `n`, and `x` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted here.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
