The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`**
