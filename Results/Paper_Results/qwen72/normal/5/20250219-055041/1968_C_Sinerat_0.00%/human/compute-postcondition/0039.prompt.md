Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle input through a predefined structure or external method not shown in the function definition. Typically, it would involve reading multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` where `2 <= n <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and the sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 500
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is set to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500, `x` is a list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x` (i.e., `a[i] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`), and `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
