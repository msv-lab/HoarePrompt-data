The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, because the range starts at 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`. The variable `i` will be set to 1 at the start of the loop, as it is the first value in the range.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with `a[0]` set to 500, `x` is a list of integers.**
