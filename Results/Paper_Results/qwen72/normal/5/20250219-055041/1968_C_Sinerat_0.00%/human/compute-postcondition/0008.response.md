Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` is executed.
- `i` is 2, so `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`.
- The initial state indicates that `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`, so this value is used in the calculation.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2, and `i` remains 2.
- The other variables and conditions in the initial state are not affected.
