Postcondition: ***`pos` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 elements, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the third element in `arr`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - 3)`, then `ans` is 3 and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 3)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
