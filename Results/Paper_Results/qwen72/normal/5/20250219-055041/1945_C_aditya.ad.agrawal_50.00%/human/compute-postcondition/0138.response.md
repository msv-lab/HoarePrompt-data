Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`. If `i` == 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b_d` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`.
- The initial state variables `arr`, `i`, `pos`, `ans`, `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, and `o_r` remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `b_d`.
- The value of `pos` is still increased by 1, and `ans` is still equal to `pos`.
- The conditions for `i` being 0 or not 0 still apply, affecting `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, and `o_r` accordingly.
- `b_d` is now equal to the absolute value of the difference between `n / 2` and the updated `pos`.
