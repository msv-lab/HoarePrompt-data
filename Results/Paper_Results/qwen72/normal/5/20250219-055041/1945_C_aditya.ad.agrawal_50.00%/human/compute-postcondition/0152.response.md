Output State: **`pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_l` is the count of zeros in the first half of `arr`, `o_l` is the count of ones in the first half of `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met, `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the conditions were last met, `t` is decreased by 1.**
