Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 2 elements. `i` is the second element in `arr`. `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. `ans` is equal to `pos`. `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.**

Explanation:
- `arr` remains a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` remains the second element in `arr`.
- `pos` is increased by 1.
- If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1.
- If `i` is 1, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.
- `ans` is set to the new value of `pos`.
- `b_d` is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between `n / 2` and the new value of `pos`.
