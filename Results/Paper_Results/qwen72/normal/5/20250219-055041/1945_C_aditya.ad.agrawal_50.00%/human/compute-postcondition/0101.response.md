To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pos` is `n`.
   - `z_l` is the count of zeros in `arr`.
   - `o_l` is the count of ones in `arr`.
   - `z_r` is 0.
   - `o_r` is 0.
   - `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` was last satisfied.
   - `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the condition was satisfied.

2. **Understanding the Conditions:**
   - The condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` means that the number of ones on the right side of the current position (`pos`) should be at least half of the total number of elements (zeros and ones) on the right side.
   - The condition `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` means that the number of zeros on the left side of the current position (`pos`) should be at least half of the total number of elements (zeros and ones) on the left side.
   - `ans` is the position where both of these conditions were last satisfied.
   - `b_d` is the minimum value of the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos` where the conditions were satisfied.

3. **Determining the Value of `ans`:**
   - The value of `ans` is determined by iterating through the array `arr` and checking the conditions at each position.
   - The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values in `arr` and the position `n`.

Since the exact values of `arr` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(ans)` statement will output the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` were last satisfied.

Output: **ans (where ans is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` were last satisfied)**
