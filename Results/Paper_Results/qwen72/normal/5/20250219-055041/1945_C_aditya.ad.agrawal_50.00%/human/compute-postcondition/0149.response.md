Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `b_d`, and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` == 0, `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_r` is decreased by 1 and `o_l` is increased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is now equal to `pos`, and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.***
