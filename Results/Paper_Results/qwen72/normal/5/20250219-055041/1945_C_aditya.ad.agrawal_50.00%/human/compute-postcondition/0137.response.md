Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`. If `i` == 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.**

The code assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`. The other conditions and variable states remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is equal to `pos`, and the values of `arr`, `i`, `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, and `o_r` are still determined based on the initial state.
