Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_l` is increased by 1.**

The value of `o_l` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `pos`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
