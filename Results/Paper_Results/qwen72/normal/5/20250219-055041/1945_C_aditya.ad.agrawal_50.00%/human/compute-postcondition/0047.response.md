Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` == 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is assigned to be equal to `pos`.
- The initial state conditions for `arr`, `i`, and the changes to `pos`, `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, and `o_r` remain unchanged.
- The only new information is that `ans` now holds the value of `pos`.
