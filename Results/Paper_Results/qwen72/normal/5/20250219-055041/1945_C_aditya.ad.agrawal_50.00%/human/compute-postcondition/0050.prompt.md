Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *The function `func` processes multiple test cases with each test case including an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3Â·10^5. `t` is greater than 0. `n` is an input integer. `input_string` is an input string. `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1). `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`. `o` is the count of ones in `arr`. `z_r` is equal to `z`. `o_r` is equal to `o`. `z_l` is 0. `o_l` is 0. `dist` is equal to `abs(n / 2)`. `ans` is 0. `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, `b_d` is set to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 1 element. `i` is the first element in `arr`. `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. If `i` is 1, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and the current value of `pos` is greater than the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans` and `b_d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 2 elements. `i` is the second element in `arr`. `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is set to `pos` and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` == 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
