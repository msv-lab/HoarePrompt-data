Output State: **`pos` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of the corresponding character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 elements, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o` is the count of ones in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1 or 3, `z_r` is `z - 2` or `z`, `o_r` is `o` or `o - 2`, `ans` is 0 or 2, `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - 3)` or `abs(n / 2 - 3)` if `ans` is 2.**

Explanation:
- `o_l` is incremented by 1.
- If `i` is 0, `o_l` was 0, so now `o_l` is 1.
- If `i` is not 0, `o_l` was 2, so now `o_l` is 3.
- The values of `pos`, `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `dist`, `i`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `ans`, and `b_d` remain unchanged unless they were affected by the conditions in the initial state.
