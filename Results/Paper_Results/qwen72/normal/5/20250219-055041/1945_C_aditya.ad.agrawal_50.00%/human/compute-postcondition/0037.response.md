Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 2 elements. `i` is the second element in `arr`. `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. `ans` is equal to `pos`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer (0 or 1) and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is the second element in `arr`.
- `pos` is increased by 1.
- If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1.
- Otherwise, if `i` is 1, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.
- The code snippet `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the updated value of `ans` which is equal to `pos`.
