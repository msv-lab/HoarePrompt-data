Output State: **`pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the count of zeros in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` was last satisfied, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the condition was satisfied, `t` is non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting each character in `input_string` to an integer, `z` is the count of zeros in `arr`.**

The variable `z` is now assigned the count of zeros in the list `arr`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
