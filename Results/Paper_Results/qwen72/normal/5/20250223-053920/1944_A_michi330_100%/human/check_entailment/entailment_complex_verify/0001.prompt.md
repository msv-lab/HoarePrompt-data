You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    4 4

Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. For each iteration, if `k` was greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the output was `1`. Otherwise, the output was `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged after the loop, but the loop has processed `t` test cases and printed the corresponding output for each.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function has printed the appropriate output for each case, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.
   - Dominater can destroy at most `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can visit.
   - Everule starts on island 1 and can visit any island that is still connected to island 1 via a series of bridges.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `k` is less than `n-1`, Dominater cannot disconnect all islands from island 1. Therefore, Everule can still visit all `n` islands.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`.
     - If `k >= n-1`, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).
     - Otherwise, it prints `n` (Everule can visit all `n` islands).

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in the program correctly handles the two cases:
     - When `k >= n-1`, Everule can only visit island 1.
     - When `k < n-1`, Everule can visit all `n` islands.
   - The program does not have any syntax errors and follows the input and output format as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.
