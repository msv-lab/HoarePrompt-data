Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \) but still large enough to isolate some islands. Specifically, the program always prints \( n \) when \( k < n - 1 \), which is incorrect. For example, consider the test case \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \):

- If Dominater destroys 3 bridges, it is possible to isolate one island from the rest. For instance, if Dominater destroys the bridges between island 1 and islands 2, 3, and 4, Everule will only be able to visit islands 1 and 5. Therefore, the correct output should be 2, but the program will output 5, which is incorrect.

This shows that the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit for all potential cases.
