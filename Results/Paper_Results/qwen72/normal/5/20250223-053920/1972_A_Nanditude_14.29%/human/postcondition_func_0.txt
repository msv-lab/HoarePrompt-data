The function `func_1` takes a single list `arr` as a parameter and returns a new list that is sorted in descending order. The function does not use the parameters `a` and `b` mentioned in the annotations, and it will result in an error if `arr` is not defined. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a new list, sorted in descending order, is returned, and the original list `arr` remains unchanged.
