### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings using `split()`.
   - It then iterates through this list to parse the number of test cases `T`, the number of signs `n` for each test case, and the periodicities `a` of the signs.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The state of the program right before the function call is correctly described. The function reads and processes the input as intended.

2. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to the periodicity of the first sign `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining signs to determine the year in which each subsequent sign will occur.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The state of the program after parsing each test case is correctly described. The variable `index` is updated appropriately, and the periodicities are correctly parsed into the list `a`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - The formula used to calculate the next year in which the i-th sign will occur is:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
   - The `last_year` is then updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The formula is correctly implemented and annotated. It ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required by the problem statement.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the results are stored in a list and written to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write`.
   - **Annotation Validation:** The state of the program after processing all test cases is correctly described. The variable `results` contains the correct years for each test case, and the output is formatted correctly.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - The formula \(\left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}\) is mathematically correct for finding the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
  - This ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required by the problem statement.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as `n = 1` and `a[i] = 1` correctly.
  - For `n = 1`, the program will output `a[0]` as the year of the first sign.
  - For `a[i] = 1`, the next year will always be `last_year + 1`.

- **Performance:**
  - The program reads the entire input at once, which is efficient for the given constraints.
  - The time complexity for each test case is \(O(n)\), which is acceptable given the constraints \(1 \le n \le 100\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially as described in the problem statement. The annotations and the original assessment are consistent and accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
