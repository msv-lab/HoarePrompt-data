Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the number of test cases, the number of signs for each test case, and the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Test Case Loop**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

3. **Sign Calculation**: The program initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`. For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
   \[
   \text{next\_year} = \left( \text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1 \right) // a[i] \times a[i]
   \]
   This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.

4. **Result Collection**: After calculating the year for the last sign, it appends the result to the `results` list.

5. **Output**: Finally, it writes all the results to `sys.stdout` with each result on a new line.

The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and calculates the year in which the last sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. Therefore, the program is correct.
