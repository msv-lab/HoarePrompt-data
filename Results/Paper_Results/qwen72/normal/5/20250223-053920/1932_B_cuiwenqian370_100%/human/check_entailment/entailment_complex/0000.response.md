### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `T` and the periodicities for each test case.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`, which is the year the first sign occurs.

3. **Calculating the Next Year:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1\right) // a[i] \times a[i]
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

4. **Updating the Last Year:**
   - The `last_year` is updated to `next_year` for each sign, ensuring that the next sign is waited for strictly after the previous sign has occurred.

5. **Storing Results:**
   - The final year for each test case is stored in the `results` list as a string.

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the results are written to standard output, each on a new line.

### Verification:

- **Example 1:**
  - `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - `last_year` starts at 3.
  - For `a[1] = 2`, `next_year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
  - For `a[2] = 4`, `next_year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
  - For `a[3] = 5`, `next_year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
  - For `a[4] = 9`, `next_year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
  - For `a[5] = 18`, `next_year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
  - The final year is 36, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 2:**
  - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `last_year` starts at 1.
  - For `a[1] = 2`, `next_year = (1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2`
  - For `a[2] = 3`, `next_year = (2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3`
  - For `a[3] = 4`, `next_year = (3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4`
  - For `a[4] = 5`, `next_year = (4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5`
  - The final year is 5, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 3:**
  - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `last_year` starts at 1.
  - For `a[1] = 1`, `next_year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 2`
  - For `a[2] = 1`, `next_year = (2 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 3`
  - For `a[3] = 1`, `next_year = (3 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 4`
  - For `a[4] = 1`, `next_year = (4 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 5`
  - The final year is 5, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 4:**
  - `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - `last_year` starts at 50.
  - For `a[1] = 30`, `next_year = (50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60`
  - For `a[2] = 711`, `next_year = (60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 711`
  - For `a[3] = 200`, `next_year = (711 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 800`
  - For `a[4] = 503`, `next_year = (800 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1006`
  - For `a[5] = 1006`, `next_year = (1006 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012`
  - The final year is 2012, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the input, calculates the required years for each test case, and outputs the results as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
