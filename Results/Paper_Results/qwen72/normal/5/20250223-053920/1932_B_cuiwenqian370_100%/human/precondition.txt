The function `main` is intended to be the entry point for the program, but the specific input variables and their relationships are not defined within the function itself. The problem description indicates that the function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The input to the function should be structured to provide these values for each test case.
