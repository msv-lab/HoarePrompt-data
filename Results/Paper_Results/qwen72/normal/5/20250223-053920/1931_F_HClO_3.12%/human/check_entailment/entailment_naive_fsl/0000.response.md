Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the order of participants in the screenshots is consistent except for the author of the screenshot being at the top. Specifically, the logic for comparing the lists `l1` and `l2` and determining the insertion points for `a1` and `a2` is flawed. It does not correctly account for all possible permutations of the participants' order.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
4 3
1 2 3 4
2 1 3 4
3 1 2 4
```
The correct output should be "YES" because the order [1, 2, 3, 4] can be consistent with the given screenshots. However, the program will output "NO" because it incorrectly determines that the lists `l1` and `l2` are not consistent after removing the authors of the screenshots.
