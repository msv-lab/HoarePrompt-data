### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Single Screenshot:**
   - If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the program immediately prints "yes" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because a single screenshot can always correspond to some order of participants.

2. **Reading the First Two Screenshots:**
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and splits them into `a1`, `l1` and `a2`, `l2`, where `a1` and `a2` are the authors of the first and second screenshots, respectively, and `l1` and `l2` are the lists of other participants as seen by `a1` and `a2`.

3. **Filtering Out the Authors:**
   - The program creates `l11` and `l22` by removing `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2`, respectively. This step is necessary to compare the order of participants without the authors.

4. **Comparing the Filtered Lists:**
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, the program prints "no" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the orders of participants (excluding the authors) are different, there cannot be a consistent order that satisfies both screenshots.

5. **Finding the Swap Indices:**
   - The program then tries to find the indices `idx1` and `idx2` where the participants `a2` and `a1` should be inserted into `l1` and `l2` to make them consistent. If `a2` and `a1` are found in the correct positions, the program sets `idx1` and `idx2` accordingly.

6. **Handling the Case with Two Screenshots:**
   - If there are only two screenshots (`m == 2`), the program prints "yes" if the indices are correctly set, otherwise it continues to the next test case. This is correct because with two screenshots, the program can determine if a consistent order exists by checking the positions of `a1` and `a2`.

7. **Handling Multiple Screenshots:**
   - For more than two screenshots, the program reads the remaining screenshots and stores them in the list `val`.
   - It then iterates through the list `val` and checks if each screenshot is consistent with the derived order `l`. If any screenshot is inconsistent, the program prints "no" and breaks out of the loop. If all screenshots are consistent, it prints "yes".

### Correctness:
The program follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly. It ensures that the order of participants is consistent across all screenshots by comparing and adjusting the lists as necessary. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
