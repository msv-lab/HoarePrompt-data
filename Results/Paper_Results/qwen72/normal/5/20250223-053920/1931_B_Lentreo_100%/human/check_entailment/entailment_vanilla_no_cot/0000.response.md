Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in the containers `nums`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to process the list of water amounts `nums` for each test case.

3. **Sum and Mean Calculation**: The function calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if this total is divisible by `n`. Since the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, this check is not strictly necessary but is included for completeness.

4. **Mean Calculation**: The function calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have if they are to be equalized.

5. **Balance Check**: The function iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running balance `curr` which is the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that it is impossible to equalize the water amounts using the allowed operations, and the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES'.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(nums)` for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem.

The logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
