Output State: **`curr` is 0.** 

Explanation: The loop iterates through each element in the `nums` list, adjusting `curr` by the difference between the current element and the mean value of the list. Since the sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n` (the length of `nums`), the mean value is an integer, and the total sum of the differences between each element and the mean over all elements is zero. This means that by the end of the loop, `curr` will be zero, as any positive or negative deviations from the mean will cancel each other out. The loop does not modify `nums`, `n`, `total`, or `mean`, so these variables remain unchanged.
