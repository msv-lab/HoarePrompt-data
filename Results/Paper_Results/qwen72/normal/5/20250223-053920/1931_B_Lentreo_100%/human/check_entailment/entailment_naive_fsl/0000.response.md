Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the function `func_1`. The program checks if the current cumulative difference `curr` becomes negative at any point and returns 'NO' if it does. However, this logic does not correctly handle all cases where it is possible to make the amounts of water in all containers the same.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3
1 5 3
```

The expected output should be "YES" because we can pour 2 units of water from the second container to the first and 1 unit from the second container to the third, resulting in all containers having 3 units of water. However, the program will return "NO" because it will detect a negative `curr` value during the iteration.

Let's break down the iteration:
- Initial `nums = [1, 5, 3]`, `mean = 3`.
- First iteration: `curr += 1 - 3 = -2` (negative, so it returns 'NO').

Thus, the program incorrectly identifies this valid case as invalid. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
