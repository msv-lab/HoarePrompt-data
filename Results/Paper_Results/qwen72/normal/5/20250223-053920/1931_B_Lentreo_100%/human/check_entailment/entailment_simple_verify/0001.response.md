### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given `n` containers with water, and the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we read the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - We need to output "YES" if it is possible to equalize the water, otherwise "NO".

3. **Key Insight**:
   - Since the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is `mean = total // n`.
   - The operation allows us to pour water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.
   - To achieve the target, we need to ensure that the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean does not go negative at any point. If it does, it means we cannot redistribute the water to achieve the target.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - It calls `func_1` with the list of water amounts.
   - `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and the mean.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr`.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns "NO".
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns "YES".

5. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - **State before function call**: `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers, where the length of `nums` (n) is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` in `nums` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`.
   - **State after calculating `total` and `mean`**: `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `mean` is the target amount of water in each container, which is `total // n`. The condition `total % n == 0` is guaranteed by the problem statement.
   - **State during the loop**: `curr` is initialized to 0 and is updated by adding the difference between the current amount of water in the container and the mean. If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means that the cumulative amount of water in the containers up to that point is less than the cumulative target amount, which implies that it is impossible to redistribute the water to achieve the target.
   - **State after the loop**: If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that the cumulative amount of water in the containers is always at least the cumulative target amount, and thus it is possible to redistribute the water to achieve the target.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the mean and checks if the cumulative difference goes negative.
   - The logic ensures that if the cumulative difference is non-negative throughout the iteration, it is possible to redistribute the water to achieve the target amount in each container.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as `n = 1` and cases where the water amounts are already equal.

7. **Challenges to the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified the key insights and the logic of the program.
   - The annotations in the code align with the reasoning provided in the assessment.
   - No logical errors or edge cases were overlooked in the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
