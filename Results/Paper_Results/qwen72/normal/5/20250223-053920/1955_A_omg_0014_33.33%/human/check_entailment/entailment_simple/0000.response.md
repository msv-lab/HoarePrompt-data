Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used in the program, but according to the problem description, the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `c` is not defined in the problem statement and seems to be a mistake. The promotional price for two yogurts should be stored in `b`, not `c`.

2. **Calculation of `d`**: The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is incorrect. The promotional price for two yogurts is `b`, so the cost per yogurt when buying two at the promotional price should be `b / 2`.

3. **Comparison and Output**: The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. It should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`) with the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotional price as much as possible. The correct logic should involve calculating how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotional price and the cost of any remaining yogurts at the regular price.

4. **Input Handling**: The function should read the number of test cases `t` and then iterate `t` times, not `n` times. The variable `n` is the number of yogurts for each test case, not the number of test cases.

5. **Rounding**: The use of `round(a * d)` is unnecessary and incorrect. The cost should be an integer, and the rounding should not be applied in this context.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
