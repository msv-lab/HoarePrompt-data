The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then calculates `d` as `c / 2`. If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`; otherwise, it prints the rounded value of `a * d`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from the input for each test case.
