### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Variable Naming**:
   - The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from the input, but the problem description uses `n`, `a`, and `b` for the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts, respectively.
   - The program uses `a` for the number of yogurts, `b` for the price of one yogurt, and `c` for the price of two yogurts, which is inconsistent with the problem description.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which is the price of one yogurt if bought at the promotion price.
   - It then compares `a * b` (the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price) with `a * d` (the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price).
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

4. **Logical Error**:
   - The comparison `a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The program should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price.
   - The correct comparison should be between `n * a` (cost of `n` yogurts at the regular price) and `n // 2 * c + (n % 2) * a` (cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, but the logic used to determine the minimum cost is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses the wrong variables and the wrong logic to determine the minimum cost.

**Correctness: False**
