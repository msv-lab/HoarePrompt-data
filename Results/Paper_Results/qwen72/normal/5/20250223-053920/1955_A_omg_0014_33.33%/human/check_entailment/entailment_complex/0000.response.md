### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. However, the variable names `a`, `b`, and `c` are not consistent with the problem description. According to the problem, `a` should be the price of one yogurt, `b` should be the price of two yogurts on promotion, and `n` should be the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy. The function incorrectly uses `a`, `b`, and `c` instead of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is intended to be the price of one yogurt if bought at the promotion price. However, this calculation is incorrect because `c` is not the promotion price for two yogurts; it should be `b`.
   - The function then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This comparison is also incorrect because `a * b` should be the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price, and `a * d` should be the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the promotion price. The correct comparison should be between `n * a` and `n // 2 * b + (n % 2) * a`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result of the comparison, but the logic is flawed. It should print the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts, which is the smaller of `n * a` (buying all yogurts at the regular price) and `n // 2 * b + (n % 2) * a` (buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price).

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it misinterprets the input variables and performs incorrect calculations to determine the minimum cost. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed, and the variable names do not match the problem description.
