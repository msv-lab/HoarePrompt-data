The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and a_j = 1 if the resident wants to live on the right side. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
