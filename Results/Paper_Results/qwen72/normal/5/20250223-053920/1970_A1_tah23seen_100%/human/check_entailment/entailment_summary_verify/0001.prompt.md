You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` reordered based on the depth of the parentheses sequence at each position. The reordering is such that characters at the same depth are ordered by their original position in reverse (i.e., from right to left). The original string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the input string `n` and immediately calls `func_1(n)`. This is correct as the input is a single balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a dictionary `d` to store the prefix balance at each position.
   - It sets `d[0] = 0` to handle the initial balance before any characters are processed.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - This part is correct as it correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position.

3. **Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary using `d.pop(n)`. This is necessary because the balance at the end of the string (position `n`) is not needed for the sorting step.
   - It then sorts the dictionary items based on the prefix balance in ascending order and, in case of ties, by position in descending order. This is correct as it follows the problem description.

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It iterates through the sorted dictionary items and appends the corresponding character from the input string `s` to `ans`.
   - This part is correct as it constructs the balanced shuffle by following the sorted positions.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

### Potential Issues:
- **Indexing Error**: The program uses `ans += s[i]` to construct the result. However, `i` in the sorted dictionary items is the position in the input string, which is 1-based. The correct way to access the character in the string should be `ans += s[i-1]` because Python strings are 0-based indexed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i - 1]  # Corrected to use 0-based indexing
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a minor indexing error. After correcting the indexing, the program is correct.

Correctness: **False** (due to the indexing error, but can be corrected to **True** with the fix mentioned above).
