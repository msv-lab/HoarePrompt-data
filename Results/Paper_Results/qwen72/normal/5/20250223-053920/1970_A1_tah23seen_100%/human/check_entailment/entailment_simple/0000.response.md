### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the input string `n` and immediately calls `func_1(n)`. This is correct as the input is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Dictionary Initialization**: Inside `func_1`, the dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`. This is a good start because it sets the initial balance to 0, which is correct for an empty prefix.

3. **Balance Calculation**: The program then iterates over the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
   - If the character is '(', the balance is increased by 1.
   - If the character is ')', the balance is decreased by 1.
   This correctly calculates the balance of the prefix ending at each position.

4. **Final Balance Check**: After the loop, the program removes the last entry from the dictionary using `d.pop(n)`. This is necessary because the balance at the end of the string (position `n`) is always 0, and we only need the balances up to the second-to-last position.

5. **Sorting the Dictionary**: The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the balance values, and in case of ties, by the negative position index. This ensures that the positions are sorted in increasing order of balance and, for the same balance, in decreasing order of position. This is the correct approach to achieve the balanced shuffle as described in the problem.

6. **Constructing the Result**: The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from `s` in the order specified by the sorted positions in `d`. This is the correct way to form the balanced shuffle.

7. **Output**: Finally, the program returns the constructed string `ans`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. It correctly calculates the balance of each prefix, sorts the positions based on the balance and position, and constructs the result string accordingly.

**Correctness: True**
