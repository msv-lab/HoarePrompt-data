The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string `ans` which contains the characters from `s` in the order specified by the positions in the sorted list `d`. The list `d` is sorted by the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence at each position, with ties broken by the negative position index.

Functionality: **The function accepts a balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` containing the characters from `s` reordered based on the depth of the parentheses sequence at each position, with ties broken by the negative position index.**
