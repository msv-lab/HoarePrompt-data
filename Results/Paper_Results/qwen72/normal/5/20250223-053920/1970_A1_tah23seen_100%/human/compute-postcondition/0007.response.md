Output State: **`s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is still the length of `s`, `ans` is still an empty string, and `d` is now a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence at each position, with ties broken by the negative position index. The key `n` is no longer present in `d`.**

Explanation:
- The dictionary `d` is converted into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from `d`.
- The list of tuples is sorted first by the depth (value) in ascending order.
- If two positions have the same depth, they are sorted by the negative position index (key) in descending order, which effectively sorts them by the position index in ascending order.
- The key `n` is removed from `d` as part of the sorting process, so it is no longer present in the sorted list.
- The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
