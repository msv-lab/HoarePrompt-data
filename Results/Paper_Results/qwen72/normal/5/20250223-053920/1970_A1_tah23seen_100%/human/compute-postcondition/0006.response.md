The code `d.pop(n)` removes the key-value pair where the key is `n` from the dictionary `d`. Since `d[n]` is specified to be 0, this key-value pair is removed from the dictionary. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is still the length of `s`, `ans` is still an empty string, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` represents the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence at position `i-1` in `s`, with the key `n` removed.**
