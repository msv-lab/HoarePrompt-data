#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.

    #State: `s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is still the length of `s`, `ans` is still an empty string, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` represents the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence at position `i-1` in `s`. The final value of `d[n]` will be 0, as the sequence is balanced.

    #State: `s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is still the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` in the order specified by the positions in `d`, and `d` is still a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence at each position, with ties broken by the negative position index.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which contains the characters from `s` in the order specified by the positions in the sorted list `d`. The list `d` is sorted by the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence at each position, with ties broken by the negative position index.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` reordered based on the depth of the parentheses sequence at each position. The reordering is such that characters at the same depth are ordered by their original position in reverse (i.e., from right to left). The original string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged.
