Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not accurately calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The key issue lies in the implementation of `func_1`, which sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which is the opposite of what is needed to maximize the beauty.
- **Sum of Absolute Differences**: The function calculates the sum of the absolute differences, which is not the same as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})`. The absolute differences will always be non-negative, whereas the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` can be positive or negative.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty of the array, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in descending order. This ensures that the largest elements are placed at the beginning of the array, and the smallest elements are placed at the end. The differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` will then be maximized, as the largest elements will be subtracted from the smallest elements.

### Example Cases:
1. **Input: `n = 3`, `array = [2, 1, 3]`**
   - **Expected Output**: `2` (achievable by the arrangement `[3, 1, 2]` or `[1, 3, 2]`)
   - **Actual Output**: `2` (achieved by the sorted array `[1, 2, 3]`)
   - **Explanation**: The program happens to produce the correct output for this case, but it is not due to the correct logic.

2. **Input: `n = 4`, `array = [3, 4, 3, 3]`**
   - **Expected Output**: `1` (achievable by the arrangement `[4, 3, 3, 3]` or `[3, 3, 3, 4]`)
   - **Actual Output**: `3` (achieved by the sorted array `[3, 3, 3, 4]`)
   - **Explanation**: The program fails here because sorting the array in ascending order does not maximize the beauty. The correct approach would be to sort the array in descending order to achieve the maximum beauty.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic in `func_1` is flawed because it sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the sum of absolute differences, which does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
