The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it starts from 0 by default. The other variables (`data`, `index`, `results`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
