### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty.

2. **Analyzing Function 1:**
   - `func_1(array)` sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The original assessment correctly identified that this approach is incorrect because sorting the array minimizes the differences between consecutive elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty.
   - To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by arranging the array in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest elements.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The corrected function provided in the original assessment rearranges the array in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest elements.
   - For example, if the sorted array is \([a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]\), it should be rearranged to \([a_1, a_n, a_2, a_{n-1}, \ldots]\).
   - This way, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be maximized, leading to the maximum beauty.

4. **Analyzing Function 2:**
   - `func_2()` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases and the length of each array.
   - It correctly calls `func_1(array)` to calculate the beauty for each test case.
   - However, since the original `func_1(array)` was incorrect, the overall program will not produce the correct results.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program is incorrect because `func_1(array)` does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array.
   - The corrected function provided in the original assessment is the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the program and provided a corrected approach. Therefore, the final evaluation is that the given program is incorrect.
