Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, the problem requires the maximum beauty, which is achieved by maximizing the positive differences between consecutive elements. Sorting the array in ascending order does not necessarily achieve this.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array elements.
   - The function calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty for each test case and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

**Issues:**
- **Function 1:** The sorting approach in `func_1` is incorrect. To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by alternating the largest and smallest elements in the array.
- **Function 2:** The input handling is correct, but since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program will not produce the correct results.

**Correct Approach:**
- To maximize the beauty, you should rearrange the array such that the largest and smallest elements alternate. This can be done by sorting the array and then interleaving the elements from the start and end of the sorted array.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty
```

However, to achieve the maximum beauty, the correct approach is to sort the array and then interleave the largest and smallest elements:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    n = len(array)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        beauty += array[n - 1 - i] - array[i]
    return beauty * 2 - (array[n // 2] - array[n // 2 - 1]) if n % 2 == 1 else beauty * 2
```

This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
