To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`.

1. **`results`**: This is the list that the loop will iterate over. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.
2. **`result`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `results` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts, as it will be assigned values by the loop itself.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` remains the same, representing the number of test cases.
- `index` is updated to the value `1 + t * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the length of the array in the last test case.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` applied to each array from the test cases.
- `data` remains unchanged, still containing the original list of strings.

To ensure the loop executes, `results` must have at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `index`, `data`) do not directly affect the loop's execution and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
