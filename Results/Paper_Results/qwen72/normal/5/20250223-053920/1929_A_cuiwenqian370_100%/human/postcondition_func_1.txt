The function `func_2` reads a series of test cases from `sys.stdin`. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case by applying `func_1` to the array of integers and collects the results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result to the console. The variable `t` remains unchanged, representing the number of test cases. The variable `index` is updated to the value `1 + t * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the length of the array in the last test case. The variable `data` remains unchanged, still containing the original list of strings.
