The function `func` reads input from the user, where the first input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string `s` of `n` characters representing a path. The path consists of '.', '@', and '*' characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The function then processes each path and prints the number of coins ('@') collected before encountering two consecutive thorns ('*'). If two consecutive thorns are encountered, the function stops processing the current path and prints the count of coins collected up to that point. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
