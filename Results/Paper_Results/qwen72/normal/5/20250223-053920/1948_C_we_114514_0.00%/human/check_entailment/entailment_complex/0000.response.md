Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case, storing them in a list `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing the integer `n` and the two strings representing the rows of the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - It initializes two boolean variables: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.
   - The loop iterates over each column index `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If the robot is currently on the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell of the first row points to the right (`>`), the robot can potentially move to the next column.
     - If the robot reaches the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move to the second row.
     - If the arrow points to the left (`<`), the robot can no longer stay on the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
     - If the robot is on the first row and the arrow points to the left, but the next cell in the second row points to the right, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` to indicate the robot can move to the second row.
   - If the robot is currently on the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell of the second row points to the right (`>`), the robot can potentially move to the next column.
     - If the robot reaches the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` to indicate the robot can stay on the second row.
   - After the loop, the function appends 'YES' to the results if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Output**: The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 2, which is the smallest valid grid size.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the robot can move back and forth between rows, ensuring it can reach the last column of the second row.

5. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The logic for updating `reachable_second_row` when the robot is on the first row and encounters a left arrow is flawed. The robot should be able to move to the second row if the arrow in the second row points to the right, but the current logic does not correctly handle this transition.
   - The logic for updating `reachable_first_row` when the robot is on the second row and encounters a left arrow is missing. The robot should be able to move to the first row if the arrow in the first row points to the right, but the current logic does not account for this.

Given these logical flaws, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
