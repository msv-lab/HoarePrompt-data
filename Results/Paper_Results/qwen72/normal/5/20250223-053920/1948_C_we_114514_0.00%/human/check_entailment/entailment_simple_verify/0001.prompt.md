You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `row1` and `row2`.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes two boolean variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to keep track of whether the robot can reach the last cell in the first and second rows, respectively.
   - The robot starts in the first row at the first column, so `reachable_first_row` is initially set to `True`.

3. **Movement Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If the robot is currently in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row).
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - The robot cannot move further in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
       - If the robot is not at the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the corresponding cell in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row).
   - If the robot is currently in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (this is redundant but doesn't affect correctness).

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it means the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`, and the program appends `YES` to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends `NO`.

### Issues:
- **Redundant Check:**
  - The check `if j == n - 1: reachable_second_row = True` in the second row processing is redundant because `reachable_second_row` is already `True` if the robot reaches the second row. This does not affect the correctness of the program but can be optimized.
- **Logical Flaw:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the robot can move between rows. Specifically, it does not account for the possibility that the robot can move from the second row back to the first row and continue moving right.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly handle the movement between rows, which is a critical part of the problem. The robot can move between rows multiple times, and the current logic does not account for this.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be modified to correctly handle the movement between rows and ensure that the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` by considering all possible movements.
