Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and checking if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) based on the arrows in the grid. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Initialization and Looping**:
   - The program correctly initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` because the robot starts in the first row.
   - It initializes `reachable_second_row` to `False` because the robot hasn't moved to the second row yet.

2. **Movement Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each column of the grid.
   - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), it checks if the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`). If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the left (`<`), it sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` and checks if the robot can move to the second row by checking if the arrow in the second row at the same column points to the right (`>`). If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the robot is in the second row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), it checks if the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`). If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After iterating through all columns, the program checks if `reachable_second_row` is `True` and appends 'YES' to the results if it is, otherwise 'NO'.

However, there are some logical issues in the movement checks:
- The program does not correctly handle the movement of the robot when it is in the second row and the arrow points to the left (`<`).
- The program does not correctly handle the movement of the robot when it is in the first row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), especially when the robot is not at the last column.

To correct these issues, the program should:
- Check if the robot can move to the second row when it is in the first row and the arrow points to the right (`>`).
- Check if the robot can move to the first row when it is in the second row and the arrow points to the left (`<`).

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j + 1] == '<':
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        results.append('YES')
                        break
                else:
                    reachable_second_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row1[j] == '<':
                        reachable_first_row = True
        if not reachable_second_row:
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

Given the original program, the logic is flawed and does not correctly handle all possible movements of the robot. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
