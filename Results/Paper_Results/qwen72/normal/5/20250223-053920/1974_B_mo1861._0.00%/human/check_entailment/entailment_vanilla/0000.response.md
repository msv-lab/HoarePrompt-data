### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num_test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `num_chars` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Character Mapping:**
   - The program constructs a character mapping `char_map` from the sorted set of characters in the encoded string `b`.
   - The mapping is created by associating each character in the sorted set with its symmetric character in the set. For example, if `b` contains the characters "cdefors", the mapping would be:
     - 'c' -> 's'
     - 'd' -> 'r'
     - 'e' -> 'o'
     - 'f' -> 'n'
     - 'o' -> 'e'
     - 'r' -> 'd'
     - 's' -> 'c'
   - This is done using the `enumerate` function to get the index `i` of each character `c` in the sorted set, and then mapping it to the character at position `len(b) - i - 1` in the sorted set.

3. **Decoding:**
   - The program then decodes the string `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.
   - The decoded string `s` is constructed by iterating over each character in `b` and appending the mapped character to `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - The decoded string `s` is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Character Mapping Length:**
  - The mapping `char_map` is created based on the length of the set of characters in `b`, not the length of the string `b` itself. This means that the symmetric mapping is based on the number of unique characters, not the total length of the string.
  - For example, if `b` is "serofedsoc", the set of characters is "cdefors" (6 unique characters), and the mapping should be:
    - 'c' -> 's'
    - 'd' -> 'r'
    - 'e' -> 'o'
    - 'f' -> 'n'
    - 'o' -> 'e'
    - 'r' -> 'd'
    - 's' -> 'c'
  - The program correctly handles this by using `len(set(b))` to determine the length of the set of unique characters.

- **Character Mapping Construction:**
  - The program correctly constructs the `char_map` by mapping each character to its symmetric character in the sorted set.
  - However, the mapping should be based on the position in the sorted set, not the position in the string `b`.

- **Decoding Process:**
  - The program correctly decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach to decoding the string based on the provided problem description. The character mapping is correctly constructed and used to decode the string.

### Correctness:
**True**
