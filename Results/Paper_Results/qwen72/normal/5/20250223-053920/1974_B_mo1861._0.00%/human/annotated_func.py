#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced by a corresponding lowercase Latin letter based on a reverse mapping of the unique characters in `b`. The unique characters in `b` are sorted in ascending order, and the last character in this sorted list is mapped to 'a', the second last to 'b', and so on. The original string `b` and the `char_map` dictionary remain unchanged after the function execution.
