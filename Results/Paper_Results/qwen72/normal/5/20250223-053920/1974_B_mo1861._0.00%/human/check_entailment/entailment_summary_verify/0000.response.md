Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The issue with the provided program lies in the way the `char_map` is constructed. According to the problem description, the decoding process should involve creating a symmetric mapping based on the distinct characters in the string `b`, not based on the entire alphabet.

Let's break down the problem and the provided code:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - Construct a new auxiliary string `r` consisting of all distinct letters of the string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Provided Code**:
   - The code constructs a `char_map` where each character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character that is symmetric in the range from 'a' to 'z'.
   - This is incorrect because the mapping should be based on the distinct characters in `b`, not the entire alphabet.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` creates a mapping from each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character that is symmetric in the range from 'a' to 'z'.
   - This does not align with the problem description, which requires the mapping to be based on the distinct characters in `b`.

4. **Example**:
   - For the input `b = "serofedsoc"`, the correct decoding should be `"codeforces"`.
   - The provided code will produce a different result because it maps characters based on their position in the alphabet, not their position in the sorted set of distinct characters in `b`.

The corrected version of the function, as suggested in the original assessment, is:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {distinct_chars[i]: distinct_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

This corrected function will correctly decode the string as per the problem description by creating a symmetric mapping based on the distinct characters in `b`.

Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate, and the provided program is incorrect. The program should be updated to use the correct symmetric mapping based on the distinct characters in the input string `b`.
