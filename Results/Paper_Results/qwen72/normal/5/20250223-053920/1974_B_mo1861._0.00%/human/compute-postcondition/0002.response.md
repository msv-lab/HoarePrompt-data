To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head: `i`, `c`, and the expression `sorted(set(b))`.

1. **`b`**: The string `b` is already defined as a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5. This means `b` is not empty and contains at least one character. Therefore, `set(b)` will not be empty, and `sorted(set(b))` will produce a non-empty list of unique characters from `b`.

2. **`i`**: The variable `i` is the index that will be generated by the `enumerate` function. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.

3. **`c`**: The variable `c` will be the first character in the sorted list of unique characters from `b`. Before the loop starts, `c` should be the first character in `sorted(set(b))`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. The loop will execute if `b` is not empty, and `i` and `c` are set correctly.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, `c` is the first character in `sorted(set(b))`**
