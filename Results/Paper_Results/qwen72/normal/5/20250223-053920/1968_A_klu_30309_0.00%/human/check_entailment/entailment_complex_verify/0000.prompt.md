You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    #State: `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is the largest integer divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1, but if there is a divisor `y` such that 2 * y >= x, then `max_val` is that divisor.
    return max_val
    #The program returns the largest integer divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1, but if there is a divisor `y` such that 2 * y >= x, then the program returns that divisor `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (where 2 <= x <= 1000) and returns the largest integer divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1. If there is a divisor `y` such that 2 * y >= x, it returns that divisor `y`. If no such divisor exists, it returns 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `x` is a prime number correctly. According to the problem description, for a prime number `x`, the optimal `y` should be `1` because `gcd(x, 1) + 1 = 2`, which is the maximum possible value since `x` has no divisors other than `1` and itself. However, the program's logic in `func_1` will return `1` only if no other `y` is found that satisfies `x % y == 0`. This is incorrect because the loop starts from `x - 1` and goes down to `2`, and it will never find a `y` that satisfies `x % y == 0` for a prime `x` (other than `1`), but it will not return `1` as the optimal `y`.

Example input where the program fails:
```
Input:
3
10
7
6

Output:
5
1
3
```

For `x = 7` (a prime number), the program should return `1` as the optimal `y`, but it returns `1` only because the loop completes without finding any other valid `y`. This is not the intended behavior, and the program should explicitly return `1` for prime numbers.
