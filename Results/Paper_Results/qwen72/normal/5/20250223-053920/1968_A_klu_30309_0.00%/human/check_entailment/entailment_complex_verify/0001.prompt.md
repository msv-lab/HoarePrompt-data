You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (where 2 <= x <= 1000) and returns the largest integer divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1. If there is a divisor `y` such that 2 * y >= x, it returns that divisor `y`. If no such divisor exists, it returns 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) is the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and calls the function `func_1(x)` to find the optimal \( y \).
   - The function `func_1(x)` works as follows:
     - It initializes `max_val` to 1.
     - It iterates over \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
     - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)), it checks if \( 2 * y \ge x \).
     - If \( 2 * y \ge x \), it returns \( y \) immediately.
     - Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to \( y \).
     - Finally, it returns `max_val`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm aims to find the largest \( y \) such that \( x \% y == 0 \) and \( 2 * y \ge x \).
   - If \( x \% y == 0 \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \). Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = y + y = 2 * y \).
   - The condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) ensures that \( y \) is as large as possible while still being a divisor of \( x \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, the algorithm returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \), which is \( x-1 \) if \( x \) is prime.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 3 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 4 \), the possible \( y \) values are 1 and 2. The optimal \( y \) is 2, and \( \gcd(4, 2) + 2 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 10 \), the possible \( y \) values are 1, 2, 5. The optimal \( y \) is 5, and \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \).

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases and the general case.
   - The logic ensures that the largest possible \( y \) is chosen, which maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It finds the optimal \( y \) for each test case and prints it.

Correctness: **True**
