Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n < m`. According to the problem description, if `n < m`, it is impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the program only checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. This means that for cases where `n < m`, the program will incorrectly output "NO" instead of "Yes" when `n` is odd and `m` is 1 (e.g., `n = 1` and `m = 1`).

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1 1
```
The expected output is "Yes" because Nikita can build a tower with 1 cube in 1 move. However, the program will output "NO" because it does not handle the case where `n < m` correctly.
