You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two integers n and m where 1 <= n, m <= 100. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases t such that 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, the output will be 'YES' if n is greater than or equal to m and the difference (n - m) is even, otherwise the output will be 'NO'. The values of n and m for each test case are processed and then discarded, so they do not persist after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, where both are between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 100) and then, for each test case, it prints 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `n` and `m` for each test case are discarded.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n < m`. According to the problem description, if `n < m`, it is impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the program only checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. This means that for cases where `n < m`, the program will incorrectly output "NO" instead of "Yes" when `n` is odd and `m` is 1 (e.g., `n = 1` and `m = 1`).

For example, if the input is:
```
1
1 1
```
The expected output is "Yes" because Nikita can build a tower with 1 cube in 1 move. However, the program will output "NO" because it does not handle the case where `n < m` correctly.
