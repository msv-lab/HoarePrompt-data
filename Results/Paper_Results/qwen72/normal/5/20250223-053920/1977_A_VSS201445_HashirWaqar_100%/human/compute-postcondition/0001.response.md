Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, the output will be 'YES' if n is greater than or equal to m and the difference (n - m) is even, otherwise the output will be 'NO'. The values of n and m for each test case are processed and then discarded, so they do not persist after the loop.**
