### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Check**: The function checks two conditions:
   - `n >= m`: This ensures that Nikita has enough moves to build a tower of height `m`.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the number of moves left after building a tower of height `m` is even. This is because each move can either add or remove a cube, and the total number of moves must be even to balance out the additions and removals to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

3. **Output**: The function prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, and 'NO' otherwise. This is consistent with the problem description and the example provided.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge cases correctly:
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to build a tower of height `m` with only `n` moves.
   - If `n` is equal to `m`, the function correctly prints 'YES' because Nikita can build the tower in exactly `n` moves.
   - If `n` is greater than `m` but the difference is odd, the function correctly prints 'NO' because the remaining moves cannot balance out to leave exactly `m` cubes.

5. **Multiple Test Cases**: The function processes multiple test cases correctly by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.

### Correctness:
**True**
