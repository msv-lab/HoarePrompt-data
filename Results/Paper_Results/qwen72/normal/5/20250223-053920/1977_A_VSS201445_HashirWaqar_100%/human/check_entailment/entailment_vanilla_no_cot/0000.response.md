Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.
3. The condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:` checks two things:
   - `n >= m`: This ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the desired number of cubes, which is necessary because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is because each move can either add or remove a cube, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes, the net number of additions must equal the net number of removals, which can only happen if the difference is even.

If both conditions are met, the program prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The example test cases provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program:
- For `n = 3` and `m = 3`, the program prints "YES" because 3 moves can all be additions.
- For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the program prints "NO" because it's impossible to add 4 cubes in only 2 moves.
- For `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the program prints "YES" because 5 moves can be 3 additions and 2 removals, or 4 additions and 1 removal, etc.

Thus, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
