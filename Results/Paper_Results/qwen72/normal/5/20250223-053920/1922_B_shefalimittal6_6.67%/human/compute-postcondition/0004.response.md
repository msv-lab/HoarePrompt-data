Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. The function calculates the number of valid triplets of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and a[i] = a[j] = a[k], and the number of valid pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and a[i] = a[j], multiplied by the count of all other distinct elements in the list. The result for each test case is printed to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program returns to its calling context. **
