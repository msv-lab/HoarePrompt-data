Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the conditions required to form a non-degenerate triangle with the given stick lengths. Specifically, the program is using a combination formula to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks, but it is not checking the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

For the given problem, the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, which means that the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if the lengths of the three chosen sticks are the same (i.e., all three sticks have the same power of 2). This is because the sum of any two different powers of 2 will always be less than the next higher power of 2, making it impossible to satisfy the triangle inequality theorem with different lengths.

The program, however, counts combinations of sticks with the same length and combinations of sticks where two lengths are the same and the third is different, which is incorrect. The correct approach should only count the combinations where all three sticks have the same length.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num_of_lens = {}
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        res = 0
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
        print(res)
```

This version only counts the combinations where all three sticks have the same length, which is the correct approach for this problem.
