You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num_of_lens = {}
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        res = 0
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2:
                total_sum = sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt))
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. The function calculates the number of valid triplets of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and a[i] = a[j] = a[k], and the number of valid pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and a[i] = a[j], multiplied by the count of all other distinct elements in the list. The result for each test case is printed to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program returns to its calling context.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is an efficient way to group the sticks by their lengths.

3. **Triangle Formation Conditions**: 
   - A triangle can be formed if and only if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.
   - Given the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2 (`2^{a_i}`), the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if the lengths of the three sticks are the same. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 is always less than or equal to the next power of 2, and thus cannot satisfy the triangle inequality with a larger stick.

4. **Counting Valid Triangles**:
   - The program checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length. If so, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these using the combination formula `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - The program also checks if there are at least 2 sticks of the same length. If so, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these and one stick from the remaining sticks using the combination formula `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the total number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program step by step:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `7`, `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - All sticks have the same length `2^1 = 2`.
  - The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is `math.comb(7, 3) = 35`.
  - The program correctly outputs `35`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `4`, `3 2 1 3`
  - Stick lengths are `2^3 = 8`, `2^2 = 4`, `2^1 = 2`, `2^3 = 8`.
  - There are 2 sticks of length 8 and 1 stick of length 4 and 2.
  - The number of ways to choose 2 sticks of length 8 and 1 stick of any other length is `math.comb(2, 2) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2`.
  - The program correctly outputs `2`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
  - Stick lengths are `2^1 = 2`, `2^2 = 4`, `2^3 = 8`.
  - No three sticks have the same length, and no combination of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
  - The program correctly outputs `0`.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `1`, `1`
  - Only one stick is given, so it is impossible to form a triangle.
  - The program correctly outputs `0`.

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly counts the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles using the given constraints and conditions.
