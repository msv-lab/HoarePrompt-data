### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `a` (which are the exponents of 2).

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The function uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length (exponent).

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - The function correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length.
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if there are at least 2 sticks of the same length.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the sum of the valid combinations calculated.

5. **Triangle Inequality**:
   - The function implicitly handles the triangle inequality by only considering combinations of sticks where the lengths are powers of 2. For any three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\), a non-degenerate triangle can only be formed if \(a_i = a_j = a_k\). This is because the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side, and for powers of 2, this is only possible if all three exponents are the same.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where there are fewer than 3 sticks of the same length by not adding any combinations to the result.
   - It also handles cases where there are no valid combinations (e.g., all sticks have different lengths) by printing 0.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle based on the given problem description. The input handling, combination calculations, and output are all correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
