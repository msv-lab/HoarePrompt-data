Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from a given set of sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\) such that a non-degenerate triangle can be formed. A non-degenerate triangle can be formed if and only if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `nums`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length \(a_i\).

3. **Triangle Formation Logic**:
   - The program calculates the number of valid triplets (i.e., three sticks of the same length) using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} \) where `cnt` is the count of a particular stick length.
   - The program also calculates the number of valid pairs (i.e., two sticks of the same length) and multiplies this by the count of all other distinct elements to form a valid triplet.

### Issues:
- **Triangle Inequality Theorem**:
  - The program does not explicitly check the triangle inequality theorem for different lengths. However, for sticks of lengths \(2^{a_i}\), the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if at least two sticks have the same length. This is because:
    - If all three sticks have different lengths, say \(2^a\), \(2^b\), and \(2^c\) with \(a < b < c\), then \(2^a + 2^b \leq 2^c\), which violates the triangle inequality.
    - If at least two sticks have the same length, say \(2^a\) and \(2^a\), and the third stick has a length \(2^b\) with \(b > a\), then \(2^a + 2^a > 2^b\) if and only if \(b = a + 1\).

- **Combination Calculation**:
  - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
  - The program also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `7` sticks with lengths `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - All sticks have the same length \(2^1 = 2\).
  - The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).
  - The program correctly outputs `35`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `4` sticks with lengths `[3, 2, 1, 3]`.
  - There are 2 sticks of length \(2^3 = 8\) and 1 stick each of lengths \(2^2 = 4\) and \(2^1 = 2\).
  - The valid triplets are (1, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 4), which the program correctly counts as `2`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `3` sticks with lengths `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - The lengths are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\).
  - No valid triplets can be formed because \(2 + 4 \leq 8\).
  - The program correctly outputs `0`.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `1` stick with length `[1]`.
  - Only one stick is given, so no triplets can be formed.
  - The program correctly outputs `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem by counting the valid triplets and pairs that can form a non-degenerate triangle. It adheres to the constraints and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
