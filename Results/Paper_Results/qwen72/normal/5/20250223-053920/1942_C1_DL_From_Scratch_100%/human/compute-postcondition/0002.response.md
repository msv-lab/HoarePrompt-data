Output State: **The loop will execute `T` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, sort the list of chosen vertices, and then calculate and print the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices, plus `x - 2`. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, and `count` will be re-initialized for each test case, and the final state of these variables will be the values from the last test case.**
