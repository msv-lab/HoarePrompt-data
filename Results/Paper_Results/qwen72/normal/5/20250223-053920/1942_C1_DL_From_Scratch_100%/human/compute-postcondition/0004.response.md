Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It then sorts this list and calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices, plus `x - 2`. The function prints this result for each test case. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, and `count` are re-initialized for each test case, and the final state of these variables will be the values from the last test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
