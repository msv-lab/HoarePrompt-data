You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. It should accept parameters for the number of test cases, the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. The correct function definition should be: `def func(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (which is 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())

        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        count = 0

            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `T` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, sort the list of chosen vertices, and then calculate and print the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices, plus `x - 2`. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, and `count` will be re-initialized for each test case, and the final state of these variables will be the values from the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It then sorts this list and calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices, plus `x - 2`. The function prints this result for each test case. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, and `count` are re-initialized for each test case, and the final state of these variables will be the values from the last test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bessie has a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - She has chosen \( x \) vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - The constraint \( y = 0 \) means we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A triangle is formed by three vertices of the polygon.
   - To form non-intersecting triangles, we need to ensure that the diagonals do not cross each other.
   - The number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from a set of vertices is given by the number of vertices minus 2.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It then reads the \( x \) chosen vertices and sorts them.
   - The program initializes a counter `count` to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices and counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices.
   - It also checks the gap between the last and the first vertex, considering the circular nature of the polygon.
   - Finally, it prints the total number of triangles, which is `count + x - 2`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from \( x \) vertices is \( x - 2 \).
   - The program correctly counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices and adds this to \( x - 2 \).
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the polygon is fully triangulated. For example, if all \( n \) vertices are chosen, the number of triangles should be \( n - 2 \).

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), \( y = 0 \)
     - Chosen vertices: \( 1, 6, 2, 5 \)
     - Sorted vertices: \( 1, 2, 5, 6 \)
     - Gaps of size 1: \( (2 - 1 - 1) = 0 \), \( (5 - 2 - 1) = 2 \), \( (6 - 5 - 1) = 0 \), \( (1 + 8 - 6 - 1) = 2 \)
     - Total triangles: \( 0 + 4 - 2 = 2 \)
     - **Expected Output:** 2
     - **Actual Output:** 2
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - \( n = 8 \), \( x = 8 \), \( y = 0 \)
     - Chosen vertices: \( 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8 \)
     - Sorted vertices: \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \)
     - Gaps of size 1: \( (2 - 1 - 1) = 0 \), \( (3 - 2 - 1) = 0 \), \( (4 - 3 - 1) = 0 \), \( (5 - 4 - 1) = 0 \), \( (6 - 5 - 1) = 0 \), \( (7 - 6 - 1) = 0 \), \( (8 - 7 - 1) = 0 \), \( (1 + 8 - 8 - 1) = 0 \)
     - Total triangles: \( 0 + 8 - 2 = 6 \)
     - **Expected Output:** 6
     - **Actual Output:** 6
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), \( y = 0 \)
     - Chosen vertices: \( 1, 3 \)
     - Sorted vertices: \( 1, 3 \)
     - Gaps of size 1: \( (3 - 1 - 1) = 1 \), \( (1 + 4 - 3 - 1) = 1 \)
     - Total triangles: \( 1 + 2 - 2 = 1 \)
     - **Expected Output:** 2
     - **Actual Output:** 2

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given test cases and the logic for counting the number of non-intersecting triangles is sound. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where all \( n \) vertices are chosen, but this is not a concern since \( y = 0 \) and \( x \leq n \).

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
