Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (which is 0 in this version), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a list of results for each test case, where each result indicates whether it is possible to form a polygon with the chosen vertices and the maximum number of additional vertices allowed.**
