Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input. It then generates a string `s` composed of the first `k` lowercase English letters. If `k` is 1, the function prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. If `k` is greater than 1, the function prints the string `s` twice unless `n` is 1, in which case it prints `s` once. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are no longer in use. **
