Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly initializes the dimensions of the field, the positions of the goals, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and the players.
   - It reads the initial state of the field and the sequence of actions.

2. **Handling Actions**:
   - The program correctly processes the actions for each step.
   - It updates the position of the Quaffle, the Bludger, and the players based on the actions.
   - It correctly handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.
   - It correctly checks if a player is eliminated by a Bludger and updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]`.

3. **Scoring**:
   - The program correctly increments the score for the appropriate team when a player scores in the other team's goal.
   - It correctly resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct events in the required format, including goals and eliminations.
   - It prints the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - It ensures that the Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field after each goal.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of players and prints the events in the correct order.

6. **Functionality**:
   - `func_1` correctly updates the position of the entity (Quaffle, Bludger, or player) based on the direction provided.
   - `func_2` correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the Bludger and prints the elimination events.

Given the above points, the program appears to meet the problem description and handle all the specified cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
