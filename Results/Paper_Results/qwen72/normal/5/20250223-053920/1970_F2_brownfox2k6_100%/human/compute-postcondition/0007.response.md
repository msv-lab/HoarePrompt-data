Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a non-negative integer `t` representing the current time step in the game. It identifies players in the `player` dictionary whose values match `blud` and updates their values to `[-1, -1]`. It then prints a message for each of these players, indicating the time step and that the player has been eliminated. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `player` dictionary will have the values of the identified players set to `[-1, -1]`, and the time step `t` remains unchanged. **
