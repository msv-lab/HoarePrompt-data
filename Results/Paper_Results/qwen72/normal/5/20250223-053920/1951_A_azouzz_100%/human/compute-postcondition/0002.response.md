Output State: **The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and `t` is decremented by the number of iterations that the loop has executed.** 

However, since `t` is the number of iterations specified in the loop's range, after the loop finishes executing, `t` will be 0. The values of `start` and `end` are not affected by the loop and remain the same as in the initial state. 

So, the final output state is:
- `start` remains the same.
- `end` remains the same.
- `t` is 0.

Output State: **`start` and `end` remain unchanged, `t` is 0.**
