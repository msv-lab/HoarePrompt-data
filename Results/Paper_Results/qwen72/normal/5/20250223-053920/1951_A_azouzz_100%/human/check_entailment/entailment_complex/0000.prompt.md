Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
import os def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end): # 获取当前目录下的所有子文件夹
current_dir = os.getcwd() subfolders = [f.path for f in
os.scandir(current_dir) if f.is_dir()] for folder in subfolders: #
检查文件夹名称是否在指定范围内 folder_name = os.path.basename(folder) if
folder_name.isdigit() and start <= int(folder_name) <= end: #
获取子文件夹中的所有.html文件 html_files = [f for f in os.listdir(folder) if
f.endswith('.html')] print(f"Folder '{folder}' contains {len(html_files)} HTML
files.") # 为每个.html文件生成对应的文件 for html_file in html_files: base_name =
os.path.splitext(html_file)[0] ac_file = os.path.join(folder,
f"{base_name}-ac.py") wa_file = os.path.join(folder, f"{base_name}-wa.py") #
创建文件 open(ac_file, 'w').close() open(wa_file, 'w').close() print(f"Generated
files: {ac_file}, {wa_file}") if __name__ == "__main__": # 指定目录范围 start_range
= 1951 end_range = 1980 generate_files_for_html_in_range(start_range,
end_range)

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers such that start <= end, and they represent the range of folder names to be considered, where folder names are numeric.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2:
            print('NO')
        elif cnt1 == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `start` and `end` remain unchanged, `t` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s` from the input. The function then checks the string `s` for the number of occurrences of the character '1'. If the count of '1' is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'. If the count is greater than 2 but odd, it prints 'NO'. If the count is exactly 1, it prints 'NO'. If the string contains the substring '11', it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `start` and `end` (if they exist) remain unchanged.
