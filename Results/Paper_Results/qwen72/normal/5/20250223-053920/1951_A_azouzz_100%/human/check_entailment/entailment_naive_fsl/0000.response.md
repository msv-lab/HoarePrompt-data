Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem description asks for a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that generates Python files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each HTML file in subfolders whose names are within a specified range. However, the program provided is a completely different function `func_1` that reads input and checks for certain conditions in a string, printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on those conditions. This program does not perform the task described in the problem statement, and therefore, it is incorrect.
