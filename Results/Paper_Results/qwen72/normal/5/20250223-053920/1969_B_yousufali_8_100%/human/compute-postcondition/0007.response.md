Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from user input, processes it to calculate a value `ans` based on the number of '1's and '0's in the string, and prints the final value of `ans`. Specifically, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that is preceded by at least one '1', where `n` is the count of '1's encountered before the '0'. The function does not return any value. **
