### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift of a substring is the length of the substring.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function reads a binary string `s` from input.
     - It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of '1's encountered so far.
     - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost.
     - It iterates through each character in `s`:
       - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
       - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases.
     - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Handling of Test Cases**:
     - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates the appropriate number of times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Calculation of Cost**:
     - `func_1` correctly calculates the cost to make the binary string sorted.
     - The logic of adding `n + 1` to `ans` for each '0' that is preceded by at least one '1' is correct because:
       - Each '0' that is preceded by '1's needs to be moved to the left of all '1's.
       - The cost of moving a '0' to the left of `n` '1's is `n + 1` (the length of the substring including the '0' and all preceding '1's).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **String with only '0's**:
     - The function correctly prints 0 because no operations are needed.
   - **String with only '1's**:
     - The function correctly prints 0 because no operations are needed.
   - **String with mixed '0's and '1's**:
     - The function correctly calculates the cost based on the number of '1's and '0's as described.

5. **Input and Output**:
   - The input and output format matches the problem description.
   - The function reads the input as specified and prints the output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
