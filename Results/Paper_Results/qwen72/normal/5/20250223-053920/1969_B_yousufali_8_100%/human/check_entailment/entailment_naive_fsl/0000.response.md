Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. For example, for the input `0000`, the program will still go through the loop and potentially add to `ans` even though the string is already sorted, which should result in a cost of `0`. The program does not correctly identify this and will output a non-zero value. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the string has no '1's, which should also result in a cost of `0`. For example, the input `0000` will result in an incorrect output.
