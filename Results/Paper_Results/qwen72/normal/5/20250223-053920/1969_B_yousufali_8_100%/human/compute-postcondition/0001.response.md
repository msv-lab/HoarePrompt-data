The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, which already ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, for the loop to start, `_` (which is a placeholder variable) does not need to be explicitly set, as it will be automatically assigned by the `range` function during the loop's execution.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, `_` is not set (but will be assigned by the loop)**

However, if we strictly adhere to the requirement that the state must ensure the loop executes, and since `t` is already within the required range, no further adjustment is necessary. Therefore, the state can be simplified to:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive**
