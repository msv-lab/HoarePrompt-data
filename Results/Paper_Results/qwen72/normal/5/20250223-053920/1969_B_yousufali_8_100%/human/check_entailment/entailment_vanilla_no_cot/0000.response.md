Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to handle a single test case, but it does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It counts the number of '1's in the string and adds `n + 1` to the answer every time it encounters a '0' after a '1'. This does not account for the optimal way to sort the string using cyclic shifts.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program will produce incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

- A binary string is sorted in non-descending order if all '0's come before all '1's.
- We can achieve this by finding the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts on substrings.
- The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `k` is `k`.

The correct approach involves:

1. Counting the number of '1's in the string.
2. Finding the minimum number of '1's that need to be moved to the end of the string to sort it.
3. The minimum cost is the length of the substring that needs to be cyclically shifted to achieve this.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones = s.count('1')
    min_cost = n
    current_cost = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            current_cost += 1
        if i >= ones and s[i - ones] == '1':
            current_cost -= 1
        min_cost = min(min_cost, current_cost)
    
    return min_cost + ones

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))

# Example usage
func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **`min_cost_to_sort(s)`**:
  - `ones` is the total number of '1's in the string.
  - We use a sliding window approach to find the minimum number of '1's that need to be moved to the end of the string.
  - `current_cost` keeps track of the number of '1's in the current window of size `ones`.
  - We slide the window from the start to the end of the string, updating `current_cost` and `min_cost` accordingly.
  - The final cost is `min_cost + ones` because we need to move `min_cost` '1's to the end, and the total cost is the length of the substring that needs to be shifted.

- **`func_2`**:
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, reads the binary string and prints the minimum cost to sort it using the `min_cost_to_sort` function.

This corrected program will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
