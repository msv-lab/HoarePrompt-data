### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** The function reads a binary string `s` from the input.
   - **Output:** The function prints the minimum total cost to make the string `s` sorted in non-descending order.
   - **Behavior:**
     - The function initializes `n` to 0, which counts the number of '1's encountered.
     - It also initializes `ans` to 0, which accumulates the total cost.
     - The function iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - **Behavior:**
     - The function iterates `t` times.
     - In each iteration, it calls `func_1` to handle one test case.
   - **Output:** The function does not return any value but prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Evaluating the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted or has no '1's.
   - **Case 1: String is already sorted (e.g., `0000`):**
     - In `func_1`, if the string is `0000`, the loop will not encounter any '1's, so `n` will remain 0.
     - The condition `if s[i] == '0' and n != 0` will never be true, so `ans` will remain 0.
     - Therefore, the function will correctly print `0` for the input `0000`.
   - **Case 2: String has no '1's (e.g., `0000`):**
     - This is the same as the previous case. The function will correctly print `0` for the input `0000`.

4. **Additional Considerations:**
   - **Case 3: String with '1's and '0's (e.g., `11000`):**
     - For `11000`, the function will:
       - Count 2 '1's (so `n` becomes 2).
       - Encounter the first '0' and add `2 + 1 = 3` to `ans`.
       - Encounter the second '0' and add `2 + 1 = 3` to `ans`.
       - Encounter the third '0' and add `2 + 1 = 3` to `ans`.
     - The total `ans` will be `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`, which is correct.
   - **Case 4: String with alternating '1's and '0's (e.g., `101011`):**
     - For `101011`, the function will:
       - Count 1 '1' (so `n` becomes 1).
       - Encounter the first '0' and add `1 + 1 = 2` to `ans`.
       - Count 1 more '1' (so `n` becomes 2).
       - Encounter the second '0' and add `2 + 1 = 3` to `ans`.
       - Count 1 more '1' (so `n` becomes 3).
       - The total `ans` will be `2 + 3 = 5`, which is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the cases where the string is already sorted or has no '1's.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program does not handle these cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
