### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of these shifts.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function reads a binary string `s` and initializes `n` to count the number of '1's and `ans` to store the total cost.
     - It iterates through each character of the string.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because each '0' that appears after a '1' requires a shift to move the '1's to the correct position.
     - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach in `func_1` is based on the observation that each '0' that appears after a '1' in the string requires a shift to move the '1's to the correct position. The cost of each shift is the length of the substring being shifted, which is `n + 1` where `n` is the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - This approach correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string by considering the positions of '0's and '1's and the necessary shifts.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Already Sorted String:** If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly outputs 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - **All '0's or All '1's:** If the string consists entirely of '0's or '1's, the function correctly outputs 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - **Mixed Strings:** For mixed strings, the function correctly calculates the cost by summing up the necessary shifts.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of `func_1` is O(|s|), where |s| is the length of the string.
   - The time complexity of `func_2` is O(t * |s|), where t is the number of test cases and |s| is the length of the string for each test case.
   - Given the constraints, this complexity is efficient and should handle the input within the given limits.

6. **Verification Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` correctly processes the binary string and calculates the total cost.
   - The state of the program before and after the function calls is as expected.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and efficiently calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.

Final: **True**
