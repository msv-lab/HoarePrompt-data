Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of positive integers and a series of queries `q`. The array `c` has a length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). The number of queries `q` is also a positive integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is a list of prefix sums of the original `a`, `c` is unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`. The loop prints 'NO' for each query `(x, y)` where `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, and 'YES' otherwise.
