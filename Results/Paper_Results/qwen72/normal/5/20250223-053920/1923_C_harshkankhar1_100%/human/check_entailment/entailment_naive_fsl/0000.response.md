Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray is good but the sum of the elements in the subarray is equal to the sum of the elements in the constructed array `b`. Specifically, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for such cases. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```
The program will output:
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```
However, for the query (1, 3), the subarray is `1 2 1`. The sum of this subarray is 4. A possible array `b` that satisfies the conditions is `2 1 1`, which also sums to 4. Therefore, the subarray `1 2 1` is good, but the program incorrectly prints "NO" for this query.
