You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of positive integers and a series of queries `q`. The array `c` has a length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). The number of queries `q` is also a positive integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is a list of prefix sums of the original `a`, `c` is unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`. The loop prints 'NO' for each query `(x, y)` where `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, and 'YES' otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an array `c` of positive integers and a series of queries `q`. The array `c` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and each element `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). The number of queries `q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5). Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The function processes each query and returns the result for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
