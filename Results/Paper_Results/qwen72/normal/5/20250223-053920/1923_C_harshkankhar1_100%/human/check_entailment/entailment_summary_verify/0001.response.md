### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray of `c` is "good."
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another subarray `b` of the same length such that:
     - The sum of elements in the subarray of `c` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray of `b`.
     - No element in the subarray of `c` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray of `b`.
     - All elements in the subarray of `b` are positive.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `c` and processes `q` queries.

3. **Array `b` Construction:**
   - The array `b` is constructed such that each element `b[i]` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not.
   - This ensures that `b[i]` is always positive and different from `a[i]`.

4. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of subarrays.
   - `a` is the prefix sum array of the original array `c`.
   - `b` is the prefix sum array of the constructed array `b`.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is greater than or equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray `b[l_i, r_i]`.
   - If the sum of `c[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of `b[l_i, r_i]`, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to construct a subarray `b` that meets all the conditions.
   - If `l_i == r_i`, it prints "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot be "good" (since `b[i]` must be different from `c[i]` and positive).
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

6. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the array `a` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It constructs the array `b` such that each element `b[i]` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not.
   - It then calculates the prefix sums for `a` and `b`.
   - For each query, it checks the conditions and prints the appropriate result.

7. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly constructs the array `b` to ensure that each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in `a`.
   - The use of prefix sums allows for efficient calculation of subarray sums.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `l_i == r_i` by printing "NO".
   - The program correctly prints "NO" if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray `b[l_i, r_i]`.

8. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function summary states that `b[i]` is constructed based on the prefix sum of `a` after the prefix sum is calculated. However, the actual code constructs `b` based on the original array `a` before the prefix sum is calculated. This is a minor discrepancy but does not affect the correctness of the program.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly checks the conditions for each subarray and handles edge cases appropriately. The minor discrepancy in the function summary does not impact the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
