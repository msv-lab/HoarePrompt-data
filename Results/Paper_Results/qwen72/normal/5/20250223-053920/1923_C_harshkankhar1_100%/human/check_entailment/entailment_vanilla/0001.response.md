### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good."
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another subarray `b` of the same length such that:
     - The sum of elements in the subarray of `c` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray of `b`.
     - No element in the subarray of `c` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray of `b`.
     - All elements in the subarray of `b` are positive.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `c` and processes `q` queries.

3. **Array `b` Construction:**
   - The array `b` is constructed such that each element `b[i]` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not.
   - This ensures that `b[i]` is always positive and different from `a[i]`.

4. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of subarrays.
   - `a` is the prefix sum array of the original array `c`.
   - `b` is the prefix sum array of the constructed array `b`.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is greater than or equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray `b[l_i, r_i]`.
   - If the sum of `c[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of `b[l_i, r_i]`, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to construct a subarray `b` that meets all the conditions.
   - If `l_i == r_i`, it prints "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot be "good" (since `b[i]` must be different from `c[i]` and positive).
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `l_i == r_i` by printing "NO".
   - It also correctly handles the case where the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray `b[l_i, r_i]`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and constraints. It efficiently checks the conditions for each subarray and handles edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
