### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the array `a` and initializes an array `b` of the same length as `a` with an extra element at the beginning (to handle 1-based indexing).

2. **Array `b` Construction:**
   - The array `b` is constructed such that for each element `a[i]`:
     - If `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 1`.
     - If `a[i] <= 1`, then `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 2`.
   - This construction ensures that `b[i]` is always greater than `a[i]` and that `b[i] > 0` for all `i`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The array `a` is converted into a prefix sum array using `accumulate`.
   - This allows for efficient computation of the sum of any subarray `a[x]` to `a[y]` using `a[y] - a[x - 1]`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(x, y)`, the program checks two conditions:
     - `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]`: This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `a[x]` to `a[y]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. If this is true, it means that the subarray `a[x]` to `a[y]` cannot be transformed into a good subarray `b` because the sum of `b` would be greater.
     - `x == y`: This condition checks if the subarray is a single element. A single element subarray cannot be good because there is no way to transform it into a different array `b` that satisfies all the conditions.

5. **Output:**
   - If either of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The construction of `b` ensures that it is always possible to find a corresponding `b_i` for each `a_i` such that `a_i != b_i` and `b_i > 0`.
- The use of prefix sums allows for efficient query processing.
- The conditions checked in the query processing are correct and ensure that the subarray is good or not.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
