#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of positive integers and a series of queries `q`. The array `c` has a length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). The number of queries `q` is also a positive integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` and `q` are unchanged, `a` is a list of prefix sums of the original `a`, `c` is unchanged, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`. The loop prints 'NO' for each query `(x, y)` where `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, and 'YES' otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an array `a` of positive integers and a series of queries `q`. It processes each query, which is defined by two integers `x` and `y` representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `a`. For each query, the function prints 'NO' if the sum of the subarray `a[x:y]` is less than the corresponding sum of the subarray `b[x:y]` or if `x` is equal to `y`. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not modify the input array `a` or the number of queries `q`. After the function concludes, `a` is a list of prefix sums of the original array, and `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.
