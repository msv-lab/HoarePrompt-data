Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an array `c` of positive integers and a series of queries `q`. The array `c` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and each element `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). The number of queries `q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5). Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The function processes each query and returns the result for each query.**
