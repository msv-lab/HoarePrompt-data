### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - The integers are split and stored in a list `list1`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list `list1` of integers. Sorting is essential to ensure that we can always pick the smallest possible values for the minimum operation.

3. **Selecting Pairs**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list and selects every second element starting from the first element. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will always be at the beginning, and by selecting every second element, we ensure that we are picking the smaller of each pair of elements.
   - The selected elements are stored in `list2`.

4. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the elements in `list2`, which represents the maximum score achievable by always picking the smaller element from each pair.
   - This sum is appended to the `out` list.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results stored in `out`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - The program also handles cases where all elements are the same correctly.
   - The program ensures that the list `list1` and `list2` are cleared after each test case to avoid interference between test cases.

### Correctness:
The program follows the correct logic to solve the problem. It sorts the list of integers, selects the smaller elements from each pair, and sums them to get the maximum score. The input and output handling is also correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
