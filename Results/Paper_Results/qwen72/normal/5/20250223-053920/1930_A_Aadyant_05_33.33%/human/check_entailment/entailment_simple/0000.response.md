### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the number of pairs) and then reads a line of `2n` integers.
   - The integers are split into a list `list1` and sorted.

2. **Logic for Maximum Score**:
   - The goal is to maximize the score by adding the minimum of each pair of integers.
   - By sorting the list, the smallest elements are at the beginning. The optimal strategy is to pair the smallest elements together, as this ensures that the minimum values are added to the score.
   - The function iterates through the sorted list and appends every second element (starting from the first) to `list2`. This is because the sorted list ensures that the first element of each pair is the minimum value of that pair.
   - The sum of `list2` is then appended to the output list `out`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of `out`, which contains the maximum scores for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the constraints correctly: `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`, and `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`.
   - The function correctly processes the input and produces the expected output for the given example.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score for the given problem. It reads the input, processes each test case by sorting the list and selecting the minimum values, and then prints the results. The approach is optimal and the code handles the constraints and edge cases as described.

**Correctness: True**
