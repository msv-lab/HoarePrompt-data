Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user, where each set includes an integer `slength` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `slength`. For each set, it checks if the string `c` is different from both `a` and `b`, and if each character in `c` is either present in the corresponding position in `a` or `b`. If `c` meets these conditions, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. The loop runs `tests` times, where `tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000. **
