The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range` function, and the `range` function depends on the input provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer greater than 0. The variables `t` and `s` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, the input must be a positive integer greater than 0**
