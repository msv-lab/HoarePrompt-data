The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers from the input. It then checks if there exists an index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and moves to the next test case. If no such index is found, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, and the input list `l` remain unchanged after the function execution.
