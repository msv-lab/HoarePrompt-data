Output State: **The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it checks the list `l` of length `n`. If it finds an index `i` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it prints `3`. The variables `i` and `j` are reset to `0` at the beginning of each iteration.**
