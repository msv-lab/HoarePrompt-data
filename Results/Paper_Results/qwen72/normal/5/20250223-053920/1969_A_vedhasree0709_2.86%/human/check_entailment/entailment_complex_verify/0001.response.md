### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The best friend of the i-th friend is given by `p_i`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution iterates through the list `l` which represents the best friends of each friend.
   - It checks if `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` for any `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - If this condition is met, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1` to indicate that a valid pair has been found.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Identifying Flaws:**
   - The condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is very specific and only checks for a particular pattern where the best friends are consecutive in the list.
   - This condition does not account for all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can come to the party with the minimum number of invitations.
   - For example, if the best friends form a cycle of length 2 (like `[2, 1]`), the solution should print `2` but it might not if the cycle is not at the end of the list.
   - The solution also does not handle cases where the best friends form a cycle of length greater than 2 or where there are multiple cycles.
   - The solution incorrectly assumes that if no such consecutive pair is found, the minimum number of invitations required is always 3, which is not necessarily true.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships.
   - If there is a cycle of length 2, we can invite both friends in the cycle to ensure they both come.
   - If there is a cycle of length greater than 2, we need to invite at least one friend from each cycle to ensure at least 2 friends come.
   - If there are no cycles of length 2, we need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come, as inviting 2 friends might not guarantee that both will come.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks for a specific pattern and does not handle all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can come to the party with the minimum number of invitations. The solution fails to identify cycles and handle them appropriately.

### Correctness:
**False**
