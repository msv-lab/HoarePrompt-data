The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `cases` contains `t` inner lists, where each inner list consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The exact nature of the returned results is not specified, but they are derived from the input integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. It returns a list of results, where each result is based on the integers provided in the corresponding inner list of `cases`.**
