The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. The state of `a` and `b` does not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers where 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
