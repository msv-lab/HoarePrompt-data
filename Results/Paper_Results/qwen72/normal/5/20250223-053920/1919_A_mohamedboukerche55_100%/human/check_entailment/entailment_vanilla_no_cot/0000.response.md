Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd and decides the winner based on that. However, this is not the correct approach to determine the winner of the game.

The correct approach involves understanding the game dynamics:
- If both players have the same number of coins, Bob will always win because Alice will be the first to run out of coins after an even number of moves.
- If the number of coins is different, the player with more coins can always force a win by ensuring they are the one to make the last move.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This version correctly determines the winner based on the number of coins each player has. If Alice and Bob have the same number of coins, Bob wins. Otherwise, Alice wins.
