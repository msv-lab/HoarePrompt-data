You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two integers a and b as input, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input during the `t` iterations. The loop will print 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their current wallet.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet before removing a coin.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses the game.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is symmetric in the sense that the total number of coins (a + b) remains constant.
   - The player who starts with an even total number of coins (a + b) will always lose if both players play optimally.
   - The player who starts with an odd total number of coins (a + b) will always win if both players play optimally.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the first player (Alice) will always be forced to make the last move that results in an empty wallet, thus losing the game.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player (Bob) into a position where Bob will be forced to make the last move that results in an empty wallet, thus winning the game.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the key insight.
   - It handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
   - The input and output format matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the provided problem description and the optimal strategy for the game.

### Correctness:
**True**
