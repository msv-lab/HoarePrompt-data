The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a string `s` from the input, splits the string into two integers `a` and `b`, and checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input during the `t` iterations.
