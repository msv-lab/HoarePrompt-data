Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all potential cases. The logic in the program is based on the sum of the coins in both wallets being even or odd, which is not a correct approach to solving the problem.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
Alice
```

Actual Output from the program:
```
Bob
```

In this case, Alice can win by following these steps:
1. Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob. Now, a=2 and b=1.
2. Bob chooses to not swap wallets. Now, a=1 and b=1.
3. Alice chooses to not swap wallets. Now, a=0 and b=1.
4. Bob is forced to not swap wallets. Now, a=0 and b=0.
5. Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

The program incorrectly outputs "Bob" because it relies on the sum of the coins being even or odd, rather than the optimal strategy for the game. The correct approach would involve considering the parity of the number of coins in each wallet and the optimal moves that can be made.
