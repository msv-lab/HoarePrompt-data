### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, extracting the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b`.
   - This approach is efficient and correctly handles the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program extracts the encoded string `b`.
   - It creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - The creation of the `char_map` dictionary is done by mapping each character in `r` to its symmetric character. This is achieved by iterating over the sorted unique characters and mapping the i-th character to the (len_unique - 1 - i)-th character.
   - The decoding process involves replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are stored in a list `results` and printed one by one after all test cases are processed.
   - This ensures that the output format matches the problem requirements.

### Validation of Annotated Code:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
  - This is accurate and matches the problem description.

- **State within the function:**
  - `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.
  - `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from `encoded` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of the `unique_chars` list, in reverse order.
  - `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.
  - These states are correctly described and match the program's behavior.

- **State at the end of the function:**
  - `decoded` is a string where each character from `encoded` has been replaced by the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order, as mapped by `char_map`.
  - The `unique_chars` list and `len_unique` remain unchanged.
  - This is also accurate and matches the program's behavior.

### Edge Cases and Performance:

- **Single-Character Strings:**
  - The program handles single-character strings correctly. For example, if the encoded string is "w", the unique characters list will be ["w"], and the mapping will be `{'w': 'w'}`, resulting in the correct decoded string "w".

- **Strings with Repeated Characters:**
  - The program correctly handles strings with repeated characters by ensuring that the mapping is consistent. For example, if the encoded string is "ttf", the unique characters list will be ["f", "t"], and the mapping will be `{'f': 't', 't': 'f'}`, resulting in the correct decoded string "fft".

- **Performance:**
  - The program efficiently processes the input and performs the decoding in linear time relative to the length of the string, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and correctness.

Final: **True**
