Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and the length `n` and encoded string `b` for each test case.
   - The index `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the `data` list, ensuring that the correct values are read for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Unique Characters and Sorting**:
     - `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))` correctly identifies all distinct characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them in alphabetical order.
     - This step is crucial because it constructs the auxiliary string `r` as described in the problem statement.
   - **Character Mapping**:
     - `char_map = {}` initializes an empty dictionary to store the character mappings.
     - The loop `for i in range(len_unique):` iterates over the indices of the `unique_chars` list.
     - `char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]` correctly maps each character to its symmetric character in the `unique_chars` list.
     - For example, if `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, the mapping will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
   - **Decoding**:
     - `decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)` replaces each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.
     - This step ensures that the original string `s` is reconstructed correctly.
   - **Return Value**:
     - The function returns the `decoded` string, which is the original string `s` before encoding.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line, which matches the expected output format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles single-character strings correctly (e.g., `b = 'w'` results in `s = 'w'`).
   - It also handles strings with repeated characters correctly (e.g., `b = 'ttf'` results in `s = 'fft'`).

5. **Performance**:
   - The program efficiently processes the input and constructs the mappings, ensuring that it can handle the maximum constraints (up to `10^4` test cases and strings of length up to `2 \cdot 10^5`).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement and handles all specified edge cases and constraints.

Final: **True**
