Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself. This part of the program correctly handles the input format as specified.

2. **Unique Characters and Mapping**: The function `func_1` correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string `encoded` and sorts them in alphabetical order. It then creates a mapping where each character is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters. This is done by iterating over the unique characters and mapping the `i`-th character to the `(len_unique - 1 - i)`-th character.

3. **Decoding Process**: The function constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with the corresponding character from the `char_map`. This process is correct because it follows the reverse mapping as described in the problem statement.

4. **Output**: The program collects the results of decoding for each test case and prints them one by one. This matches the expected output format.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with repeated characters correctly. For example, for the input "w", the unique characters list is ["w"], and the mapping is `{'w': 'w'}`, which correctly decodes to "w".

6. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it processes each test case in linear time relative to the length of the encoded string.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
