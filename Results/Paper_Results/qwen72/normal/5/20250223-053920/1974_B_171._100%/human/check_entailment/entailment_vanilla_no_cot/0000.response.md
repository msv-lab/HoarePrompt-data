Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly decodes the encoded string based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the input in a loop, reading the number of test cases and the details of each test case.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It constructs a sorted set of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted set is mapped to its symmetric character in the set.
   - **Decoding**: It decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the decoded string for each test case.

The logic follows the problem description accurately, and the implementation is correct. Therefore, the program is correct.
