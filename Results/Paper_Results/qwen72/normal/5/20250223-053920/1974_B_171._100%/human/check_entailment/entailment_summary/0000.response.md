Reasoning:  
The provided program follows the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (length `n` and encoded string `b`).

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - It then constructs a mapping `char_map` where each character in the sorted unique list is mapped to its symmetric character from the end of the list.
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of decoding for each test case and prints them one by one.

The program correctly handles the input and output format, and the decoding logic matches the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly decodes the string by reversing the encoding process described.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` behaves as expected, and the program produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
