Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the input to handle multiple test cases. This approach is efficient and correctly handles the input format as specified.

2. **Test Case Loop**: The program correctly iterates over the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string and the encoded string `b` itself. This is in line with the problem description.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Unique Characters**: The program constructs a list `unique_chars` of all distinct characters in the encoded string `b`, sorted in alphabetical order. This matches the first step of the encoding algorithm where the auxiliary string `r` is created.
   - **Character Mapping**: The program creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric character in the list. For example, the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on. This correctly implements the second step of the encoding algorithm.
   - **Decoding**: The program then constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`. This is the reverse of the encoding process and should correctly restore the original string.

4. **Output**: The program prints the decoded string for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character String**: If the encoded string `b` consists of a single character, the program will correctly map it to itself since the `unique_chars` list will have only one character.
   - **All Characters Unique**: If all characters in `b` are unique, the program will correctly map each character to its symmetric counterpart.
   - **All Characters Same**: If all characters in `b` are the same, the program will correctly map each character to itself, as the `unique_chars` list will have only one character.

6. **Efficiency**: The program efficiently handles the constraints (1 \le t \le 10^4 and 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5) by processing all input at once and using a dictionary for character mapping, which ensures O(1) lookups.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It handles all specified input and output formats and edge cases without issues.

Final: **True**
