Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading a binary string `s` and printing the result of `func_1(s)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - **Loop through the string**: It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
     - If the character is '0' and there are some '1's before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This is because to move a '0' past all the '1's before it, you need to perform a cyclic shift of a substring of length `one + 1`.

3. **Output**: The function returns the total `cost` for sorting the binary string.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by considering the number of '1's before each '0' and performing the necessary cyclic shifts.
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases correctly:
     - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000"), the cost is 0.
     - If the string has a mix of '0's and '1's, the cost is calculated based on the positions of '0's and the number of '1's before them.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
