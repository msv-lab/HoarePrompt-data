The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a binary string consisting of only 0s and 1s, with a length between 2 and 200,000. The function returns the total number of '0's in `s` that come after at least one '1', where each '0' contributes a cost equal to the number of '1's seen so far plus one.
