### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string and maintains two variables: `cost` and `one`.
   - `one` counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - When a '0' is encountered and there are '1's before it (`one > 0`), the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic is based on the idea that each time a '0' appears after a '1', it needs to be moved to the left of all the '1's encountered so far.
   - The cost of moving a '0' to the left of `one` '1's is `one + 1` because it involves a cyclic shift of a substring of length `one + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - For strings like "101011", the function correctly computes the cost as 5 by moving each '0' to the left of the '1's.
   - For strings like "01101001", the function correctly computes the cost as 11 by moving each '0' to the left of the '1's.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The function `func_1` has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.
   - The overall program handles multiple test cases and processes each string in linear time, which is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For "10", the function correctly returns 2.
   - For "0000", the function correctly returns 0.
   - For "11000", the function correctly returns 9.
   - For "101011", the function correctly returns 5.
   - For "01101001", the function correctly returns 11.

### Systematic Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - `s` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000.
  - `t` is the number of test cases, ranging from 1 to 10,000.

- **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
  - **State Before Function Call:**
    - `s` is a binary string.
  - **State Inside Function:**
    - `cost` is initialized to 0.
    - `one` is initialized to 0.
    - The loop iterates through each character in `s`.
      - If the character is '1', `one` is incremented.
      - If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, `cost` is incremented by `one + 1`.
  - **State After Function Call:**
    - `s` remains unchanged.
    - `cost` is the total number of '0's in `s` that come after at least one '1', each contributing a cost of the number of '1's seen so far plus one.
    - `one` is the total number of '1's in `s`.

- **Final State:**
  - The function returns the total cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts of substrings. The solution is efficient and handles all edge cases as described. The annotations confirm that the state of the program and the variables are correctly managed and that the final cost is computed accurately.

Final: **True**
