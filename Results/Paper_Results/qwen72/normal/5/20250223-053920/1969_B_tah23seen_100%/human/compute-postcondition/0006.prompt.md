You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only 0s and 1s) with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: `s` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000, `cost` is the total number of '0's in `s` that come after at least one '1', each contributing a cost of the number of '1's seen so far plus one, and `one` is the total number of '1's in `s`.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of '0's in `s` that come after at least one '1', each contributing a cost of the number of '1's seen so far plus one.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a binary string `s` and returns the total cost of '0's in `s` that come after at least one '1', where each '0' contributes a cost equal to the number of '1's seen so far plus one.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of '0's in `s` that come after at least one '1', each contributing a cost of the number of '1's seen so far plus one.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
