### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, reading a binary string `s` for each test case and printing the result of `func_1(s)`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order.
   - It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.
   - The logic behind this is that each '0' that appears after a '1' in the string contributes to the cost. The cost is the number of '1's seen so far plus one, which corresponds to the length of the substring that needs to be cyclically shifted to move the '0' to the correct position.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation is based on the observation that to sort the string, we need to move all '0's that appear after '1's to the front of the string.
   - Each '0' that appears after a '1' will require a cyclic shift of a substring of length `one + 1` (where `one` is the number of '1's seen so far).
   - This is because the substring from the first '1' to the current '0' needs to be shifted to move the '0' to the front.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the cost will be 0, which is correct.
   - If the string has a mix of '0's and '1's but is not sorted, the cost will be calculated correctly based on the number of '0's that need to be moved.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input "10", the cost is 2 because the entire string needs to be shifted.
   - For the input "0000", the cost is 0 because the string is already sorted.
   - For the input "11000", the cost is 9 because the optimal strategy involves shifting substrings of lengths 3, 3, and 3.
   - For the input "101011", the cost is 5 because the optimal strategy involves shifting substrings of lengths 2 and 3.
   - For the input "01101001", the cost is 11 because the optimal strategy involves shifting substrings of lengths 2, 3, and 6.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The cost calculation is accurate and the program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
