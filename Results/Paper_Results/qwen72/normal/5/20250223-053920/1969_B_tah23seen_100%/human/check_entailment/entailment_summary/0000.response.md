Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The approach taken by the function `func_1` is to calculate the cost based on the number of '0's that appear after any '1's in the string. This is because to sort the string, any '0' that appears after a '1' must be moved to the left of all '1's, and the cost of each such move is the length of the substring being shifted, which includes the '0' and all preceding '1's.

However, the approach in `func_1` has a flaw. It calculates the cost as the number of '1's seen before each '0' plus one, but this does not necessarily reflect the minimum cost to sort the string. The correct approach should consider the minimum number of shifts required to move all '0's to the left of all '1's, which can be more efficiently calculated by finding the longest contiguous segment of '1's and subtracting its length from the total length of the string, then adding 1.

Let's break down why the current implementation is incorrect:
1. **Cost Calculation**: The current implementation adds `one + 1` to the cost for each '0' that appears after a '1'. This is not the correct way to calculate the minimum cost. The correct cost should be based on the length of the substring that needs to be shifted to move the '0' to the correct position.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy is to find the longest segment of '1's and shift the rest of the string to the left. The cost is the length of the string minus the length of the longest segment of '1's plus 1.

Given these points, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all cases. For example, for the string "101011", the correct minimum cost is 5, but the current implementation might not always produce this result.

Correctness: **False**
