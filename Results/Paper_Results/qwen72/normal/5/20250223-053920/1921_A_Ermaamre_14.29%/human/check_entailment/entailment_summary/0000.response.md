### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`.

2. **Square Validation**:
   - The program assumes that the input coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. This is a reasonable assumption given the problem constraints.
   - The program checks if the x-coordinates of opposite corners are equal and then calculates the side length of the square based on the y-coordinates.

3. **Side Length Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the side length of the square by taking the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the opposite corners.
   - It then prints the area of the square by squaring the side length.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the cases where the x-coordinates of opposite corners are equal, which is a valid scenario for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - However, the program does not explicitly handle or report invalid input, but the problem guarantees that the input will form a valid square.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the area of the square for each test case, which is the required output.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly calculates the area of the square for the given test cases.
- The logic is sound and aligns with the problem description.
- The program does not handle invalid input, but the problem guarantees that the input will be valid.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summary. It correctly calculates the area of the square for valid inputs.
