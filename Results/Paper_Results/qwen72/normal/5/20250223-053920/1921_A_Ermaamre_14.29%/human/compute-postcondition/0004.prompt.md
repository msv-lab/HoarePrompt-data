You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input in the form of multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        
        print(res ** 2)
        
    #State: The loop will print the square of the side length of the square for each test case. The variables `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4` will have their final values as the coordinates of the last test case, and `res` will be the side length of the last square. The variable `a` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns the area of the square for each valid test case. If a test case does not represent a valid square, it returns an error message indicating invalid input.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
