### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`.

2. **Coordinate Checking:**
   - The program checks if the coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It does this by comparing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points.
   - The conditions `if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`, `if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`, and `if x1 == x4 and x3 == x2` are used to identify pairs of points that share the same x-coordinates, which should be the vertical sides of the square.

3. **Side Length Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the side length of the square by taking the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the points that share the same x-coordinates.
   - The side length is then squared to get the area of the square.

4. **Output:**
   - The area of the square is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- The program only checks for specific pairs of coordinates to determine the side length. However, the problem states that the coordinates are given in random order, so the program might not correctly identify the side length in all cases.
- The program assumes that the first two pairs of coordinates will always form the sides of the square, which is not guaranteed. The coordinates could be in any order, and the program should be able to handle all possible permutations of the coordinates.

### Correct Approach:
- To correctly determine the side length of the square, the program should:
  - Identify the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
  - The side length of the square is the absolute difference between the two unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the square is symmetric).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = []
        for j in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set([point[0] for point in points]))
        y_coords = sorted(set([point[1] for point in points]))
        
        # Calculate the side length
        side_length = abs(x_coords[1] - x_coords[0])
        
        # Print the area
        print(side_length ** 2)
```

### Explanation:
- **Extract Unique Coordinates:**
  - The program collects all four points and then extracts the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
  - Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, there will be exactly two unique x-coordinates and two unique y-coordinates.
- **Calculate Side Length:**
  - The side length is calculated as the absolute difference between the two unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).
- **Print Area:**
  - The area of the square is the side length squared, which is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not handle the coordinates in random order correctly. The corrected program ensures that the coordinates are processed in a way that correctly identifies the side length of the square.

Correctness: **False**
