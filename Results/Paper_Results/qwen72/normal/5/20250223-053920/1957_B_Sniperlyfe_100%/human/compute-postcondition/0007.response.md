The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), and each subsequent element is the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1}\) and the remaining value of `k` at the start of each iteration, until `k` becomes 0.
