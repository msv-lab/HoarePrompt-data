Reasoning: The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of making the array non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (swapping a prefix and a suffix). Therefore, it fails to handle cases where the array can be sorted by such operations but is not initially sorted.

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`. This array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix `[3]` and the suffix `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`. However, `func_1` will return "No" for this array because it is not already non-decreasing.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should check if there exists a valid split point such that the concatenated suffix and prefix form a non-decreasing array. This involves more complex logic than simply checking if the array is already sorted.

Final: **False**
