Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns "Yes". If it is not, it returns "No".
   - However, the problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the array) any number of times, not just checking if it is already sorted.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case, which, as explained above, does not perform the required check.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, you need to check if there exists a way to split the array into two parts such that when these parts are swapped, the resulting array is non-decreasing. This can be done by finding the point where the array breaks the non-decreasing order and then checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix and suffix at that point.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_become_non_decreasing(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the first position where the array breaks the non-decreasing order
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            # Check if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix and suffix at this point
            prefix = arr[:i + 1]
            suffix = arr[i + 1:]
            new_arr = suffix + prefix
            if all(new_arr[j] <= new_arr[j + 1] for j in range(n - 1)):
                return 'Yes'
            # Check if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix and suffix at the next point
            if i + 1 < n - 1 and arr[i] <= arr[i + 2]:
                prefix = arr[:i + 2]
                suffix = arr[i + 2:]
                new_arr = suffix + prefix
                if all(new_arr[j] <= new_arr[j + 1] for j in range(n - 1)):
                    return 'Yes'
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = can_become_non_decreasing(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Approach:

1. **`can_become_non_decreasing` Function**:
   - It iterates through the array to find the first position where the array breaks the non-decreasing order.
   - It then checks if swapping the prefix and suffix at that position results in a non-decreasing array.
   - If not, it checks if swapping the prefix and suffix at the next position (if possible) results in a non-decreasing array.
   - If neither of these checks passes, it returns "No". If the array is already non-decreasing, it returns "Yes".

2. **`func_2` Function**:
   - It reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls the corrected `can_become_non_decreasing` function for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

This corrected approach ensures that the program correctly determines whether the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation.
