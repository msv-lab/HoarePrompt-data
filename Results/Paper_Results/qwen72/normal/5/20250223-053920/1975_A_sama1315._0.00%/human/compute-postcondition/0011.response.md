Functionality: ** The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of integers, and applies a function `func_1` to each set. It then prints the results of these function applications, each on a new line. The function does not return any value. The input is expected to be formatted such that the first integer `t` indicates the number of test cases, each test case starts with an integer `n` indicating the number of integers in the following list `arr`. After the function concludes, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 for each test case, `arr` is a list of `n` integers for each test case, and `index` is equal to the length of the input data. The `results` list contains `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers. **
