Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the problem description requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix) any number of times, not just if it is already sorted.
   - The function `func_1` does not implement the logic to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by the specified operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
   - The input is correctly parsed and the results are stored in the `results` list.
   - The results are then printed, each on a new line.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output format as described in the problem.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The main issue is with `func_1`. The function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the logic to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by the specified operation.
   - The problem requires a more complex logic to determine if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing, which is not present in `func_1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
