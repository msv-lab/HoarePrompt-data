Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem of determining whether the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping a prefix and a suffix. It only checks if the array is already non-decreasing, which is not sufficient. For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`. This array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix `[3]` and the suffix `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`. However, `func_1` will return "No" for this array because it is not already non-decreasing. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
