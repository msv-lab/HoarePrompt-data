Reasoning:
The provided program is supposed to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits and inserting them back into the array in the same position. However, the program's logic does not correctly implement this operation.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the array for each test case.
2. **Sorting Check**: The program attempts to check if the array can be sorted by iterating from the end of the array to the beginning. If it finds an element that is smaller than the previous element, it splits the previous element into its digits and appends the current element to this list of digits.
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The program checks if the list of digits (including the current element) is sorted. However, this check is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted by the described operation. The program should instead simulate the operation of splitting elements and then check if the resulting array is sorted.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - The program correctly identifies that the array can be sorted by splitting the first element into `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted.
- **Test Case 2**: `[12, 28, 5]`
  - The program incorrectly identifies that the array cannot be sorted. The correct approach would be to split `28` into `[2, 8]`, resulting in `[12, 2, 8, 5]`, and then split `12` into `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which can be further sorted to `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`.
- **Test Case 3**: `[0, 0]`
  - The program correctly identifies that the array is already sorted.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Iterate through the array and split any element that is at least 10 into its digits.
2. Insert the digits back into the array in the same position.
3. Check if the resulting array is sorted.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the described operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
