You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input (stdin) and output through standard output (stdout). The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The loop will execute for each test case, and for each test case, it will read an integer `m` and an array `arr` of length `m`. It will then determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly moving the last element to the front if it is smaller than the element before it. If the array can be sorted this way, it will print 'YES'; otherwise, it will print 'NO'. After all test cases are processed, the variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` will no longer be in the same state as the initial state, but the overall function will have completed its execution and printed the results for all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers. It processes each test case and outputs the results to standard output.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
