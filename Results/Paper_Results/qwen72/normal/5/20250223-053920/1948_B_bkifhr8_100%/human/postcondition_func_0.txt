The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if the array can be sorted by repeatedly moving the last element to the front if it is smaller than the element before it. If the array can be sorted this way, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution and the results for all test cases are printed to standard output.
