Output State: **The loop will execute for each test case, and for each test case, it will read an integer `m` and an array `arr` of length `m`. It will then determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly moving the last element to the front if it is smaller than the element before it. If the array can be sorted this way, it will print 'YES'; otherwise, it will print 'NO'. After all test cases are processed, the variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` will no longer be in the same state as the initial state, but the overall function will have completed its execution and printed the results for all test cases.**
