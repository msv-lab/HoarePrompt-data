Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits and inserting those digits back into the array in the same position.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Loop for Test Cases**:
   - The function `func` reads `n` as the number of test cases, but it should read `t` instead. This is a typo that would cause the program to read the wrong number of test cases.
   
2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Checking**:
   - The program checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and if so, it splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem.
   - The operation should split `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and replace `arr[i - 1]` with those digits, not append `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - The program also does not correctly handle the insertion of the digits back into the array in the same position. It simply replaces `arr[i - 1]` with the first digit of the split number, which is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Condition for Sorting**:
   - The program checks if the list of digits `nums` is sorted, but this is not the correct condition. The correct condition should be to check if the array can be sorted after performing the operation on the elements that are at least 10.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, you should:
  1. Read the array.
  2. Check if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their digits and inserting those digits back into the array in the same position.
  3. If at any point the array cannot be sorted by this operation, print 'NO'.
  4. If the array can be sorted, print 'YES'.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Correct the variable name from `n` to `t`
    for _ in range(t):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1):
            while arr[i] >= 10:  # Split the element if it is at least 10
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
                arr[i:i+1] = digits  # Replace the element with its digits
                
            if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
                ans = False
                break
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
- **Splitting Elements**: For each element in the array, if it is at least 10, it is split into its digits and those digits are inserted back into the array in place of the original element.
- **Checking Sorted Order**: After splitting, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. If at any point an element is greater than the next element, the array cannot be sorted, and the program sets `ans` to `False`.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned. The corrected program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
