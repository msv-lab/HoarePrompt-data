You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input (stdin) and output through standard output (stdout). The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: The loop will execute for each test case, and for each test case, it will read an integer `m` and an array `arr` of length `m`. It will then determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly moving the last element to the front if it is smaller than the element before it. If the array can be sorted this way, it will print 'YES'; otherwise, it will print 'NO'. After all test cases are processed, the variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` will no longer be in the same state as the initial state, but the overall function will have completed its execution and printed the results for all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if the array can be sorted by repeatedly moving the last element to the front if it is smaller than the element before it. If the array can be sorted this way, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution and the results for all test cases are printed to standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption**:
   - The program starts with the assumption that the array can be sorted (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Traversal**:
   - The program traverses the array from the second last element to the first element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - This is a good approach because if an element is out of order, we need to check if it can be split to make the array sorted.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]` (`if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`).
   - If this condition is met, it means the array is not sorted at this position.

5. **Split and Sort Check**:
   - The program splits the previous element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends the current element `arr[i]` to the list of digits (`nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]`).
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted (`if nums != sorted(nums)`).
   - If the list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Update Array**:
   - If the list of digits is sorted, the program updates the previous element to the first digit of the list (`arr[i - 1] = nums[0]`).

7. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements for a test case, the program prints `YES` if `ans` is `True`, otherwise `NO`.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:

- When the program splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]`, it only checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted. This is not sufficient because the operation should replace `arr[i - 1]` with its digits and then check if the entire array can be sorted.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where `arr[i - 1]` is split into multiple digits and these digits need to be inserted back into the array in the correct position.

To correct this, the program should:
- Split `arr[i - 1]` into its digits.
- Insert these digits back into the array at the correct position.
- Check if the entire array is sorted after the insertion.

Given the current implementation, the program will not correctly handle all cases where the array needs to be transformed to be sorted.

Correctness: **False**
