The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from standard input (stdin) which includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. The function processes these test cases and outputs the results to standard output (stdout).

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers. It processes each test case and outputs the results to standard output.**
