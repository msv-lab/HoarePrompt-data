Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `ntest` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements of the first half of the sorted list. This sum is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `ntest` remains the same, `n` is the last input integer read, `a` is the last list of integers read and sorted, and the sum of the differences for the last test case is printed. **
