### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The problem description mentions that the input will contain multiple test cases, but the provided function `func()` does not handle this. It only processes a single input string. This is a significant oversight, as the function should be able to handle multiple test cases as specified.

2. **Finding the First and Last 'B':**
   - The function correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of 'B' (`ind1`) and the index of the last occurrence of 'B' (`ind2`), but there is a mistake in how `ind2` is calculated. The index `ind2` is calculated from the end of the string, which means it should be adjusted to reflect the correct position in the string. The correct position of the last 'B' should be `len(inpstr) - ind2 - 1`.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length:**
   - The function attempts to calculate the minimum segment length by subtracting `ind1` and `ind2` from the length of the input string. However, this calculation is incorrect. The correct minimum segment length should be the difference between the last and first 'B' indices plus one, i.e., `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated value, but due to the incorrect calculation, the output will not be correct.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
- The function does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.
- The calculation of `ind2` is incorrect, as it should be adjusted to reflect the correct position from the start of the string.
- The formula used to calculate the minimum segment length is incorrect. It should be `ind2 - ind1 + 1` instead of `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def solve_test_case(n, s):
    ind1 = s.find('B')
    ind2 = s.rfind('B')
    return ind2 - ind1 + 1

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        print(solve_test_case(n, s))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

- **`solve_test_case(n, s)`:** This function takes the length `n` and the string `s` as input and returns the minimum segment length required to paint all cells white.
- **`func()`:** This function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `solve_test_case(n, s)` and printing the result.
