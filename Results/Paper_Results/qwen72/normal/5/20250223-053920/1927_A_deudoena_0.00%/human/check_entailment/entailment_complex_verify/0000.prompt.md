You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` is the input string provided by the user, `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` is the input string provided by the user, `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` (counting from the end of the string), `outind` is 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an input string from the user, which is expected to be a string of length `n` (1 <= n <= 10) consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character. The function calculates the difference between the length of the input string and the sum of the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string (with the last occurrence index counted from the end of the string). It then prints this calculated value. After the function concludes, the input string and the calculated value are no longer accessible outside the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the input format as described in the problem statement. The problem specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, each with a length `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. However, the program only reads a single string and does not account for the number of test cases `t` or the length `n` of the strip. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the strip is already entirely white, which should return 0 as the minimum length to be painted. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
6
WBBWBW
1
B
2
WW
```

Expected Output:
```
4
1
0
```

Actual Output:
```
4
1
2
```

The program incorrectly outputs 2 for the third test case, where the strip is already entirely white, and no painting is needed. The correct output should be 0.
