It seems there's a mismatch in the function definition provided and the problem description. The function should accept parameters based on the problem description. Let's correct the function definition and then extract the precondition.

Function definition:
```
def distribute_coins(t, cases):
```

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each element in cases is a list containing two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
