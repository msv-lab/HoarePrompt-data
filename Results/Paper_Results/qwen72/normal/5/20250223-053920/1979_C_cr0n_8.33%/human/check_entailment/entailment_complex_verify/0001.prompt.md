You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each element in cases is a list containing two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`.

    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: - The code will print the integer `-1`.
        #
        #Output:

        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty.
    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`, `den` is the value of `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: - The output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod`.
    #
    #Given the initial state, the elements in `vprod` are the results of `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`. Therefore, the output will be a space-separated string of these values.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers from the input. It calculates the product of all integers in the list and then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding integer in the input list. The function then calculates a value `den` as the product minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod` and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`N`) and the multipliers for each outcome (`vals`).

2. **Solution Approach**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It then computes the value `vprod` for each outcome, which is the product of all multipliers divided by the multiplier for that outcome.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as the product of all multipliers minus the sum of the `vprod` values.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating that no valid distribution of coins is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `vprod` values as the bets for each outcome.

3. **Mathematical Validity**:
   - The approach is based on the idea that the total bet should be less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The total bet is the sum of the `vprod` values.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is `k_i * vprod[i]`.
   - The program ensures that `k_i * vprod[i] > sum(vprod)` for all i, which is the required condition.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all multipliers are the same, the sum of `vprod` values will be `n * (prod // k_i)`, and `prod - sum(vprod)` will be `prod - n * (prod // k_i)`.
   - If `k_i` is the same for all outcomes, the program will correctly identify that no valid distribution exists if `prod - n * (prod // k_i) <= 0`.

5. **Output Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the bets `x_i` are integers and within the range `1 \le x_i \le 10^9`.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic and handles the problem as described. It correctly identifies when a valid distribution is possible and when it is not. The mathematical approach is sound and the implementation is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
