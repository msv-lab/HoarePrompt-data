You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each element in cases is a list containing two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: - The code will print the integer `-1`.
        #
        #Output:
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty.
    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`, `den` is the value of `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: - The output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod`.
    #
    #Given the initial state, the elements in `vprod` are the results of `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`. Therefore, the output will be a space-separated string of these values.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
