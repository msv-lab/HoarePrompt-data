The only objects in the loop head are `val_b` and `main_ar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `main_ar`. If `main_ar` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `sec_arr` and `sub_summ` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `main_ar` must have at least one element, and `val_b` will be the first element of `main_ar`.

State: **`main_ar` must have at least one element, `val_b` is the first element of `main_ar`, `sec_arr` remains unchanged, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`**
