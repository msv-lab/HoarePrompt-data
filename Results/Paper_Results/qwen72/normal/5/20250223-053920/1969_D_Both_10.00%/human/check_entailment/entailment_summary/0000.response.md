### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and returns it as an integer. This is correct and matches the problem description.
   - `func_2` reads a line of input, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns a map object. This is used to read the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` in the main program. This is also correct and follows the problem's input format.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it initializes empty lists `arr`, `k_arr`, and `temp_pop`.
   - It reads `n` and `k` for the current test case.
   - It reads the prices `a` and `b` for Alice and Bob, respectively, and stores them in lists.
   - It converts the prices in `a` to negative values to use a min-heap as a max-heap for Alice's prices.
   - It creates a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple contains the negative price for Alice and the price for Bob.
   - It sorts `arr` based on Bob's prices in ascending order. This is done to ensure that Bob takes the items with the lowest Bob prices for free, which is optimal for Bob.
   - It then pushes the last `k` items (those with the highest Bob prices) into the heap `k_arr` and removes them from `arr`.
   - It calculates the initial `sub_sum` using `func_3`, which sums the Alice prices in `k_arr` and adds the sum of Alice and Bob prices in `arr` where the sum is non-negative.
   - It updates `max_value` if `sub_sum` is greater than the current `max_value`.
   - It iterates over the remaining items in `arr`, adjusting `sub_sum` by removing the highest Bob price item from `k_arr` and adding the current item to `k_arr`. It also updates `sub_sum` by subtracting the Bob price of the current item and adding the Alice price if the sum of Alice and Bob prices is non-negative.
   - It updates `max_value` if the new `sub_sum` is greater than the current `max_value`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - `func_3` calculates the sum of Alice's prices for items in `sec_arr` and the sum of Alice's and Bob's prices for items in `main_ar` where the sum is non-negative. This is used to calculate the initial `sub_sum` and to update `sub_sum` during the iteration over the remaining items.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for determining the optimal profit for Alice is implemented by considering the items with the highest Bob prices for free and then adjusting the selection to maximize the profit.
- The use of a heap to manage the selection of items for Bob to take for free is appropriate, as it ensures that Bob always takes the items with the lowest Bob prices first, which is optimal for Bob.
- The program correctly updates the `sub_sum` and `max_value` to find the maximum profit for Alice.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
