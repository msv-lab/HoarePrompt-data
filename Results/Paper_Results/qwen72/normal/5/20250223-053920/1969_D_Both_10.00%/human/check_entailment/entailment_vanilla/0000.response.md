### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to read input. `func_1` reads a single integer, and `func_2` reads a list of integers. These functions are used to parse the input as specified in the problem description.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The function `func_3` is responsible for calculating Alice's profit. It takes two lists, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, as input.
   - `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the profit for Bob (i.e., `b_i - a_i`).
   - `main_ar` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the profit for Alice (i.e., `b_i - a_i`).

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `sub_summ` to 0, which will store the total profit.
   - It then adds the profit for Bob for all items in `sec_arr` to `sub_summ`.
   - Next, it iterates over `main_ar` and adds the profit for Alice to `sub_summ` if the profit is non-negative (i.e., `b_i - a_i >= 0`).

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should choose items such that the sum of `b_i - a_i` is maximized, but Bob will take the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` for free.
   - The program should sort the items based on `b_i - a_i` and then consider the items in descending order of profit for Alice.
   - Alice will choose the items with the highest profit until she has chosen `k` items. Bob will take the `k` items with the highest profit for free.
   - The remaining items will be sold to Bob, and Alice will profit from these items.

5. **Implementation Issues:**
   - The program does not sort the items based on `b_i - a_i`.
   - The program does not handle the case where Bob takes the `k` items with the highest profit for free.
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Alice's profit while considering Bob's optimal strategy.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the implementation, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
