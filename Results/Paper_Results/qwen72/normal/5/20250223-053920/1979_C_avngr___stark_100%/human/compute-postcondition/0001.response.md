The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers[1:]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the slice `numbers[1:]`. If this slice has at least one element, the loop will execute. Given that `numbers` is a non-empty list and `result` is equal to the first integer in the list `numbers`, the loop will start with `num` being the second element in the list `numbers`.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second integer in the list `numbers`, `result` is equal to the first integer in the list `numbers`**
