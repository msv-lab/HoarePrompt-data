Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `k_i` is the multiplier and `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM is calculated using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function is correct and works as expected for the given constraints.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers `numbers`.
   - It does this by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements of the list.
   - The function is correct and works as expected for the given constraints.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.
   - It calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then distributes the coins such that the bet on the i-th outcome is `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM.
   - The program checks if the sum of all bets is strictly less than `m`. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total sum of bets is a common multiple of all `k_i`.
   - The condition `sum(c) < m` ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If `sum(c) >= m`, it means there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

6. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input `3 2 7`, the LCM is 42. The bets are `[42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`. The sum of bets is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`, which is less than 42. The program correctly outputs `14 21 6`.
   - For the input `3 3`, the LCM is 3. The bets are `[3 // 3, 3 // 3] = [1, 1]`. The sum of bets is `1 + 1 = 2`, which is less than 3. The program correctly outputs `1 1`.
   - For the input `5 5 5 5 5`, the LCM is 5. The bets are `[5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The sum of bets is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`, which is not less than 5. The program correctly outputs `-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
