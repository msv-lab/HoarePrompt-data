The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` represents the length of the string `s`, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and the string `s` consists only of the characters '+' and '-', with the length of `s` equal to `n`.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is determined by the content of the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-'. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case, based on the content of the string `s`.**
