Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with a length at most 200, `size` is the largest size such that (1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number, `overlap` is the corresponding index from the sequence.**

Explanation: The tuple `size_overlap` is unpacked into the variables `size` and `overlap`. The value of `size` is the largest size such that (1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number, and `overlap` is the corresponding index from the sequence. The other variables (`number` and `sequence`) remain unchanged.
