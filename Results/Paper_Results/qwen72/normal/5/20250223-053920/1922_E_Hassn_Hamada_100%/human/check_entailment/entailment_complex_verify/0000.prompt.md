You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It modifies the `sequence` by appending integers to it and recursively calls itself until `number` is reduced to a value that no longer satisfies the condition for further processing. The function always returns the tuple (0, 0) regardless of the input. The final state of the program is that `number` is reduced, and `sequence` contains additional integers that were appended during the function's execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `X = 1`. According to the problem description, `X` should be in the range `[2, 10^18]`, but if we consider a slightly broader context, the program should ideally handle `X = 1` by returning an array with exactly one element, which has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the single-element subsequence). However, the function `func_1` is designed to generate sequences based on the assumption that `number >= 0`, and it does not handle the case where `number = 0` correctly. Specifically, the function returns `(0, 0)` when `number = 0`, which does not contribute to the sequence, and the program does not print the correct output for `X = 1`.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 correctly. For example, if `X = 8`, the program should generate an array with exactly 8 increasing subsequences, but the current logic in `func_1` may not produce the correct sequence for such inputs.

To further illustrate, let's consider the input `X = 8`:
- The program should generate an array with exactly 8 increasing subsequences.
- However, the current implementation of `func_1` might not produce the correct sequence, leading to an incorrect number of increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least these cases.
