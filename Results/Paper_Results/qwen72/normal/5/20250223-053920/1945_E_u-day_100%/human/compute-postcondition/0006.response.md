Output State: **`n` and `k` retain their original values, `arr` remains the same list, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes a new empty set `st`, but does not change the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid, with the addition of `st` being an empty set.
