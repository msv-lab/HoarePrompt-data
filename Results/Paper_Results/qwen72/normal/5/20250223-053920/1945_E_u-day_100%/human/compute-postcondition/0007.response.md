To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones involved in this condition, so we need to adjust their states if necessary.

Given:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`

For the loop to execute, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true. Substituting the given values:
- `0 + 1 < n` must be true, which simplifies to `1 < n`.

Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` and `k` retain their original values, `arr` remains the same list, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1, `st` is an empty set**.
