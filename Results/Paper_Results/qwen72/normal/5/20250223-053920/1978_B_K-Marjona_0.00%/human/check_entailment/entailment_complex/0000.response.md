### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation of `k`:**
   - The function calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is intended to determine the number of buns to be sold at the modified price. However, this calculation might be incorrect because `k` should be the minimum of `n` and `b` (not `b - a`), as per the problem statement.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, the function prints `a * n`, which is correct because if the modified price is not higher than the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price.
   - If `b > a`, the function prints a more complex expression: `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)`.
     - This expression is intended to calculate the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
     - The term `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k)` is supposed to calculate the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns. However, the division by 2 should be a floating-point division to correctly compute the average, and the result should be cast to an integer if necessary.
     - The term `(n - k) * a` correctly calculates the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function should handle the edge case where `k` is 0, which is correctly handled by the condition `if b <= a`.
   - The function should also handle large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` (up to \(10^9\)), which the current implementation does.

5. **Correct Calculation of `k`:**
   - The correct calculation of `k` should be `min(n, b)`, not `min(n, b - a)`. This is a critical mistake that affects the correctness of the profit calculation.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the calculation of `k`. The corrected program uses `k = min(n, b)`, which aligns with the problem statement.
- The rest of the logic in the original program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
