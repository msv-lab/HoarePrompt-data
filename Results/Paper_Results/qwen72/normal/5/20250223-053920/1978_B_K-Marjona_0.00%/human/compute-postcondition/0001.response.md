Output State: The function `func` will process each iteration of the loop based on the input values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will retain their last input values for the final iteration, and the loop will have printed the calculated results for each set of input values. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
