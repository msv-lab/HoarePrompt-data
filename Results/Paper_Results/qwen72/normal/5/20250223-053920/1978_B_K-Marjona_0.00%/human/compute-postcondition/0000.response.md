The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate, and it does not need to be adjusted explicitly. The state of `func` and its parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable**
