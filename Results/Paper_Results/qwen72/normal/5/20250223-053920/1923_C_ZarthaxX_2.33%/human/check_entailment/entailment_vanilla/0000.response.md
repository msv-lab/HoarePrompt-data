Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` of length `n`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, both of length `n + 1`.
   - `ones` is used to store the cumulative count of elements in `nums` that are equal to 1.
   - `sum` is used to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` for each element in `nums`.

3. **Cumulative Arrays**:
   - The program correctly updates the `ones` array to keep track of the cumulative count of 1s.
   - The `sum` array is correctly updated to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot be good (it cannot be replaced by a different positive integer).
   - For other queries, it calculates:
     - `onesInRange`: the number of 1s in the subarray `c[l-1]` to `c[r-1]`.
     - `sumInRange`: the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for the subarray `c[l-1]` to `c[r-1]`.

5. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good using the condition:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - Simplifying the left side of the inequality:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} = \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1)
     \]
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `nums[l-1]` to `nums[r-1]` can be matched by a different array `b` where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in `nums`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the condition is satisfied, otherwise 'NO'.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program appears to correctly handle the input, preprocess the data, and answer the queries based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
