### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it should take parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. However, since the function is designed to read input directly from `stdin`, it is not strictly incorrect, but it is not optimal for reusability or testing.

2. **Input Reading**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q` from the input.
   - It then reads the array `nums` (which should be `c` according to the problem statement) and initializes two lists `ones` and `sum` to keep track of the cumulative counts and sums.

3. **Cumulative Counts and Sums**:
   - The `ones` list is correctly populated to store the cumulative count of 1s up to each index.
   - The `sum` list is correctly populated to store the cumulative sum of the differences between each element and 1 up to each index.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the function correctly checks if the subarray is a single element. If so, it prints 'NO' because a single element cannot be different from itself.
   - It then calculates the number of 1s in the subarray and the sum of the differences in the subarray.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray is good. This condition ensures that the sum of the differences is sufficient to allow for a valid transformation of the subarray.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions.
- The input and output handling is correct for the problem statement.
- The cumulative sums and counts are correctly calculated and used in the query processing.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
