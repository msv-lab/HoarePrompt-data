Precondition: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of the array `c` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the subarray for each query.**
