The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the state of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, `queries`, `ones`, and `sum` does not directly affect whether the loop can execute, but `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once. The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment up to `n`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer provided by the user input, `t` is the number of test cases, `c` is a list of positive integers, `queries` is a list of tuples, `ones` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `sum` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1**
