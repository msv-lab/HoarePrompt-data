You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of the array `c` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the subarray for each query.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: `ones` is a list where `ones[i]` contains the count of 1s in the sublist `nums[0:i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. `sum` is a list where `sum[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in the sublist `nums[0:i]` and 1 for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The values of `ones` and `sum` remain unchanged. The values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` also remain unchanged. The loop has processed `q` queries, and for each query, it has printed 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `c` of positive integers, and a list of `queries` where each query is a tuple of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function returns the maximum value in the subarray of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
