Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (N and M) and the initial state of the field, including the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger. It stores these positions in appropriate data structures (`players`, `goals`, `quidditch`).

2. **Movement Function**: The `func_1` function is intended to handle the movement of entities (players, Bludger) on the field. However, there is a critical issue in this function. The function is supposed to return the new position of the entity after moving, but it incorrectly assigns `dx` and `dy` from the `b` parameter, which is a tuple from the `mouvements` dictionary. The function should return `(x + dx, y + dy)` but instead returns `(x + dx, y + dy)` with `dx` and `dy` not being integers but tuples. This will cause a `TypeError` when the function is called.

3. **Action Handling**:
   - **Movement (U, D, L, R)**: The program correctly updates the position of the player and checks for collisions with the Bludger. If a collision occurs, the player is eliminated, and the program correctly prints the elimination event and updates the state of the Quidditch game.
   - **Catching the Quaffle (C)**: The program attempts to update the player carrying the Quaffle, but it uses a comparison operator `==` instead of an assignment operator `=`. This means the Quidditch state is not updated correctly when a player catches the Quaffle.
   - **Throwing the Quaffle (T)**: The program correctly checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly. However, it does not handle the case where the player throws the Quaffle at a non-goal position, which should reset the Quaffle to the player's current position.

4. **Final Score**: The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Event Order**: The program correctly prints events in the order they occur, and it handles the elimination of multiple players at the same time by printing them in alphabetical order.

Given the issues identified, particularly the `TypeError` in `func_1` and the incorrect assignment in the `C` action, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
