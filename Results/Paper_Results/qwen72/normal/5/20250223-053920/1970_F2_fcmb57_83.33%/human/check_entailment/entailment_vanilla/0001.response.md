### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Parsing Input:**
   - The program correctly initializes the dimensions of the field `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `players` to store the positions of the players, a dictionary `goals` to store the positions of the goals, and a dictionary `mouvements` to map the movement directions.
   - The middle of the field is correctly calculated as `middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)`.
   - The initial position of the Quaffle is stored in `quidditch[0]`, and the player carrying the Quaffle is stored in `quidditch[1]`.
   - The initial points for both teams are set to zero.

2. **Field Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the field and populates the `players` and `goals` dictionaries.
   - It handles the special cases for empty cells, the Quaffle, and the goals.

3. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program reads the number of moves and processes each move.
   - For movement actions (U, D, L, R), it updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
   - It checks for collisions with the Bludger and prints the elimination event if a player is eliminated.
   - It correctly handles the case where the player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated, updating the Quaffle's position accordingly.

4. **Catching the Quaffle:**
   - The program attempts to update the player carrying the Quaffle with `quidditch[1] == mo[0]`, but this is incorrect. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player to the Quaffle.

5. **Throwing the Quaffle:**
   - The program correctly updates the Quaffle's carrier to an empty string when a player throws it.
   - It checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - It correctly prints the goal event and updates the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field if the goal is scored in the correct goal.
   - However, it incorrectly updates the Quaffle's position to the player's position if the goal is scored in the wrong goal. This should be fixed to always reset the Quaffle to the middle of the field.

6. **Final Score:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score after processing all the moves.

### Issues:
- **Catching the Quaffle:** The assignment `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is incorrect. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`.
- **Throwing the Quaffle:** The Quaffle's position should always be reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, regardless of which team scored it.

### Corrected Program:
```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        z = ''
        if '.B' in players:
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch = [v, '']
                    z = k
            if z != '':
                del players[z]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program has issues with the assignment of the player carrying the Quaffle and the reset of the Quaffle's position after a goal is scored. These issues need to be fixed for the program to be correct.
