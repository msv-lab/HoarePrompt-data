Output State: **The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the final state is that `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer representing the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The variables `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` are not retained after each iteration, so they do not have a final state outside the loop. The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked.**
