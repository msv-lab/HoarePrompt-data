The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `n` is an integer representing the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.**
