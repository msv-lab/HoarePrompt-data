You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving multiple test cases, each with the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`. The input for each test case includes `n`, `m`, and `k` as integers, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5`. Additionally, for each of the `m` pairs, there are three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the children in the pair and their initial friendship value, with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n`, `a_i ≠ b_i`, and `1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9`. The function should handle up to `5 * 10^4` test cases, with the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases not exceeding `10^5` and the sum of `k` not exceeding `2 * 10^5`.

    for i in range(int(input())):

        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: The function will print the result of `s % M` for each test case, where `s` is the cumulative sum of the expression `s + c * i * c * m + c * a` over `k` iterations, and `c` is the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `10^9 + 7`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a` will be reset for each test case, and the final state of these variables for each test case will be the state immediately after the last iteration of the inner `k` loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` pairs of integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. For each test case, it calculates a cumulative sum `s` based on the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `10^9 + 7`, the number of pairs `m`, and the sum of friendship values `a`. The final result for each test case is `s % M`, where `M` is `10^9 + 7`, and this result is printed. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and their final state is the state immediately after the last iteration of the inner `k` loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).

2. **Modulo Calculation**: The program defines \( M \) as \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is a common prime number used for modulo operations to prevent integer overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer data types.

3. **Probability Calculation**: The program calculates \( c \) as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs equiprobably, and the probability of choosing any specific pair is \( \frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \).

4. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The program initializes \( a \) to 0 and then reads the friendship values of the \( m \) pairs, summing them up in \( a \). This is correct because \( a \) represents the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values over \( k \) excursions. The expected value for each excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the chosen pairs being friends.

   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is \( \frac{m}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \). This is correctly calculated as \( c \cdot m \).
   - The expected value for the \( i \)-th excursion is \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \). This is because the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen, and the initial friendship value is \( a \).

6. **Summing Expected Values**: The program sums the expected values for all \( k \) excursions and takes the result modulo \( M \).

7. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The use of `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` to calculate the modular inverse is correct. This ensures that the division is performed correctly under modulo \( M \).

- **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value calculation is correct but can be simplified. The expected value for each excursion is \( c \cdot a + c \cdot m \cdot i \). Summing this over \( k \) excursions gives:
  \[
  \text{Total Expected Value} = c \cdot a \cdot k + c \cdot m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2}
  \]
  This can be simplified to:
  \[
  \text{Total Expected Value} = c \cdot (a \cdot k + m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2})
  \]

- **Efficiency**: The program iterates over \( k \) excursions, which can be optimized. The simplified formula above avoids the need for a loop over \( k \), making the program more efficient.

### Correctness:

The program is correct in its logic and calculations, but it can be optimized to avoid the loop over \( k \) excursions. However, the current implementation will still produce the correct result for the given problem constraints.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
