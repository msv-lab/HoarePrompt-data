Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case. It also reads the friendship pairs and their initial values.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The program calculates the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `10^9 + 7` using the `pow` function. This is necessary because the probability of choosing a specific pair of children is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, and we need to handle this in modular arithmetic.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The program correctly sums the initial friendship values of all pairs.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each chosen pair over `k` excursions. However, the formula used in the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` seems incorrect.

   - The term `c * i * c * m` is intended to account for the increase in friendship values due to the pairs being chosen in previous rounds. However, this term is not correctly formulated.
   - The term `c * a` correctly adds the initial friendship values scaled by the probability of choosing a friend pair.

5. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each chosen pair over `k` excursions should be:
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the number of pairs chosen so far (since each chosen pair increases their friendship value by 1 for all subsequent excursions).
   - The expected value for each excursion is `c * (a + i)`, where `i` is the current excursion number (starting from 0).

6. **Summation**: The summation should be:
   - `s = s + c * (a + i)` for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`.

7. **Output**: The program correctly prints the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used in the loop.

Correctness: **False**
