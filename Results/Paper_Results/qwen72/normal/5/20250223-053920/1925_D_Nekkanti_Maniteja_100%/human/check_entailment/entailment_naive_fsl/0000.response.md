Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the way the expected value is computed in the loop:

```python
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```

This loop incorrectly updates the sum `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each excursion. The correct approach should consider the expected increase in friendship value for each pair chosen, which should be the initial friendship value plus the number of excursions they have been chosen before.

The correct expected value for each pair chosen in an excursion should be calculated as follows:
- The probability of choosing a friend pair in any given excursion is `m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
- The expected increase in friendship value for each friend pair chosen in an excursion is the initial friendship value plus the number of times they have been chosen before.

The program should update the expected sum correctly by considering the cumulative effect of each excursion. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
The correct output should be `40000020` (as given in the problem description), but the provided program will output a different value due to the incorrect calculation in the loop.
