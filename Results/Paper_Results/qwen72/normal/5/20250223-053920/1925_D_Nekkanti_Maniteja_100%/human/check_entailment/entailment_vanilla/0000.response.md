### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).

2. **Modulo Calculation**: The program defines \( M \) as \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is a common prime number used for modulo operations to prevent integer overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer data types.

3. **Probability Calculation**: The program calculates \( c \) as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs equiprobably, and the probability of choosing any specific pair is \( \frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \).

4. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The program initializes \( a \) to 0 and then reads the friendship values of the \( m \) pairs, summing them up in \( a \). This is correct because \( a \) represents the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values over \( k \) excursions. The expected value for each excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the chosen pairs being friends.

   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is \( \frac{m}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \). This is correctly calculated as \( c \cdot m \).
   - The expected value for the \( i \)-th excursion is \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \). This is because the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen, and the initial friendship value is \( a \).

6. **Summing Expected Values**: The program sums the expected values for all \( k \) excursions and takes the result modulo \( M \).

7. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The use of `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` to calculate the modular inverse is correct. This ensures that the division is performed correctly under modulo \( M \).

- **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value calculation is correct but can be simplified. The expected value for each excursion is \( c \cdot a + c \cdot m \cdot i \). Summing this over \( k \) excursions gives:
  \[
  \text{Total Expected Value} = c \cdot a \cdot k + c \cdot m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2}
  \]
  This can be simplified to:
  \[
  \text{Total Expected Value} = c \cdot (a \cdot k + m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2})
  \]

- **Efficiency**: The program iterates over \( k \) excursions, which can be optimized. The simplified formula above avoids the need for a loop over \( k \), making the program more efficient.

### Correctness:

The program is correct in its logic and calculations, but it can be optimized to avoid the loop over \( k \) excursions. However, the current implementation will still produce the correct result for the given problem constraints.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
