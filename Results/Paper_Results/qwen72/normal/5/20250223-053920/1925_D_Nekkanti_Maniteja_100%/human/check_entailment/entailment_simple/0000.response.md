Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and initializes `M` to `10^9 + 7`.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`. This is correct because `n * (n - 1) // 2` is the number of possible pairs of children, and `c` is used to normalize the probability of selecting a pair.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The function reads the `m` pairs of friends and their initial friendship values, and sums these values into `a`. This is correct as it correctly accumulates the initial friendship values.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The function then iterates `k` times to calculate the expected sum of friendship values.
   - The expression `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is intended to update the sum `s` for each excursion.
   - However, this expression is incorrect. The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the pairs being chosen.

4. **Correct Expression**:
   - The correct expression for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should be:
     \[
     s = s + c \cdot a + c \cdot m \cdot i
     \]
   - Here, `c * a` accounts for the initial friendship values, and `c * m * i` accounts for the expected increase in friendship values due to the pairs being chosen in previous excursions.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The function correctly uses modular arithmetic to ensure that the result is within the range of `10^9 + 7`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result of `s % M` for each test case, which is the correct way to handle the output.

Given the incorrect expression in the loop, the program will not produce the correct expected values for the sum of friendship values.

Correctness: **False**
