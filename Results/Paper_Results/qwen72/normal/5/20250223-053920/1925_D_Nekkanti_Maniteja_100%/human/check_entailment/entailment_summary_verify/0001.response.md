### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).

2. **Modulo Calculation**: The program defines \( M \) as \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is a common prime number used for modulo operations to prevent integer overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer data types.

3. **Probability Calculation**: The program calculates \( c \) as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs equiprobably, and the probability of choosing any specific pair is \( \frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \).

4. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The program initializes \( a \) to 0 and then reads the friendship values of the \( m \) pairs, summing them up in \( a \). This is correct because \( a \) represents the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value for each excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the chosen pairs being friends.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is \( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \), which is correctly calculated as \( c \cdot m \).
   - The expected value for the \( i \)-th excursion is \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \). This is because the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen, and the initial friendship value is \( a \).

6. **Summing Expected Values**:
   - The program sums the expected values for all \( k \) excursions and takes the result modulo \( M \).
   - The formula used in the loop is:
     \[
     s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
   - This can be simplified to:
     \[
     s = c \cdot \left( a \cdot k + m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \right)
     \]
   - The current implementation, while correct, is not the most efficient. However, it will still produce the correct result for the given problem constraints.

7. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The use of `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` to calculate the modular inverse is correct. This ensures that the division is performed correctly under modulo \( M \).

- **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value calculation is correct but can be simplified. The simplified formula:
  \[
  \text{Total Expected Value} = c \cdot (a \cdot k + m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2})
  \]
  avoids the need for a loop over \( k \) excursions, making the program more efficient.

- **Efficiency**: The current implementation iterates over \( k \) excursions, which can be optimized. However, the current implementation is still within the acceptable time complexity for the given constraints.

### Correctness:

The program is correct in its logic and calculations. The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program will produce the correct result, but it can be optimized for better performance.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**
