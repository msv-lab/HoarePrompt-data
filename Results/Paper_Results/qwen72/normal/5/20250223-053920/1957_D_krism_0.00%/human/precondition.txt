The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function should handle up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
