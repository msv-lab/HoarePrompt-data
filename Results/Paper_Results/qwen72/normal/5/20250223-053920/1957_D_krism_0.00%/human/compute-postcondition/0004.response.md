To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects present in the loop head, which are `v` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` is not empty. The other variables mentioned in the state before the loop (such as `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `prefix`) are not directly involved in the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `prefix` is a list containing a single element, 0.

For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. The variable `v` will take on the value of the first element in `arr` at the start of the loop.

State: **`arr` must contain at least one integer, `v` is the first integer in `arr`**
