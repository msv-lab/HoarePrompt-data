#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 inclusive (1 <= len(arr) <= 100), with each stick length being between 1 and 100 inclusive (1 <= a_i <= 100).
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `arr`, and the corresponding value is the frequency (count) of that stick length in `arr`. The list `arr` remains unchanged.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency value by 3, where the frequency values are the counts of each unique stick length in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick. The function returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 3. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
