### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of determining whether, after `n` moves, a tower can have exactly `m` cubes. The problem specifies that in each move, Nikita can either add or remove one cube from the tower. Therefore, the key to solving this problem is to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even (since each pair of moves can cancel each other out).

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it simply checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise. This is incorrect because:

- If `n` is 2 and `m` is 4, the program will print "No" even though it is possible to end up with 4 cubes after 2 moves (by adding a cube twice).
- If `n` is 3 and `m` is 1, the program will print "Yes" even though it is not possible to end up with 1 cube after 3 moves (since the only possible outcomes are 0, 2, or 3 cubes).

The correct logic should be to check if the difference `n - m` is even. If it is, then it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves; otherwise, it is not.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It should check if the difference `n - m` is even, rather than just checking if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
