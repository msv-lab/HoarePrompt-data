You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, where both `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, which are split and converted to integers. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `n` is less than `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the user input, where both integers are expected to be between 1 and 100. It then compares `n` and `m`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value and does not handle multiple test cases as described in the annotations. After the function concludes, `n` and `m` retain their values from the input, and the program state is unchanged except for the printed output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the top of the tower in one move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes in the tower after \( n \) moves.
   - The key observation is that after \( n \) moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer from 0 to \( n \) (inclusive) if \( n \) is even, and from 1 to \( n \) (inclusive) if \( n \) is odd. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and starting from 0, the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes will match the parity of the number of moves.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - The program checks if \( n \ge m \). If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

3. **Identifying the Flaw:**
   - The program's logic is incorrect because it only checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \). This is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.
   - The correct condition should be that \( m \) must be within the range of possible cube counts after \( n \) moves, which is from 0 to \( n \) if \( n \) is even, and from 1 to \( n \) if \( n \) is odd. This can be simplified to checking if \( m \le n \) and \( (n - m) \) is even.

4. **Correct Condition:**
   - The correct condition to check is:
     - \( m \le n \) (to ensure \( m \) is within the possible range of cube counts)
     - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) (to ensure the parity of \( n \) and \( m \) match, which is necessary for the tower to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves).

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not consider the parity of the number of moves and the number of cubes. It only checks if \( n \ge m \), which is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:
**False**
