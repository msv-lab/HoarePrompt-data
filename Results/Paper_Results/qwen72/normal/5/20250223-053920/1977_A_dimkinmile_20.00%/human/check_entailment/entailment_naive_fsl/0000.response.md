Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the condition `if n >= m:` is insufficient. The correct condition should be `if (n - m) % 2 == 0:` because the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. The program will output "Yes" because `n >= m` is false, but the correct answer should be "No" because it is impossible to end up with 4 cubes after 2 moves. Similarly, for the test case `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the program will output "Yes" because `n >= m` is true, but the correct answer should be "Yes" because it is possible to end up with 3 cubes after 5 moves (e.g., put 3 cubes, remove 1 cube, put 1 cube). 

Thus, the program is incorrect.
