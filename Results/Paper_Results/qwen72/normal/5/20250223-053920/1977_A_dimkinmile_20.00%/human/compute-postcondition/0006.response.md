The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where both `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. It also handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) and processes multiple test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
