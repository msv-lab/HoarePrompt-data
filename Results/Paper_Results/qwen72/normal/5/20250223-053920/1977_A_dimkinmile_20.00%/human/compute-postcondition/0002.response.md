Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are assigned values from the input, which are split and converted to integers.
- The current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `m`.

Given this information, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('Yes')
```

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Yes'`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `t` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement, as it is not dependent on any of these variables.

Output: **Yes**
