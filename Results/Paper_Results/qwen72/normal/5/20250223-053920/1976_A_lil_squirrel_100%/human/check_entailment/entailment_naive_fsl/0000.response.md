Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly verifies the strength of the password based on the given conditions:

1. **Password Composition**: The program checks that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This is implicitly handled by the logic that separates letters and digits into two lists.

2. **No Digit After a Letter**: The program checks that there is no digit that comes immediately after a letter. This is done by iterating through the password and checking if a letter is followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Digits Sorted in Non-decreasing Order**: The program checks that all digits in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.

4. **Letters Sorted in Non-decreasing Order**: The program checks that all letters in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- If the password contains only letters, it will check that they are sorted.
- If the password contains only digits, it will check that they are sorted.
- If the password contains both letters and digits, it will check that letters are sorted, digits are sorted, and no digit comes after a letter.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and the problem description, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
