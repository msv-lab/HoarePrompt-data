Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to check if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Separation of Characters**: It separates the characters in the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.

3. **Sorting Check**: It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order and if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Order Check**: It ensures that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking the condition. If a digit follows a letter, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Return**: If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
