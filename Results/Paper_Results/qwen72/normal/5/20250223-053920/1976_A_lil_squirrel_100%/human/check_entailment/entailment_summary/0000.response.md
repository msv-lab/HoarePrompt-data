Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of how it works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Separation of Characters**: Inside the function `func_1`, the program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.

3. **Sorting Check**: 
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Order of Characters**:
   - It iterates through the password to ensure that no letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such a sequence is found, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Check**: If all the conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles the following conditions:
- The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
- All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
- No digit should come immediately after a letter.

Given the execution summary, the program behaves as expected and matches the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
