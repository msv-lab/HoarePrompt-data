The only objects in the loop head are the loop variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be a positive integer. The state of `t`, `x`, and `n` does not directly affect the loop's execution, but they are part of the initial state provided.

Given the loop statement:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```
To ensure the loop can execute, the input provided to `int(input())` must be at least 1. The loop variable `_` is not used, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
