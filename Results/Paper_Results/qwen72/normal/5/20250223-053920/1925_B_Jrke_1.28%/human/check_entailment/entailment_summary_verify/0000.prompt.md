You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. It then calculates the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` (where `k = x // n`). If `k` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the maximum divisor found. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each case have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1. In such a case, the only way to break `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, making the GCD 1. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario. For example, if `x = 11` and `n = 3`, the program will output 1, which is correct, but it does so by default and not by correctly identifying that 11 is a prime number and the only valid sub-problems are `[1, 1, 9]`, `[1, 2, 8]`, etc., all of which have a GCD of 1. The program should explicitly check if `x` is a prime number and handle this case appropriately.
