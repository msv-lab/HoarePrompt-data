The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from user input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. It then calculates the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` (where `k = x // n`). If `k` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the maximum divisor found. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each case have been printed.
