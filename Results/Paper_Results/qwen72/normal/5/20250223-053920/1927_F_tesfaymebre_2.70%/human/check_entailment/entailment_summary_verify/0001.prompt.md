You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases from the function `func_1` and then calls the function `func_6` that many times. After the function concludes, the variable `test_cases` holds the value returned by `func_1`, and no other variables are affected. The function does not return any value, so it may return `None` by default.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, and then reads the edges and their weights.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, which is appropriate for an undirected graph.
   - The edges are stored in a list, and each edge is represented as a tuple `(w, u, v)` where `w` is the weight, and `u` and `v` are the vertices.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This is a crucial step because the goal is to find a cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. By processing the edges in descending order, the program ensures that it considers the heaviest edges first, which helps in avoiding cycles with heavier edges.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The program uses a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `DSU` class should have methods for `find` and `union`, and it should also keep track of the minimum edge weight in each component. However, the `DSU` class is not defined in the provided code, which is a significant issue.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program attempts to detect cycles by checking if the two vertices of an edge are in the same connected component before performing a union operation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.

6. **DFS for Cycle Traversal**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to traverse the graph and find the cycle.
   - The function uses a `colors` array to keep track of the state of each vertex (0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited).
   - The function correctly appends the current vertex to the path and returns the path if a cycle is detected.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where the cycle is detected and the path needs to be trimmed to only include the cycle.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
- **Missing DSU Class**: The `DSU` class is not defined in the provided code. This is a critical error as the program relies on the `DSU` class for union-find operations and tracking the minimum edge weight.
- **Cycle Traversal**: The `dfs` function does not correctly handle the trimming of the path to only include the cycle. It should return the path from the first repeated vertex to the current vertex to form the cycle.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the missing `DSU` class and the incorrect handling of the cycle traversal, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
