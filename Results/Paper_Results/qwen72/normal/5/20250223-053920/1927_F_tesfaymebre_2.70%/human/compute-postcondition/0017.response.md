Functionality: ** The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of vertices and edges in an undirected graph from the `func_3` function. It then constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph and a list of edges, each with a weight, and sorts the edges in non-increasing order of their weights. Using a union-find data structure (`DSU`), it processes the edges to find the minimum weight edge that successfully connects two previously unconnected components. The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the vertices of this minimum weight edge and prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices visited during the DFS. It also prints the list of vertices visited during the DFS traversal. The final state of the program includes an updated union-find data structure, a sorted list of edges, and the printed results. **
