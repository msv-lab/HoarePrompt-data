To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
1. **`graph`**: A `defaultdict` of type `list` containing adjacency lists for each vertex. This means for each vertex, there is a list of vertices it is connected to.
2. **`edges`**: A list of edges sorted in descending order based on their weights.
3. **`DSU` class**: A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find data structure is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
4. **`colors`**: A list of zeros with length `n + 1`. This list is used to keep track of the colors of the vertices, but it is currently all zeros.
5. **`dsu` instance**: The `dsu` instance has updated its parent and rank information to reflect the union operations performed.
6. **`_min_edge`**: The minimum edge weight that was successfully unioned.
7. **`node_u` and `node_v`**: The vertices that were part of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully unioned.
8. **`res`**: The result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*res)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`dfs` Function**: The `dfs` function is called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list. The `dfs` function typically explores the graph starting from `node_u` and returns a list of some form of result. The `-1` parameter is often used to represent the parent node in the DFS traversal, and the empty list is used to store the result.

2. **`res` Variable**: The `res` variable holds the result of the `dfs` function. Since the exact implementation of the `dfs` function is not provided, we can only infer based on common usage:
   - If the `dfs` function is used to find a path or a set of nodes, `res` will likely be a list of nodes or edges.
   - If the `dfs` function is used to compute some value, `res` will be a list containing that value.

3. **`print(*res)`**: The `print(*res)` statement unpacks the list `res` and prints its elements separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces. The exact content of `res` depends on the implementation of the `dfs` function, but based on the information provided, we can describe it as follows:

- **`res`**: The result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list. This could be a list of nodes, edges, or some other computed values depending on the specific implementation of `dfs`.

Since the exact implementation of `dfs` is not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms:

Output: **[elements of res separated by spaces] (where res is the result of the dfs function called with node_u, -1, and an empty list)**

If you can provide more details about the `dfs` function, I can give a more precise description of the output.
