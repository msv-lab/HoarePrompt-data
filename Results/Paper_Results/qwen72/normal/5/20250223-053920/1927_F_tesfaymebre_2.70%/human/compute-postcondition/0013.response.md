Output State: **The `graph` remains a defaultdict of type `list` containing the adjacency lists for each vertex. The `edges` list is still sorted in descending order based on the weight of the edges. The `DSU` class and the `colors` list remain unchanged, but `colors` is now a list of zeros with length `n + 1`. The `dsu` instance has updated its parent and rank information to reflect the union operations performed. The `_min_edge` variable is set to the minimum edge weight that was successfully unioned. The `node_u` and `node_v` variables are set to the vertices that were part of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully unioned. The `res` variable is set to the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The `dfs` function is called with `node_u` as the starting node, `-1` as the parent node, and an empty list as the path.
- The result of this function call is stored in the `res` variable.
- All other variables and their states remain unchanged as they were not directly affected by the `dfs` function call.
