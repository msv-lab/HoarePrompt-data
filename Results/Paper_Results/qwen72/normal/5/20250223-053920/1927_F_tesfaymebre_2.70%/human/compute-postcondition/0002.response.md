Output State: **`test_cases` is assigned the value returned by `func_1()`. No other variables are affected.**

Explanation: The loop iterates `test_cases` times, and each iteration calls `func_6()`. However, since `func_6()` does not modify any variables or return any values that affect the loop or other variables, the state of `test_cases` remains unchanged after all iterations. No other variables are affected by the loop, so their state remains the same as in the initial state.
