Functionality: ** The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases from the function `func_1` and then calls the function `func_6` that many times. After the function concludes, the variable `test_cases` holds the value returned by `func_1`, and no other variables are affected. The function does not return any value, so it may return `None` by default. **
