### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state of the boxes `s1`, and the desired state of the boxes `s2`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`.
   - The function calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`).

3. **Calculations:**
   - `cats_to_add` is calculated by iterating over the indices of the strings `s1` and `s2` and counting the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1'. This represents the number of empty boxes that need to have a cat added.
   - `cats_to_remove` is calculated similarly by counting the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. This represents the number of boxes that need to have a cat removed.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`. This is because the scientists can only perform one operation per day, and the number of days required will be the larger of the two counts (since you can't add and remove a cat in the same day).

5. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic of the function is correct. The minimum number of days required to achieve the desired state is indeed the maximum of the number of cats to add and the number of cats to remove. This is because you can only perform one operation per day, and you need to account for the maximum number of operations required in either direction.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the initial and desired states are the same (resulting in 0 operations), or when all boxes need to be filled or emptied.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of days required to achieve the desired state of the boxes. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
