The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. The function returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, where `cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1', and `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It returns the maximum value between the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1' (cats_to_add) and the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' (cats_to_remove).**
