The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop can execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` as the loop iterates.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4.
- `cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `cases` does not need to be adjusted because it is not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 0**
