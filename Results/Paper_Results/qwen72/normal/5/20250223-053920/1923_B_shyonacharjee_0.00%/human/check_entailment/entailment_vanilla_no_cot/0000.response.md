Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the number of bullets that can be fired per second. The program checks if the total number of bullets needed to kill a monster exceeds the time available, but it does not consider the limit `k` on the number of bullets that can be fired each second. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        
        success = True
        for (position, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(position)
            time_available = distance
            bullets_needed = health
            if bullets_needed > time_available * k:
                success = False
                break
        
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

In this corrected version, the program checks if the number of bullets needed to kill a monster exceeds the product of the time available and the number of bullets that can be fired per second (`time_available * k`). This ensures that the program correctly accounts for the limit on the number of bullets that can be fired each second.
