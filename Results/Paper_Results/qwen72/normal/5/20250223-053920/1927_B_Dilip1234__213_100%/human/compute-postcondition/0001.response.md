Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros.**

The initial state remains unchanged, except that the variable `char_count` is now a list containing 26 zeros. This list is intended to store counts of characters, possibly from a string, with each index representing a different character (e.g., index 0 for 'a', index 1 for 'b', etc.).
