Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. This is in line with the problem description, which specifies that the first line of input contains the number of test cases.

2. **Reading Coordinates**: For each test case, the program reads four lines of coordinates and stores them in a list `a`. This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Extracting X-coordinates**: The program extracts the x-coordinates from the list of points `a` and stores them in the list `x`. This step is valid and necessary for calculating the side length of the square.

4. **Calculating Side Length**: The program calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). This approach is correct because the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will indeed give the side length of the square.

5. **Calculating Area**: The program prints the area of the square by squaring the side length (`print(dx * dx)`). This is correct because the area of a square is given by the side length squared.

6. **Assumptions**: The problem guarantees that the input points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. Therefore, the program does not need to handle cases where the points do not form a valid square.

However, there is a potential issue with the program's approach to calculating the side length. While the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is correct for the side length, the same logic should also be applied to the y-coordinates to ensure that the side length is consistent. If the side length calculated from the x-coordinates and y-coordinates is different, it would indicate that the input points do not form a valid square, which contradicts the problem's guarantee. To be thorough, the program should verify that the side length calculated from the x-coordinates is the same as the side length calculated from the y-coordinates.

Despite this potential issue, the problem guarantees that the input points will always form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, the program will always work correctly under the given constraints.

Final: **True**
