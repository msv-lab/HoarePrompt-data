Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the square's corners. These coordinates are stored in a list `a` of four tuples.

2. **Extracting X-coordinates**:
   - The program extracts the x-coordinates from the list of tuples and stores them in a list `x`.

3. **Calculating Side Length**:
   - The side length of the square is calculated by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). This works because the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the x-coordinates of the corners will span the width of the square.

4. **Calculating and Printing the Area**:
   - The area of the square is calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

### Verification:

- **Input Handling**:
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the coordinates for each test case.
  - The coordinates are stored in a list of tuples, which is appropriate for the problem.

- **Side Length Calculation**:
  - The side length calculation is correct because the x-coordinates of the square's corners will always span the width of the square, and the y-coordinates will span the height. Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the width and height are equal, and thus `dx` (the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates) is the side length of the square.

- **Area Calculation**:
  - The area is calculated as `dx * dx`, which is the correct formula for the area of a square given its side length.

- **Output**:
  - The program prints the area for each test case, which matches the required output format.

### Edge Cases:

- **Valid Input**:
  - The program assumes valid input as described in the problem statement, which guarantees that the coordinates form a square with positive area and sides parallel to the axes. This assumption is reasonable and aligns with the problem's constraints.

- **Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating `t` times and processing each test case independently.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, calculates the side length of the square, computes the area, and prints the result for each test case. There are no apparent issues with the logic or the handling of the input and output.

Correctness: **True**
