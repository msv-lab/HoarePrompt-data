Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints the area of the largest square that can be formed using the given coordinates. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list of test cases is also unchanged. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads the coordinates of a square, calculates the side length of the square by finding the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, and then prints the area of the square (side length squared).**
