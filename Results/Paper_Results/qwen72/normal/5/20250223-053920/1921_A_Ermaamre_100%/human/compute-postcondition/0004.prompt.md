You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of 4 tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates x_i, y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        
        print(dx * dx)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints the area of the largest square that can be formed using the given coordinates. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list of test cases is also unchanged. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads the coordinates of a square, calculates the side length of the square by finding the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, and then prints the area of the square (side length squared).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing 4 tuples of coordinates (x_i, y_i) for the corners of a square. It returns a list of results indicating whether each set of coordinates forms a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
