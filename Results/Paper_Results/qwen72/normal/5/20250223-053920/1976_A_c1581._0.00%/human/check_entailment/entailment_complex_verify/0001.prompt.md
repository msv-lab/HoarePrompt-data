You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code:

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length of 1 to 20 characters.

    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():

            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: digits is a list containing all the digits from the string password, and letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string password.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digit is found.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'.
    #State: *`digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digit is found, and `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'.
    #State: *`digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password` or -1 if no digit is found, `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `password` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length of 1 to 20 characters. It returns 'NO' if any digit appears after a letter in the string or if the digits or letters in the string are not in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data`.
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating the password.
   - It initializes two lists, `digits` and `letters`, to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - It also keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), it returns 'NO' immediately, satisfying the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - After the loop, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If either check fails, it returns 'NO'.
   - If both checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

4. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list.
   - It prints the results, each on a new line, using `print('\n'.join(results))`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles passwords with only letters or only digits correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem guarantees that `1 \le n \le 20`).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to validate the passwords according to the problem's conditions.
