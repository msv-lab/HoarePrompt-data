### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the password string from the list `data`.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating the password.
   - It separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It checks if any digit appears after a letter in the password. If it does, the function returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is not, the function returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is not, the function returns 'NO'.
   - If all the conditions are satisfied, the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the password contains only letters or only digits.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem description guarantees that the length `n` is between 1 and 20, so this is not a concern).

4. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the input `12ac`, the function correctly returns 'YES' because the digits are sorted and there are no digits after letters.
   - For the input `123wa`, the function correctly returns 'NO' because the letters are not sorted.
   - For the input `allllmost`, the function correctly returns 'YES' because the password contains only letters and they are sorted.
   - For the input `ac123`, the function correctly returns 'NO' because a digit appears after a letter.
   - For the input `011679`, the function correctly returns 'YES' because the digits are sorted and there are no letters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. It separates the characters, checks the order of digits and letters, and ensures that no digit appears after a letter. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
