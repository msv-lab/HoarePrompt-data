Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data`.
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Password Validation**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating the password.
   - It initializes two lists, `digits` and `letters`, to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - It also keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), it returns 'NO' immediately, satisfying the condition that no digit should come after a letter.
   - This part of the function is correct and ensures that no digit appears after a letter.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - After the loop, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If either check fails, it returns 'NO'.
   - If both checks pass, it returns 'YES'.
   - This part of the function is correct and ensures that both the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list.
   - It prints the results, each on a new line, using `print('\n'.join(results))`.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles passwords with only letters or only digits correctly.
   - The problem guarantees that `1 \le n \le 20`, so the program does not need to handle empty passwords.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to validate the passwords according to the problem's conditions. The function `func_1` ensures that:
- No digit comes after a letter.
- All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The original assessment is accurate, and the program meets all the specified requirements.

Final: **True**
