Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Movement Function**: The movement function `func_1` is incorrectly defined. The movements should be:
   - 'L': (-1, 0) (move left)
   - 'R': (1, 0) (move right)
   - 'U': (0, -1) (move up)
   - 'D': (0, 1) (move down)

   However, the function `func_1` is defined with the correct movements, but the order of the coordinates is reversed. The function should be:
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       (x, y) = a
       (dx, dy) = b
       return (x + dx, y + dy)
   ```

2. **Handling the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the Quaffle's movement or the player's ability to catch and throw the Quaffle. The Quaffle's position should be tracked, and when a player catches it, the Quaffle's position should be updated to the player's position. When a player throws the Quaffle, it should be placed at the player's position, and the Quaffle's position should be reset to the middle of the field if a goal is scored.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is incomplete. The program should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring and reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Quaffle Position**: The Quaffle's initial position is not stored, and there is no mechanism to track its position throughout the game.

5. **Catching the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the action of catching the Quaffle. When a player catches the Quaffle, the Quaffle's position should be updated to the player's position, and the player should be marked as carrying the Quaffle.

6. **Throwing the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the action of throwing the Quaffle. When a player throws the Quaffle, the Quaffle should be placed at the player's position, and the player should no longer be marked as carrying the Quaffle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
quaffle_pos = None
carrying = None

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quaffle_pos = (x, y)
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

def move_entity(pos, direction):
    (x, y) = pos
    (dx, dy) = mouvements[direction]
    return (x + dx, y + dy)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    entity = mo[0]
    action = mo[1]
    
    if action in 'ULDR':
        players[entity] = move_entity(players[entity], action)
        if entity == carrying:
            quaffle_pos = players[entity]
    elif action == 'C':
        if quaffle_pos == players[entity]:
            carrying = entity
    elif action == 'T':
        if carrying == entity:
            quaffle_pos = players[entity]
            if quaffle_pos in goals['R']:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            elif quaffle_pos in goals['B']:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quaffle_pos = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
            carrying = None

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should correctly handle the game's rules and output the required events and final score.
