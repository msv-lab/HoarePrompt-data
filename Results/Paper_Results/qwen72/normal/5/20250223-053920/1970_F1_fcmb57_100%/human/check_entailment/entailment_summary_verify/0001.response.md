### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (N and M) and initializes the necessary data structures.
   - It reads the field and populates the `players` dictionary with player positions and the `goals` dictionary with goal positions for both teams.

2. **Movement Dictionary**:
   - The `mouvements` dictionary correctly maps the movement directions (U, D, L, R) to their respective changes in coordinates.

3. **Score Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the scores for both teams (`pointsb` for blue and `pointsr` for red) to zero.

4. **Action Parsing and Execution**:
   - The program reads the number of moves and then processes each move.
   - For each move, it checks the action type:
     - If the action is a movement (U, D, L, R), it updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
     - If the action is a throw (T), it checks if the player is at a goal position and updates the score accordingly.

5. **Goal Scoring**:
   - The program correctly checks if a player is at a goal position and updates the score for the appropriate team.
   - It also prints the scoring event with the correct timestamp.

6. **Final Score**:
   - After processing all the moves, the program prints the final score.

7. **Quaffle Handling**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the Quaffle's position or the actions of catching and throwing the Quaffle. However, the problem description guarantees that all actions are valid, so the program implicitly relies on this guarantee.

8. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to update the player's position based on the movement direction.
   - **Inaccuracy in Original Assessment**: The original assessment incorrectly states that `func_1` accepts two integers. In reality, `func_1` accepts a tuple `a` representing the current position and a tuple `b` representing the movement direction. It correctly unpacks these tuples and returns the new position as a tuple.

9. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where a player scores in their own goal by correctly updating the score for the opposing team.

10. **Output Format**:
    - The program correctly formats and prints the scoring events and the final score as required by the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was mostly accurate, but it had a minor inaccuracy regarding the parameters of the `func_1` function. The function `func_1` correctly handles the movement of players and updates their positions. Therefore, the program as a whole correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Final: **True**
