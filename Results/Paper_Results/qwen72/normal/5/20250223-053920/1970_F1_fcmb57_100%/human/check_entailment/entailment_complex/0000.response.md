Reasoning:  
The program provided has a critical issue in the function `func_1`. The function is expected to take a tuple representing the current position of a player (or the Quaffle) and a tuple representing the movement direction, and then return the new position after applying the movement. However, the function is incorrectly defined to accept two integers (`a` and `b`), and it attempts to unpack these integers into two variables each, which results in a `TypeError`.

Additionally, the function `func_1` is not correctly handling the movement of the player or the Quaffle. The movement should be applied to the player's current position, but the function does not ensure that the player stays within the field boundaries, which is a requirement according to the problem description.

The main loop of the program also has a logical issue. It checks if the player is in a goal and increments the score accordingly, but it does not reset the position of the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. This is a critical part of the problem's rules that is missing from the program.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
