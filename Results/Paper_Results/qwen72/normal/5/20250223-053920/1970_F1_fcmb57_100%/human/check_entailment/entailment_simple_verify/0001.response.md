Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (N and M) and initializes the necessary data structures.
   - It reads the field and populates the `players` dictionary with player positions and the `goals` dictionary with goal positions for both teams.

2. **Movement Dictionary**:
   - The `mouvements` dictionary correctly maps the movement directions (U, D, L, R) to their respective changes in coordinates.

3. **Score Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the scores for both teams (`pointsb` for blue and `pointsr` for red) to zero.

4. **Action Parsing and Execution**:
   - The program reads the number of moves and then processes each move.
   - For each move, it checks the action type:
     - If the action is a movement (U, D, L, R), it updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
     - If the action is a throw (T), it checks if the player is at a goal position and updates the score accordingly.

5. **Goal Scoring**:
   - The program correctly checks if a player is at a goal position and updates the score for the appropriate team.
   - It also prints the scoring event with the correct timestamp.

6. **Final Score**:
   - After processing all the moves, the program prints the final score.

7. **Quaffle Handling**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the Quaffle's position or the actions of catching and throwing the Quaffle. However, the problem description guarantees that all actions are valid, so the program implicitly relies on this guarantee.

8. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly updates the player's position based on the movement direction. However, the annotation mentions a potential issue with the function call, but this is incorrect. The function `func_1` is called with a tuple representing the player's current position and a tuple representing the movement direction, which is valid.

9. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where a player scores in their own goal by correctly updating the score for the opposing team.

10. **Output Format**:
    - The program correctly formats and prints the scoring events and the final score as required by the problem description.

11. **Potential Issues**:
    - The original assessment did not mention handling the Quaffle's position after a goal is scored. According to the problem description, the Quaffle should instantly move to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. This is not implemented in the given program, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the Quaffle's position is needed for subsequent actions.

Given the above reasoning, the program is mostly correct but lacks the implementation to reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. This omission could lead to incorrect behavior in scenarios where the Quaffle's position is important.

Final: **False**
