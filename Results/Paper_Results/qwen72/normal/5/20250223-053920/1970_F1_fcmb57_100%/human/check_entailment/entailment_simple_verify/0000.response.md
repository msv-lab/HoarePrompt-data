Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program indeed does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a red player scores in the red goal, the blue team should win a point, and vice versa. However, the current implementation only increments the score for the correct goal and does not account for scoring in the wrong goal. This can be demonstrated with the provided input:

```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T
```

In this case, the red player (R0) scores in the red goal (RG), but the program should print "4 BLUE GOAL" and update the score accordingly. The program fails to do this, leading to incorrect output.

Additionally, there is a minor issue in the `func_1` function where the coordinates are updated. The function is correctly defined and called, so this part of the code works as intended. However, the primary issue is the lack of handling for own goals.

Final: **False**
