### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Base Case:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_2` does not handle the base case where the array is already all zeros. However, this is not a critical issue because the problem description does not explicitly state that the array can be all zeros initially. The function `func_1` will correctly identify this case and return "YES".

2. **Incorrect Operation Logic:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the operation logic in `func_2` is flawed. The while loop in `func_2` is intended to perform the operation `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`, `a_i = a_i - 2`, and `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`, but the implementation is incorrect. The lines `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` are not performing the operation as described. Instead, they are decrementing `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` by the value of `list[i - 1]`, which is not the intended behavior.

3. **Incorrect Check for Zero Elements:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` checks if all elements are zero, but it is called after the operation logic in `func_2` has already potentially modified the array incorrectly. This leads to incorrect results. The function `func_1` is correct in its implementation, but it is being used on an incorrectly modified array.

4. **Necessary and Sufficient Condition:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the necessary and sufficient condition for the array to be transformable to all zeros is that the sum of the elements at even indices should be equal to the sum of the elements at odd indices. This is a key insight that the original program does not utilize.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly handle the operations as described in the problem and does not check the necessary and sufficient condition for the array to be transformable to all zeros. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
