Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Case Handling for \( k \geq 2 \)**:
   - The program checks if \( k \geq 2 \) and then further checks if \( n == k \). If \( n == k \), it prints an array of \( n \) elements, each equal to \( k \). This is incorrect because the array should have elements in the range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), and the elements should be such that exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If \( n \neq k \), the program prints \(-1\). This is also incorrect because there are valid arrays for \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \).

2. **Case Handling for \( k < 2 \)**:
   - For \( k = 1 \), the program prints an array of \( n \) elements, each equal to \( j + 1 \) where \( j \) ranges from 0 to \( n-1 \). This is correct for \( k = 1 \) because the array will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).
   - For \( k = 0 \), the program does not handle this case at all. It should print \(-1\) because there is no valid array with 0 sorted cyclic shifts.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to handle the following cases:

1. **If \( k = 0 \)**:
   - Print \(-1\) because no array can have 0 sorted cyclic shifts.

2. **If \( k = 1 \)**:
   - Print an array that is not sorted in any of its cyclic shifts except the original one. One simple way to achieve this is to print an array where the first element is the largest and the rest are in increasing order. For example, \([n, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1]\).

3. **If \( k \geq 2 \)**:
   - Print an array that has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. One way to achieve this is to create an array where the first \( k \) elements are in increasing order and the rest are all the same and larger than the first \( k \) elements. For example, \([1, 2, \ldots, k, 10^9, 10^9, \ldots, 10^9]\) where the last \( n - k \) elements are all \( 10^9 \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k == 0:
            print(-1)
        elif k == 1:
            print(*[n] + list(range(1, n)))
        else:
            if k > n:
                print(-1)
            else:
                print(*list(range(1, k + 1)) + [10**9] * (n - k))

func()
```

This program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.
