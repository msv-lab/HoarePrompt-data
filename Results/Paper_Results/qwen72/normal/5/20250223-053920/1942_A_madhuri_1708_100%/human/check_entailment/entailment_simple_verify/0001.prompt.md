You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required, and both are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function should return a list of n integers, each between 1 and 10^9, that satisfies the conditions, or -1 if no such array exists.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: The function will print either a list of n integers, each equal to k, if n == k and k >= 2, or -1 if k >= 2 and n != k, or a list of integers from 1 to n if k < 2. The loop will continue to read and process each line of input until all lines have been processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input using `[*open(0)]`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input. The first line is skipped using `[1:]`, and the remaining lines are processed one by one.
   - Each line is split into two integers `n` and `k` using `map(int, s.split())`.

2. **Conditions for Valid Array**:
   - The program checks if `k >= 2`. This is because if `k` is 1 or less, the problem is simpler and can be handled differently.
   - If `k >= 2`:
     - It then checks if `n == k`. If `n` equals `k`, it prints an array where all elements are `k`. This is because if `n` equals `k`, the array can be all the same value, and all cyclic shifts will be sorted.
     - If `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`. This is because if `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is not equal to `k`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, there is no way to construct an array such that exactly 2 out of 4 cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If `k < 2`:
     - It prints an array where each element is `j + 1` for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`. This is because if `k` is 1, the array can be a strictly increasing sequence, and only one cyclic shift (the original array) will be sorted. If `k` is 0, the array can be any sequence that is not sorted, and no cyclic shifts will be sorted.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the required output for each test case. If a valid array is found, it prints the array. If no valid array is found, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1` by printing a strictly increasing sequence.
- The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by printing an array where all elements are the same.
- The program correctly handles the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` by printing `-1`, as it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts in this scenario.
- The program correctly handles the case where `k == 0` by printing a strictly increasing sequence, which ensures no cyclic shifts are sorted.

However, there is a potential issue with the program's handling of the case where `k == 0`. The current implementation will print a strictly increasing sequence, which is not necessarily correct for `k == 0` because it should ensure that no cyclic shifts are sorted. A better approach would be to print an array that is not sorted in any cyclic shift, such as `[2, 1, 3, 4, ...]`.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k == 0` properly. It should print an array that ensures no cyclic shifts are sorted, not a strictly increasing sequence.
