The function reads multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, it processes `n` and `k` to print either a list of `n` integers where each integer is `k` if `k >= 2` and `n == k`, or `-1` if `k >= 2` and `n != k`, or a list of integers from 1 to `n` if `k < 2`. The function continues to read and process each line until all lines have been processed.
