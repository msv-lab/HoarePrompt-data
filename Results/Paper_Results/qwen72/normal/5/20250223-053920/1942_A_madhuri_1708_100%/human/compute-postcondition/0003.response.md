Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function returns a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9, that satisfies the conditions, or -1 if no such array exists.**
