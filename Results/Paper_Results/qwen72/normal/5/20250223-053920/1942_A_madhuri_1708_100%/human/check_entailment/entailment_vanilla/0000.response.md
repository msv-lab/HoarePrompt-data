### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input using `[*open(0)]`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input. The first line is skipped using `[1:]`, and the remaining lines are processed one by one.
   - Each line is split into two integers `n` and `k` using `map(int, s.split())`.

2. **Conditions for Valid Array**:
   - The program checks if `k >= 2`. This is because if `k` is 1 or less, the problem is simpler and can be handled differently.
   - If `k >= 2`:
     - It then checks if `n == k`. If `n` equals `k`, it prints an array where all elements are `k`. This is because if `n` equals `k`, the array can be all the same value, and all cyclic shifts will be sorted.
     - If `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`. This is because if `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is not equal to `k`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, there is no way to construct an array such that exactly 2 out of 4 cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If `k < 2`:
     - It prints an array where each element is `j + 1` for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`. This is because if `k` is 1, the array can be a strictly increasing sequence, and only one cyclic shift (the original array) will be sorted. If `k` is 0, the array can be any sequence that is not sorted, and no cyclic shifts will be sorted.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the required output for each test case. If a valid array is found, it prints the array. If no valid array is found, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1` by printing a strictly increasing sequence.
- The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by printing an array where all elements are the same.
- The program correctly handles the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` by printing `-1`, as it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts in this scenario.
- The program correctly handles the case where `k == 0` by printing a strictly increasing sequence, which ensures no cyclic shifts are sorted.

However, there is a potential issue with the program's handling of the case where `k == 0`. The current implementation will print a strictly increasing sequence, which is not necessarily correct for `k == 0` because it should ensure that no cyclic shifts are sorted. A better approach would be to print an array that is not sorted in any cyclic shift, such as `[2, 1, 3, 4, ...]`.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k == 0` properly. It should print an array that ensures no cyclic shifts are sorted, not a strictly increasing sequence.
