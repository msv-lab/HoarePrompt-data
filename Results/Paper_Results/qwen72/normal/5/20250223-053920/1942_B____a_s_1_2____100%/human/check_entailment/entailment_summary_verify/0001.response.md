### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - We need to reconstruct the permutation `p` from `a`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
   - For each `i`, `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]` implies that `p[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - a[i]`.
   - The MEX of the entire permutation `p` is `n` because `p` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the MEX of the entire permutation.
   - It then iterates from the last element of `a` to the first element.
   - For each `i`, it sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` to ensure that `mex` is the correct MEX for the sequence `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]`.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly reconstructs `p` by working backwards from the last element to the first.
   - The MEX is updated correctly to reflect the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program handles multiple test cases as required.

5. **Example Walkthrough:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
     - `n = 5`
     - Initialize `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]` and `mex = 5`.
     - For `i = 4`, `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`.
     - For `i = 3`, `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
     - For `i = 2`, `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`.
     - For `i = 1`, `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
     - For `i = 0`, `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.
     - Final `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.

   - **Test Case 2:**
     - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - `n = 5`
     - Initialize `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]` and `mex = 5`.
     - For `i = 4`, `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`.
     - For `i = 3`, `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`.
     - For `i = 2`, `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
     - For `i = 1`, `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
     - For `i = 0`, `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.
     - Final `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

   - **Test Case 3:**
     - `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
     - `n = 3`
     - Initialize `p = [-1, -1, -1]` and `mex = 3`.
     - For `i = 2`, `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`.
     - For `i = 1`, `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.
     - For `i = 0`, `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`.
     - Final `p = [2, 0, 1]`.
