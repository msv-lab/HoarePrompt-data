The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to `n-1` based on the values in `a` and a variable `mex` initialized to `n`. The function prints the calculated permutation `p` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are no longer in scope. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, and the permutations have been printed to the standard output.
