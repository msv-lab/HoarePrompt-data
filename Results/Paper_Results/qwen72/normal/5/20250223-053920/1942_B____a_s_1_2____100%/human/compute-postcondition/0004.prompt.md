You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [-1] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be 0 (since the loop has completed all its iterations), and for each test case, the list `p` will contain a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` in each iteration. The final value of `n` and the list `a` will remain unchanged for each test case, but they will be re-assigned in each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the list), and `a` (list of integers). It returns a valid permutation `p` for the given data, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation for the given data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
