### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a` of length `n`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The permutation `p` is initialized as a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the MEX of the permutation at the start.
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order. This is crucial because it allows us to determine the value of `p[i]` based on the values of `p` that have already been set in previous iterations.

3. **MEX Calculation and Update:**
   - For each index `i`, the value of `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
   - The `mex` is then updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet been used in the permutation.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `p` for each test case, the function prints the elements of `p`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
   - The permutation `p` is constructed such that `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for each `i`.
   - The MEX is correctly updated in each iteration to ensure that the permutation is valid.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - Output: `0 1 4 2 3`
  - Verification:
    - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1` (MEX of [0] is 1)
    - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1] is 2)
    - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2` (MEX of [0, 1, 4] is 2)
    - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1, 4, 2] is 3)
    - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2` (MEX of [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is 5)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Output: `0 1 2 3 4`
  - Verification:
    - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1` (MEX of [0] is 1)
    - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1] is 2)
    - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1, 2] is 3)
    - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1, 2, 3] is 4)
    - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] is 5)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
  - Output: `2 0 1`
  - Verification:
    - `a_1 = MEX(2) - 2 = -2` (MEX of [2] is 0)
    - `a_2 = MEX(2, 0) - 0 = 1` (MEX of [2, 0] is 1)
    - `a_3 = MEX(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 2` (MEX of [2, 0, 1] is 3)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a` for each test case. The logic and the implementation are sound, and the examples provided verify the correctness of the solution.
