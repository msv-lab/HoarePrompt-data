### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The permutation `p` is initialized with `-1` values, which is a good starting point to ensure that all elements are set to an invalid value initially.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible value for MEX in the permutation.

3. **Reversing the Array:**
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, from `n-1` to `0`. This is a crucial step because the MEX value for the entire permutation is known to be `n` initially, and as we move backwards, we can correctly determine the MEX for the prefix of the permutation.

4. **Calculating `p[i]`:**
   - For each index `i`, the program calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`. This is based on the given formula \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \), which can be rearranged to \( p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i \).
   - The variable `mex` is then updated to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not appeared in the permutation up to index `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, the program prints the elements of `p`.

### Validation of the Original Assessment:

- **Correctness of MEX Calculation:**
  - The MEX calculation is done correctly by starting with `mex = n` and updating it as the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` in each iteration. This ensures that the MEX value is always the smallest non-negative integer not present in the permutation up to the current index.

- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly. In this case, the loop will not run, and the single element of `p` will be set to `mex - a[0]`, which is `n - a[0]`.

- **Constraints:**
  - The program adheres to the constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the range of `t`, `n`, and `a_i`.

- **Example Verification:**
  - For the example input:
    - Test case 1: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
      - `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
      - `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
      - `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 2`
      - `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
      - `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
      - Output: `0 1 4 2 3`
    - Test case 2: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
      - `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = 4`
      - `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`
      - `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
      - `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
      - `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
      - Output: `0 1 2 3 4`
    - Test case 3: `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
      - `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = 1`
      - `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
      - `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = 0`
      - Output: `2 0 1`

### Final Evaluation:

The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` for every potential case. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program handles all constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
