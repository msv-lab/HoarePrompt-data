You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.

    t = int(input())

            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be 0 (since the loop has completed all its iterations), and for each test case, the list `p` will contain a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` in each iteration. The final value of `n` and the list `a` will remain unchanged for each test case, but they will be re-assigned in each iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to `n-1` based on the values in `a` and a variable `mex` initialized to `n`. The function prints the calculated permutation `p` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are no longer in scope. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, and the permutations have been printed to the standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` for every potential case. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length `n` of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` values.
   - It starts with the assumption that the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the permutation is `n`.
   - It iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation `p`.

This approach ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and updated for each step, and the permutation `p` is constructed in a way that satisfies the given conditions for `a`. The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, making it correct for every potential case.
