Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` for every potential case. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length `n` of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` values.
   - It starts with the assumption that the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the permutation is `n`.
   - It iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation `p`.

This approach ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and updated for each step, and the permutation `p` is constructed in a way that satisfies the given conditions for `a`. The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, making it correct for every potential case.
