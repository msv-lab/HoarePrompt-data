Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case. However, the variable `a` is not used, and the variable `n` is shadowed by the loop variable `num`, which is not a critical issue but can be confusing.

2. **List Construction and Sorting**: For each test case, the function reads the list of integers, converts them to integers, and sorts the list. This is correct because sorting the list ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which is necessary to maximize the score.

3. **Score Calculation**: The function iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair to the score. This is correct because the first element of each pair (after sorting) is the smaller of the two, and summing these values will give the maximum possible score.

4. **Output**: The function appends the calculated score for each test case to the `final` list and prints each score after processing all test cases. This is correct as it matches the expected output format.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if all numbers are the same, the score will be the sum of the smallest number in each pair, which is the correct result.

6. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The variable `a` is read but not used, and the variable `n` is shadowed by the loop variable `num`. This is not a functional issue but can be improved for clarity.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
