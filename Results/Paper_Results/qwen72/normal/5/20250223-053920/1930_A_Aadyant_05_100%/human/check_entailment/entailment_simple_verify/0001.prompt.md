You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an input integer, a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, final is a list of n integers where each integer is the sum of the smaller elements in each pair of sorted input integers.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: The list `final` remains unchanged, and all elements in `final` are printed one by one. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then enters a loop to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `a` (which is the number of pairs, `n`), and then reads a line of space-separated integers and converts them into a list `list2`.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The program sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the problem requires us to maximize the score by selecting the minimum of each pair. By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest elements are always chosen first, which helps in maximizing the score.

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair (i.e., the smaller element) to the score `s`.
   - This approach is correct because, in a sorted list, the first element of each pair will always be the minimum of that pair.

4. **Storing and Printing the Results:**
   - The score `s` for each test case is appended to the list `final`.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints each score in the `final` list.

### Potential Issues:
- **Input Reading:**
  - The program reads the number of elements `a` but does not use it. This is not a problem because the number of elements is always `2n`, and the program correctly reads `2n` elements from the input.
  - The program reads the number of elements `a` as a separate input, which is not necessary and can be removed for clarity.

- **Variable Naming:**
  - The variable names `list1` and `list2` are somewhat confusing. `list1` is used to store the input string, and `list2` is used to store the integers. It would be clearer to use more descriptive names.

- **Type Conversion:**
  - The program converts the input string to integers correctly using `int(str)`.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is functionally correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description. The only minor issue is the unnecessary reading of the number of elements `a`, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:
**True**
