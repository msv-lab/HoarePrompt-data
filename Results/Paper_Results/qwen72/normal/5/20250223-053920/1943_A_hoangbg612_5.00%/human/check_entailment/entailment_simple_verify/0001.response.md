### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is a good approach because it helps in efficiently finding the MEX by iterating through the sorted elements.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1. This variable is intended to keep track of the current MEX value as we iterate through the sorted array.

4. **Building the MEX Dictionary:**
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the array.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is exactly `cur + 1`. If it is, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop. This is because the smallest missing integer is `cur + 1`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of the values in the dictionary `M` equals `S`. This step is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because the MEX is already determined by the smallest missing integer.
   - The program then iterates through the range of `cur` to find the smallest index `i` where `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. This is incorrect because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c` after all elements have been chosen, and the dictionary `M` should not be used in this way.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `cur` for each test case.

### Issues:
- The final MEX calculation logic is flawed. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c` after all elements have been chosen. The dictionary `M` is not correctly used to determine this.
- The condition `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
- The loop `for i in range(cur):` and the condition `if M[i] <= i:` are incorrect and do not correctly determine the MEX.

### Correct Approach:
- After sorting the array, the MEX can be determined by iterating through the sorted array and checking for the smallest missing integer.
- Alice and Bob's optimal strategy is to ensure that the smallest missing integer is as large as possible for Alice and as small as possible for Bob. However, since Alice always goes first and both play optimally, the MEX will be determined by the smallest missing integer in the sorted array.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = 0
        for num in N:
            if num == cur:
                cur += 1
        print(cur)
```

### Explanation:
- The program initializes `cur` to 0.
- It iterates through the sorted array `N`.
- If the current element `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments `cur` by 1.
- After the loop, `cur` will be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array, which is the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The given program is **incorrect** due to the flawed MEX calculation logic.

Final: **False**
