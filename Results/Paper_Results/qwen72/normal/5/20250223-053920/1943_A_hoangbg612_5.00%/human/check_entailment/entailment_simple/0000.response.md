Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself. The array `N` is then sorted to facilitate the optimal play strategy.

2. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, which means Alice will always try to pick the smallest missing integer to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to pick the smallest available integer to minimize the MEX.
   - The program uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the counts of integers that have been processed. The variable `cur` is used to track the current MEX value.

3. **Processing the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks the loop because the MEX has been found.
   - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

4. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - After processing the array, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `cur` and checks if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If this condition is met, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `cur` for each test case, which is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

However, there are a few issues in the logic:
- The variable `S` is not the number of unique integers in the list `N`, but rather the size of the array `N`.
- The condition `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` is incorrect. The sum of the counts in `M` should be the number of elements in `N`, not the size of `N` itself.
- The loop `for i in range(cur)` and the condition `if M[i] <= i` are not necessary. The MEX can be determined directly from the sorted array and the current value of `cur`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players.

Correctness: **False**
