### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to pick elements from the array `a` and construct the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty, and the MEX of `c` is the score.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which is used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number in `N`.

3. **Key Steps in the Program:**
   - **Step 1:** Iterate through the sorted array `N` and update `cur` and `M`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.
   - **Step 2:** Check if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`.
     - If true, increment `cur` by 1.
   - **Step 3:** Collect all keys in `M` that have a count of 1.
   - **Step 4:** If there are at least two such keys, set `cur` to the second smallest key.
   - **Step 5:** Print the final value of `cur`.

4. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - **Sorting and Initial Setup:**
     - The program correctly sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
     - It initializes `cur` to -1 and uses a dictionary `M` to count occurrences, which is a reasonable approach.
   - **MEX Calculation:**
     - The program's logic for updating `cur` and `M` is flawed:
       - The condition `if num > cur + 1:` is used to break the loop, but this does not correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy.
       - The program incorrectly assumes that the second smallest key in `M` with a count of 1 is the final MEX, which is not always true.
       - The program does not consider the optimal strategy for both players, especially Bob's role in minimizing the MEX.
   - **Optimal Strategy:**
     - The correct approach is to simulate the game by alternating turns and keeping track of the numbers picked by both players.
     - Alice should always try to pick the smallest available number that Bob has not picked, and Bob should try to pick the smallest available number that Alice has not picked.
     - The final MEX can be determined by checking the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` after all elements are picked.

5. **Flaws in the Program:**
   - The program does not simulate the game correctly. It only checks the sorted array and updates `cur` based on the first few elements, which does not account for the strategic choices of Alice and Bob.
   - The program's logic for handling the dictionary `M` and the final MEX calculation is incorrect. It does not consider the optimal strategy for both players, especially Bob's role in minimizing the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and has logical flaws in determining the final MEX. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
