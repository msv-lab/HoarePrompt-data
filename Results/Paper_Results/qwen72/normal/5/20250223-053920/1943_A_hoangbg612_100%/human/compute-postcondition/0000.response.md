Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so it might also need to take an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each element in `a` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, and `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. `T` is an input integer.**
