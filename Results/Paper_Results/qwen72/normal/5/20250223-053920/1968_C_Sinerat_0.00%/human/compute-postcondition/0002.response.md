The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `x`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each integer `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `x`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers, each between 1 and 500. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
