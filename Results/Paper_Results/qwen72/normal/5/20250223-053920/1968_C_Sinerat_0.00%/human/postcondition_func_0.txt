The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then constructs a list `a` of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for 1 â‰¤ i < n) is the sum of 500 and the first `i` elements of `x`. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is no longer accessible.
