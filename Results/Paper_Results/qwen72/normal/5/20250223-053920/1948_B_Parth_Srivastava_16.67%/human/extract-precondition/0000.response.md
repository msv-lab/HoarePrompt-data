Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list, where 2 <= n <= 50 and 0 <= a_i <= 99 for all elements a_i in the list.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to correctly reflect the problem:

```python
def can_sort_with_operations(a, n):
```

Precondition: **a is a list of integers of length n, where 2 <= n <= 50 and 0 <= a_i <= 99 for all elements a_i in the list.**
