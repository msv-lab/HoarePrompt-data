### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1()` to process the input and determine if the array can be sorted.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array and a variable `n` to keep track of the length of `c`.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and checks each element:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It then checks if the digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order. Otherwise, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y` and appends them to `c` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After processing the array, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if the transformed list `c` is equal to the sorted list `d`.
   - If `c` is equal to `d`, it appends `1` to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted. Otherwise, it appends `0` to `b`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Issues:
- **Logic for Splitting Elements:**
  - The logic for splitting elements and checking if the array can be sorted is not entirely correct. Specifically, the conditions for appending digits to `c` are too restrictive and may not cover all valid cases.
  - For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will correctly split `12` into `[1, 2]` and `45` into `[4, 5]`, but it will not correctly handle the case where the array is `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will not split `28` because `2` is not greater than or equal to `5`, which is incorrect.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be sorted or where the array contains elements that are not greater than 10 but still need to be checked for sorting.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
