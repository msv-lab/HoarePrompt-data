### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It then reads the input for each test case and processes it using the `func_1` function.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array and a variable `n` to keep track of the length of `c`.

3. **Transforming the Array:**
   - The function iterates over each element in the array `a`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and is not the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if the digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and is the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If the condition is met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c` as is.

4. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After transforming the array, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if the transformed list `c` is equal to the sorted list `d`.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted.
   - Otherwise, it appends `0` to `b`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Transformation Logic:**
  - The logic for transforming the array is flawed. The program only checks if the digits of the current element can be inserted in a specific order, but it does not consider all possible transformations that could make the array sorted.
  - For example, in the test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program does not correctly handle the transformation of `28` to `[2, 8]` and then check if the array can be sorted.

- **Incorrect Condition for First Element:**
  - The condition `if i == 0 and a[i] > 10:` is not necessary and can be simplified. The first element should always be split if it is greater than 10.

- **Redundant Variables:**
  - The variable `n` is not necessary and can be removed since it is always equal to the length of `c`.

- **Incorrect Comparison:**
  - The program should check if the transformed array can be sorted in non-decreasing order, not just if it is equal to the sorted array. This means it should check if the transformed array is already sorted.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the transformation logic and the incorrect condition for the first element, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The transformation logic is too restrictive and does not consider all valid transformations that could make the array sorted.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
