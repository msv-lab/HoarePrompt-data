Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `m` and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called `m` times, once for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, the array `a` is read and processed to create a new list `c`.
   - The function checks if each element in `a` is greater than 10 and, if so, splits it into its digits and appends them to `c` under certain conditions.
   - If the element is not greater than 10, it is directly appended to `c`.

3. **Conditions for Splitting**:
   - If the element is greater than 10 and is not the first element in the array, it is split into its digits `x` and `y` (last and first digits, respectively).
   - The digits are appended to `c` if `y` (the first digit) is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and `y` is less than or equal to `x` (the last digit).
   - If the conditions are not met, the original element is appended to `c`.

4. **Handling the First Element**:
   - If the element is the first in the array and is greater than 10, it is split into its digits `x` and `y`.
   - The digits are appended to `c` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
   - If the conditions are not met, the original element is appended to `c`.

5. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - After processing all elements, the list `c` is sorted.
   - The function checks if the sorted list `c` is equal to the original list `c`.
   - If they are equal, it means the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order, and `1` is appended to the global list `b`.
   - If they are not equal, `0` is appended to `b`.

6. **Output**:
   - After all test cases are processed, the program iterates through the global list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

**Issues**:
- The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the first element in `a` is greater than 10 and the array is empty. This can lead to an index out of range error.
- The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` contains elements that are greater than 10 but the conditions for splitting are not met. For example, if the array is `[12, 28, 5]`, the function will not correctly split `28` because it does not check if the split digits maintain the non-decreasing order relative to the next element in the array.
- The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the array `a` contains elements that are greater than 10 and the conditions for splitting are met, but the resulting list `c` is not sorted. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the function will split `12` into `[1, 2]` but will not correctly handle the subsequent elements to ensure the final list `c` is sorted.

**Correctness**: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and conditions to ensure that the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order. Specifically, it fails to correctly split elements and maintain the non-decreasing order in the resulting list `c`.
