Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `k` and a space-separated list of integers `a` from user input. It processes the list `a` to construct a new list `c` by appending elements from `a` or their digits based on specific conditions. After processing, it sorts the list `c` and appends `1` to a global list `b` if `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it appends `0` to `b`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the global list `b` and constructs the list `c` which is sorted. **
