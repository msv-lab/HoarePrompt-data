The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list. The length of the list `a` is constrained to be between 2 and 50, and each element `a_i` in the list is an integer between 0 and 99, inclusive.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` within the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list, where 2 <= n <= 50 and 0 <= a_i <= 99 for all elements a_i in the list.**
