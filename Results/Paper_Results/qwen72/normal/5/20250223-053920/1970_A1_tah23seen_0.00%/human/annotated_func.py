#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and s is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: ans is an empty string; d is a dictionary where d[n] = 0, and for each index i from 1 to n, d[i] represents the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence at position i.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified in the first element of each tuple in `d`, in the order of the tuples in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which contains the characters from `s` at the indices specified in the first element of each tuple in `d`, in the order of the tuples in `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty, balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` rearranged based on their depth in the balanced parentheses sequence. Specifically, `ans` is constructed by concatenating the characters from `s` in the order of their indices, sorted by the depth of the parentheses at those indices. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a string with the same characters as `s` but ordered by their depth, and `s` remains unchanged.
