### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and returns it.
   - `func_2` reads the values of `n` and `x` for each test case and returns them as a tuple.
   - `func_3` reads the permutation `p` for each test case and returns it as a list of integers.
   - `func_4` and `func_5` are not used in the main program logic and can be ignored for correctness evaluation.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation `p` to find the position `left` where `p[left]` should be equal to `x`.
   - The initial values of `left` and `right` are set to 0 and `n`, respectively.
   - The loop continues until `right - left` is 1.
   - In each iteration, the middle index `mid` is calculated, and the element at `p[mid]` is checked against `x`.
   - If `p[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`, `left` is updated to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `right` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - After the binary search, if `p[left]` is equal to `x`, no swaps are needed, and the program outputs `0`.
   - If `x` is not in the `seen` list, one swap is performed to place `x` at the correct position, and the program outputs `1` followed by the indices of the swap.
   - If `x` is in the `seen` list, two swaps are performed to place `x` at the correct position, and the program outputs `2` followed by the indices of the swaps.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The binary search is correctly implemented, but it is applied to an unsorted permutation, which is not the standard use of binary search.
   - The program attempts to correct the permutation by performing up to 2 swaps before the binary search.
   - The logic for determining the number of swaps and the indices to swap is designed to ensure that `p[left]` will be equal to `x` after the binary search.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position (`p[left] == x`).
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the `seen` list, indicating that it is not in the correct position and needs to be swapped.
   - The case where `x` is in the `seen` list but not in the correct position is handled by performing two swaps to place `x` correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to rearrange the permutation using up to 2 swaps and then perform a binary search to find the position of `x`. The logic for determining the number of swaps and the indices to swap is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
