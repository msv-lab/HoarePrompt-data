### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `nums`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it prints `n` because no operation can be performed if `k` is greater than the number of cards `n`. This is correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the frequency of each number in the list `nums`.
   - It creates a frequency table `frequency_table` where the key is the number and the value is its frequency.
   - If the frequency of any number exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`. This is correct because any frequency greater than `k` can be reduced to `k` by performing the operation multiple times.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After calculating the frequency table, the program checks if any frequency is exactly `k`.
   - If a frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `k - 1` because the operation can be performed to reduce the number of cards by `k` and add `k - 1` new cards. This is correct for the specific case where a frequency is exactly `k`.
   - However, the program does not account for the possibility of reducing the number of cards further by performing the operation multiple times. This is a significant oversight.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output for Some Cases**:
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of cards can be reduced further by performing the operation multiple times.
  - For example, in the fourth test case (`10 4` with all `1`s), the program should output `3` because you can repeatedly exchange 4 cards for 3 new cards until you are left with 3 cards. However, the program will output `10` because it does not account for the reduction in the number of cards after multiple operations.
  - Similarly, in the sixth test case (`6 2` with `10 20 30 10 20 40`), the program should output `1` because you can exchange pairs of cards until you are left with 1 card. However, the program will output `6` because it does not account for the reduction in the number of cards after multiple operations.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the reduction of cards after multiple operations correctly. It only checks for a single operation and does not consider the possibility of further reductions.

### Final: **False**
