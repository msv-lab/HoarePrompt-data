### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to count the frequency of each card number in the list `arr` and cap the frequency at `k`.
   - However, capping the frequency at `k` is incorrect because it does not allow for the proper simulation of the exchange operations. The frequency should be allowed to exceed `k` to accurately determine the number of cards that can be exchanged.

2. **Main Loop Analysis:**
   - The main loop checks if `k` is in the frequency values and prints `k - 1` if it is. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the actual number of cards that can be left after performing the operations.
   - The program should calculate the minimum number of cards left for each card number by considering the frequency modulo `k` and adding 1 if the remainder is non-zero. This ensures that any remaining cards that cannot form a complete set of `k` are counted correctly.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Input:**
     ```
     1
     5 3
     4 1 1 4 4
     ```
     **Expected Output:** `2`
     **Actual Output:** `5`
     - The program incorrectly prints `5` because it does not correctly handle the exchange operations. The correct approach should be to count the frequencies and calculate the minimum cards left.

   - **Input:**
     ```
     1
     10 4
     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
     ```
     **Expected Output:** `3`
     **Actual Output:** `10`
     - The program incorrectly prints `10` because it does not correctly handle the case where all cards have the same number. The correct approach should be to count the frequencies and calculate the minimum cards left.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. For each frequency, calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the exchange operations using the formula `(f % k + (1 if f % k != 0 else 0))`.
3. Sum the minimum number of cards left for all card numbers to get the final result.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums)
        min_cards_left = sum((f % k + (1 if f % k != 0 else 0)) for f in freq.values())
        print(min_cards_left)

def func_1(arr):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases and does not follow the problem description. The corrected program, as suggested in the original assessment, is the correct approach.

Final: **False**
