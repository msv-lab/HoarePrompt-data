The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100, and each integer in `arr` satisfies 1 <= arr[i] <= 100. This ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `num` will be set to the first integer in `arr` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100, and each integer in `arr` satisfies 1 <= arr[i] <= 100, `num` is the first integer in `arr`**
