### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed (since you need at least `k` cards to perform an operation, and you have fewer than `k` cards).

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to create a frequency table of the card numbers in `nums`, capping the frequency at `k`. This is done to ensure that the frequency of any number does not exceed `k`, which is a valid optimization since exchanging `k` cards of the same number will always result in `k-1` new cards.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - After calculating the frequency table, the program checks if any value in the frequency table is exactly `k`. If so, it prints `k-1` because you can perform one operation to reduce the number of cards by 1.
   - If no value in the frequency table is exactly `k`, it prints `n`. This is incorrect because the program should continue to perform operations until no more can be done, and the result should be the minimum number of cards left, not just the initial number of cards.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple operations can be performed. It only checks if there is a single group of `k` cards and then prints `k-1` or `n` without considering further reductions.
- The logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after all possible operations is missing.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple operations can be performed, leading to an incorrect result for some test cases.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
- For the input `5 3` and `4 1 1 4 4`, the program should output `2` because you can perform one operation to exchange the three `4`s for two new cards, leaving you with two cards.
- For the input `10 4` and `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`, the program should output `3` because you can perform two operations to exchange four `1`s for three new cards, and then exchange another four `1`s for three new cards, leaving you with three cards. However, the current program will output `10` because it does not handle multiple operations.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not fully implement the logic required to perform multiple operations and find the minimum number of cards left. 

Correctness: **False**
