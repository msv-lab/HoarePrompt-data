Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Frequency Capping**: The function `func_1` caps the frequency of each card number to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is incorrect because the operation can be performed multiple times on the same number, and the frequency should not be capped in this way.

2. **Incorrect Output Logic**: The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if it is. This logic is flawed because the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations is not necessarily `k - 1`. The correct approach involves calculating the remainder of each frequency when divided by `k` and summing these remainders to get the minimum number of cards left.

3. **No Reduction Logic**: The program does not correctly reduce the number of cards based on the operations. It should consider how many full sets of `k` cards can be removed and what the remainder is.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = {}
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        min_cards_left = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            min_cards_left += count % k
        
        print(min_cards_left)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left by summing the remainders of the frequencies when divided by `k`. This approach ensures that the program handles the problem as described.
