The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` represents the number of coins, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The string `s` has a length equal to `n` and consists of characters "U" and "D", representing the initial states of the coins.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The result for each test case is determined based on the initial states of the coins in the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the test cases, based on the initial states of the coins in the string `s`.**
