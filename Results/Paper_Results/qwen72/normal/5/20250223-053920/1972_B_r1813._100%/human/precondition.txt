The function `main` does not take any direct input parameters, but it is expected to read from standard input a series of test cases. Each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", representing the state of the coins. The number of test cases t is also provided, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
