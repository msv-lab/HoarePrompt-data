The function `func_1` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes a series of test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing "U" and "D" characters. The function prints 'YES' if the count of 'U' characters in `s` is odd, and 'NO' if the count is even. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After the function concludes, the input has been fully processed, and the results for all test cases have been printed. The final state of the program includes the variables `t`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u` holding the values from the last test case processed.
