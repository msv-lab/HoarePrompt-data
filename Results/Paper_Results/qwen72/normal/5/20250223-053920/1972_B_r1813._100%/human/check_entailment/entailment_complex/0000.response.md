Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is generally fine for the given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 100), as the input size is manageable.

2. **Test Case Processing**: The program processes each test case by extracting the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins. This is done correctly by incrementing the index by 2 for each test case.

3. **Winning Condition**: The program determines the winner based on the count of 'U' (facing-up) coins. If the count of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins; if it is even, Bob wins. This logic is based on the observation that each move changes the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Since Alice goes first, if the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, she can always make the number of facing-up coins even after her turn, forcing Bob to make it odd again. This ensures that Alice will always have the last move if the initial count is odd.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Coin**: If there is only one coin, the game ends immediately, and the player whose turn it is loses. The program correctly handles this by checking the count of 'U' coins.
   - **Two Coins**: If there are two coins and both are facing up, the game will end with one coin being removed and the other not being flipped, which means the player whose turn it is loses. The program correctly handles this by checking the count of 'U' coins.

5. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
