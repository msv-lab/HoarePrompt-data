### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd-numbered cards, then the cards that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - We need to determine the k-th card laid down in this process.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `s` to 0 and `m` to 1. `s` keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down, and `m` keeps track of the current multiplier (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues until `n` is reduced to 0.
   - In each iteration, it calculates `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the number of cards that are `m` times an odd number.
   - It then updates `n` to `n // 2`, which effectively removes the cards that are `m` times an odd number from consideration.
   - If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, it means the k-th card is among the cards laid down in this iteration, so the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, it adds `x` to `s` and multiplies `m` by 2 to move to the next set of cards.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Once the loop breaks, the k-th card is calculated as `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - This formula works because `k - s` gives the position of the card within the current set of cards (which are `m` times an odd number), and `(2 * (k - s) - 1)` gives the odd number, which is then multiplied by `m`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 and `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles larger values of `n` and `k` correctly by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems using the loop.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The loop runs in logarithmic time relative to `n` because `n` is halved in each iteration.
   - The overall complexity is efficient enough to handle the constraints given in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. It handles the problem efficiently and correctly for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
