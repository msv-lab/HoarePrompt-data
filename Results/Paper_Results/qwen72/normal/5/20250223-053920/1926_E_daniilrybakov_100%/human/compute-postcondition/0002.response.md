Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `n` and `k` from the input, perform a series of calculations, and print the result of `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`. The variables `s` and `m` will be reset to 0 and 1, respectively, at the beginning of each iteration. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` will be undefined or reset for the next test case, but the number of test cases `t` will remain as specified in the initial state.**
