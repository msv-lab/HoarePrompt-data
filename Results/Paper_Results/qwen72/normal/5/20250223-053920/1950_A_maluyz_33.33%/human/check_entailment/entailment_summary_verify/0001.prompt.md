You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user. Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'NONE' in all other cases. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Stair Condition:**
   - The function checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - This condition correctly identifies a sequence where the digits are in strictly increasing order.

3. **Equal Digits Condition:**
   - The function checks if `a == b == c`. If this condition is true, it prints "NONE".
   - This condition correctly identifies a sequence where all three digits are the same, which does not form a stair or a peak.

4. **Peak Condition:**
   - The function checks if `max(a, b, c) == b`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - This condition correctly identifies a sequence where `b` is the maximum digit, which means `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. This is a valid peak condition.

5. **None Condition:**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints "NONE".
   - This condition correctly handles all other cases where the digits do not form a stair or a peak.

### Analysis:
- The conditions are mutually exclusive and cover all possible cases:
  - `a < b < c` for a stair.
  - `a == b == c` for equal digits.
  - `max(a, b, c) == b` for a peak.
  - All other cases are handled by the "NONE" condition.
- The logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.
