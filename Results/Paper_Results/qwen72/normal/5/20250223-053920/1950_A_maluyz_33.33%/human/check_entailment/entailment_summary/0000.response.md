Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. Each test case consists of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are read and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met. This is the correct condition for a stair.

3. **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `b` is the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. This is the correct condition for a peak, as it ensures that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

4. **None Condition**: The program prints 'NONE' if neither the stair nor the peak condition is met. This is correct because it covers all other cases, including when `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should output 'NONE'.

6. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, as specified in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
