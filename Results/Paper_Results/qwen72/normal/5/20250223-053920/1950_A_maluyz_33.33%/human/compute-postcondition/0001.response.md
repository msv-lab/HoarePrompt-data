The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `i` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range(t)` function. However, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
