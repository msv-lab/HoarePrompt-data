You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.

    #State: For each test case, the variable `num` will hold the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big` and less than the minimum value in `less`, and is not in the list `no`. If no such integer exists, `num` will be 0. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will be empty after each test case. The variable `iterable` will have the value `loop - 1` after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`loop`) and the number of constraints for each test case (`innerLoop`).
   - It then reads each constraint and categorizes them into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), `less` for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to x).

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - The program calculates the maximum value from the `big` list, which represents the smallest possible value for `k` that satisfies all "greater than or equal to" constraints.
   - The program calculates the minimum value from the `less` list, which represents the largest possible value for `k` that satisfies all "less than or equal to" constraints.
   - The program then iterates over the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` to find the first integer `i` that is not in the `no` list. This is intended to find the first valid `k` that satisfies all constraints.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the first valid `k` it finds. However, this is incorrect because the problem requires the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, not just the first valid `k`.

4. **Logical Error**:
   - The program only finds and prints the first valid `k` and does not count all valid `k` values.
   - The correct approach would be to count all integers in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that are not in the `no` list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` is empty (i.e., `max(big) > min(less)`), which should result in an output of 0.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the range is valid but all values in the range are in the `no` list, which should also result in an output of 0.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly count the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It only finds the first valid `k` and prints it, which is not what the problem requires. The program needs to be modified to count all valid `k` values in the specified range.
