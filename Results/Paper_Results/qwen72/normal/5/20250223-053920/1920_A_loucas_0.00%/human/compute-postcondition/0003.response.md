The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with the following inputs: an integer `t` within the range 1 to 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` within the range 2 to 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair `(a, x)`, where `a` is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and `x` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^9. It is guaranteed that each test case contains at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

The function returns a result based on the constraints provided for each test case, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the general functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. It returns a result for each test case based on the constraints provided, ensuring that each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.**
