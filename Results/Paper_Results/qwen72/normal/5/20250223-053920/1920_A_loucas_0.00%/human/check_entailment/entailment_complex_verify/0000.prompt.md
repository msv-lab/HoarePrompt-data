You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.

    #State: For each test case, the variable `num` will hold the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big` and less than the minimum value in `less`, and is not in the list `no`. If no such integer exists, `num` will be 0. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will be empty after each test case. The variable `iterable` will have the value `loop - 1` after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by a set of constraints. Each constraint is a pair (a, x), where `a` indicates the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and `x` is an integer. The function finds and prints the smallest integer `num` for each test case that meets the following criteria: it is greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list of type 1 constraints (`big`), less than the minimum value in the list of type 2 constraints (`less`), and not present in the list of type 3 constraints (`no`). If no such integer exists, `num` is set to 0. After processing each test case, the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are reset to empty. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of integers that satisfy all the constraints. Instead, it only finds the first integer that satisfies the constraints and prints it, which is not the required output. The problem description requires the program to output the number of integers that satisfy all constraints, not just the first one.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
The correct output should be `7` because the integers `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10` satisfy all the constraints. However, the provided program will output `3` because it stops after finding the first valid integer and does not count all valid integers.
