The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4 and 1 <= k <= floor(n/2). `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function returns a list of results for each test case. For each test case, if the function can find a subsequence of length `k` such that each element in the subsequence is unique, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. It returns a list of results for each test case, where each result is "Yes" if a subsequence of length `k` with unique elements can be found in `a`, and "No" otherwise.**
