### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the array.
   - It then reads a line of space-separated integers and splits it into a list `na`.
   - The list `na` is then appended to the list `a`, which is supposed to store the array elements. However, the elements are stored as strings, not integers. This is a significant issue because the MEX calculation and array manipulation require integer values.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is correct in terms of passing the length of the array.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as an argument, which is the length of the array.
   - The function only handles two specific cases:
     - If `c` (the length of the array) is 2, it prints the output `4 1` and `1 2`, which corresponds to the first example in the problem description.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints the output `13 0`, which corresponds to the second example in the problem description.
   - The function returns `None` without performing any further operations.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Output for General Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` only handles the specific cases where the length of the array is 2 or not 2. This is not a general solution to the problem.
   - For arrays of length 3 or more, the function always outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect for most inputs. For example, in the third example, the correct output should be `105 2` with the operations `3 3` and `3 4`.

2. **No MEX Calculation:**
   - The function does not calculate the MEX of any subarray, which is a crucial part of the problem.
   - The function does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

3. **No Handling of Different Array Lengths:**
   - The function does not handle different lengths of the array or different values of the array elements.
   - It does not provide a sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum for arrays of any length.

4. **Type Conversion:**
   - The elements of the array `a` are stored as strings, not integers. This will cause issues when trying to perform arithmetic or logical operations on them.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem for all valid inputs. It only handles specific cases and does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. Additionally, the type conversion issue will prevent the program from functioning correctly even for the specific cases it attempts to handle.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
