Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. The program only checks if the length of the array is 2 and outputs a fixed result for that case. For all other lengths, it outputs a fixed result of `13 0`, which is not a general solution to the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the program will output:
```
13 0
```
This is clearly incorrect because the program does not compute the MEX for any subarray or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. The program's logic is too simplistic and does not align with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

Final: **False**
