Reasoning:

The program provided is incorrect for the problem at hand. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input but does not convert the elements of the array `a` to integers. This can lead to incorrect operations when the elements are treated as strings instead of integers.

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `a` as an argument, but it does not actually use the array `a` within the function. Instead, it only checks the length of the input and prints a fixed output based on whether the length is 2 or not. This is not a general solution and will fail for most inputs.

3. **Output**: The function prints a fixed output of either `4 1` followed by `1 2` if the length of the array is 2, or `13 0` if the length is anything else. This does not consider the actual values in the array and does not attempt to compute the MEX or maximize the sum of the array elements.

4. **Algorithm**: The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to find the MEX of subarrays and update the array elements accordingly to maximize the sum. The provided function does not implement any such logic.

Given these issues, the program does not solve the problem as described and will produce incorrect results for most inputs.

Correctness: **False**
