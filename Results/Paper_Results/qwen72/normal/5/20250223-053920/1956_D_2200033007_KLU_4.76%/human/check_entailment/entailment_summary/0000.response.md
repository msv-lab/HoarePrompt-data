Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not handle the problem as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as an argument, which is the length of the array `a`, but it does not use the array `a` itself to determine the MEX and perform the operations.
2. The function only checks if the length of the array is 2 and prints a fixed output "4 1" followed by "1 2". This is incorrect because the output should depend on the actual values in the array, not just its length.
3. For all other lengths, the function prints "13 0", which is also incorrect because the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve it should be calculated based on the array's contents, not a fixed value.
4. The function does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as required by the problem statement.
5. The function does not compute the MEX of any subarray, nor does it update the array elements based on the MEX.

Given these issues, the program does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
