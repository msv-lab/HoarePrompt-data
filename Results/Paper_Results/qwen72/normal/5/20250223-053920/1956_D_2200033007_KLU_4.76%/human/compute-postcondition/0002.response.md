The provided code snippet is:
```
print(f'4 1')
```

Let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
   - Each element \(c_i\) in the list `c` satisfies \(0 \leq c_i \leq 10^7\).
   - `m` is 0.
   - The current value of `c` is 2.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is using an f-string to print the literal string `'4 1'`.
   - The f-string does not contain any variables or expressions that need to be evaluated.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - Since the f-string is a literal string, it will print exactly what is written inside it.
   - The values of `c`, `m`, and the elements of `c` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **4 1**
