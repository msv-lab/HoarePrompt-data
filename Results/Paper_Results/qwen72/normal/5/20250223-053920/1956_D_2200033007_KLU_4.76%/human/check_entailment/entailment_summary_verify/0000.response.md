### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function Summary Inaccuracy**:
   - The function summary provided is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not accept a list `c` of integers; instead, it accepts an integer `c` which is the length of the array `a`.
   - The function `func_1` only handles the case where the length of the array `a` is 2 or not 2, and it outputs a fixed result for these cases. This is clearly not a general solution.

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program reads the input array `a` and then calls `func_1` with the length of `a`.
   - Inside `func_1`, if the length `c` is 2, it prints "4 1" and "1 2".
   - If the length `c` is not 2, it prints "13 0".
   - This behavior is incorrect because it does not consider the actual values in the array `a` and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum of the elements.

3. **Specific Example**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     4
     1 100 2 1
     ```
     The correct output should be:
     ```
     105 2
     3 3
     3 4
     ```
     However, the provided program will output:
     ```
     13 0
     ```
     This is clearly incorrect because it does not maximize the sum of the elements of the array.

4. **General Solution Requirement**:
   - The problem requires a solution that can handle any array of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 18`) and maximize the sum of the elements by performing the specified operations.
   - The provided program does not implement the logic to compute the MEX of a subarray and apply the operations to maximize the sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case of the problem and only outputs fixed results based on the length of the array, without considering the actual values in the array or performing the required operations to maximize the sum.
