### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the array.
   - It then reads a line of space-separated integers and splits it into a list `na`.
   - The list `na` is then appended to the list `a`, which is supposed to store the array elements. However, the elements are appended as strings, not integers. This is a critical error because the subsequent operations require integer values.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is correct in terms of passing the length of the array.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as an argument, which is the length of the array.
   - If `c` (the length of the array) is 2, it prints the output `4 1` and `1 2`, which corresponds to the first example in the problem description. This is correct for the specific case where the array has exactly two elements.
   - If `c` is not 2, it prints the output `13 0`, which corresponds to the second example in the problem description. However, this is incorrect for most inputs. For example, in the third example, the correct output should be `105 2` with the operations `3 3` and `3 4`.

4. **General Case Handling:**
   - The function does not handle different lengths of the array or different values of the array elements. It only prints a fixed output for arrays of length 2 and a different fixed output for arrays of other lengths.
   - The function does not calculate the MEX of any subarray, which is a crucial part of the problem.
   - The function does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

5. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - However, the annotations do not address the fact that the elements of the array `a` are strings, not integers, which is a significant issue.
   - The annotations also do not challenge the fixed outputs for different array lengths, which are incorrect for most inputs.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem for all valid inputs. It only handles specific cases and does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. Additionally, the program incorrectly appends the array elements as strings instead of integers, which would cause issues in any further processing.

### Correctness:
**False**
