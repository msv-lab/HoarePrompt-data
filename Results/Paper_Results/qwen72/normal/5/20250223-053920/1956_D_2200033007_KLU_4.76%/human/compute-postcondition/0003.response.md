Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 18\).
   - Each element \(c_i\) in the list `c` satisfies \(0 \leq c_i \leq 10^7\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
   - `m` is 0.
   - The current value of `c` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'1 2')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is a formatted string that explicitly prints the values `1` and `2`.
   - The values `1` and `2` are hardcoded in the string and do not depend on any variables or objects from the initial state.

4. **Output**:
   - Since the `print` statement is simply printing the string `'1 2'`, the output will be exactly `1 2`.

Output: **1 2**
