The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates within a context where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return values are not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function operates within a context where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific return values are not described.**
