Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program then checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`). If neither condition is met, it outputs "NONE". The program handles all the specified cases and outputs the correct results based on the given conditions.

The execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, reading the inputs and printing the appropriate outputs for each test case. There are no issues with the logic or the handling of inputs and outputs.

Correctness: **True**
