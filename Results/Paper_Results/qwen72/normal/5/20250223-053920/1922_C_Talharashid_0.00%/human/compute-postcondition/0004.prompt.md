You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the m queries, x_i and y_i are integers where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the cumulative minimum differences for each index when traversing the list `lst` from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively. For each of the `m` queries, the minimum of the two possible cumulative differences (one from `d1` and one from `d2`) is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each with an integer `n`, a list of `n` strictly increasing integers `a`, and `m` queries. For each query, it returns a result based on the elements of `a` specified by the query. The function processes up to 10^4 test cases, with each test case containing up to 10^5 elements in `a` and up to 10^5 queries, ensuring the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
