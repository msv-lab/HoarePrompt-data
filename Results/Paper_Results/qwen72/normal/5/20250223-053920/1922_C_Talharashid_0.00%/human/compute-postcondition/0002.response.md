Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the cumulative minimum differences for each index when traversing the list `lst` from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively. For each of the `m` queries, the minimum of the two possible cumulative differences (one from `d1` and one from `d2`) is printed.**
