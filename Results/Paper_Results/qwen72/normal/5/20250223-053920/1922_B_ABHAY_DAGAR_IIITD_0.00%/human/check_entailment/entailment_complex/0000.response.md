### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent in `num_list`. This is a correct approach to keep track of the number of sticks of each length.

3. **Triangle Formation Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to form triangles using the sticks. The key insight here is that for three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
   - Given that the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because \(2^a + 2^a > 2^a\) and \(2^a + 2^b \leq 2^b\) for \(a < b\).

4. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} \), which is \( \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
   - It also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count \), which is \( \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times total_count \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case after all calculations are done.

### Correctness:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly handles the input, counts the occurrences of each stick length, and calculates the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles based on the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
