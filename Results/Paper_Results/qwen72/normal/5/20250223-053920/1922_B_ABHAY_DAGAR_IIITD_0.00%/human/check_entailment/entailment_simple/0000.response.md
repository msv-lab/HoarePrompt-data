### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent in `num_list`. This is a valid and efficient way to count the frequencies of each stick length.

3. **Triangle Formation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using the sticks.
   - For each unique exponent `x` with count `cnt`:
     - If `cnt >= 3`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \cdot (cnt - 1) \cdot (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
     - If `cnt >= 2`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \cdot total_count = \frac{cnt \cdot (cnt - 1)}{2} \cdot total_count \).
     - It updates `total_count` with the count of the current exponent.

4. **Output**:
   - The program stores the result for each test case in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Combination Formulas**:
  - The combination formulas used are correct for counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length and 2 sticks of the same length with one different stick.
  - The formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \cdot (cnt - 1) \cdot (cnt - 2)}{6} \) correctly counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `cnt` sticks.
  - The formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \cdot total_count = \frac{cnt \cdot (cnt - 1)}{2} \cdot total_count \) correctly counts the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `cnt` sticks and one stick from the previously counted sticks.

- **Triangle Inequality**:
  - The program implicitly handles the triangle inequality by only considering combinations where the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. This is because the lengths are powers of 2, and the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle with powers of 2 is if the three lengths are the same or two are the same and one is different.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n < 3` by not adding any combinations to the result.
  - It also correctly handles the case where all sticks are of different lengths, resulting in 0 ways to form a triangle.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically correct and handles the problem as described. It correctly counts the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles using the given sticks and prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
