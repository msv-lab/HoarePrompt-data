You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: Output State: `t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 10^4, `inf` remains 200001, `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for 1 ≤ i < 200001) is the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: `t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 10^4, `inf` remains 200001, `values` remains the same list where each element at index `i` (for 1 ≤ i < 200001) is the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `n` (the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case). For each test case, it returns a result based on the value of `n`.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
