#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, b is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, and each element in a and b is an integer where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(a, b, k, n, m):
    good_subarrays = 0
    b_freq = Counter(b)
    window_freq = Counter(a[:m])
    matches = sum(min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in
    b_freq)
    for i in range(n - m):
        if matches >= k:
            good_subarrays += 1
        
        if a[i] in b_freq:
            matches -= min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])
        
        window_freq[a[i]] -= 1
        
        if window_freq[a[i]] == 0:
            del window_freq[a[i]]
        
        if a[i + m] in b_freq:
            matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])

    #State: `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `good_subarrays` is the number of subarrays of length m in `a` that have at least `k` elements matching the frequency in `b`, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the last m elements of `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq` for integers that are present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.
    if (matches >= k) :
        good_subarrays += 1
    #State: *`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the last m elements of `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq` for integers that are present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains unchanged.
    return good_subarrays
    #The program returns the value of `good_subarrays`, which is the count of subarrays in `a` of length `m` that contain at least `k` integers with frequencies matching those in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `b` of `m` integers, and an integer `k`, where `1 <= k <= m`. It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` elements whose frequencies match or are less than the frequencies of the corresponding elements in `b`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` or `b`. After the function concludes, the input parameters remain unchanged, and the return value is the number of such "good" subarrays.
