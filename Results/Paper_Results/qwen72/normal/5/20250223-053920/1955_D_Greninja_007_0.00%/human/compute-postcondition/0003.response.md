Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `good_subarrays` is 0, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq` for integers that are present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.**
