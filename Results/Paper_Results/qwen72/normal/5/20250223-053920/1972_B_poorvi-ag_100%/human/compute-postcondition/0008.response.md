Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "U" and "D". It then checks if the count of 'U' in the string `s` is odd. If it is, the function appends 'yes' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in the results list, which contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the condition. The function does not return any value. **
