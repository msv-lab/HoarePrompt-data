The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained to be between 1 and 100 inclusive. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "U" and "D", representing the state of the coins.

The function returns the number of flips required to make all coins face up ("U") for each test case. If the input is invalid (e.g., `t` is out of bounds, or the tuples do not meet the constraints), the function may return an error or an invalid result.
