Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list.**

The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer and there is a list of tuples representing the test cases. The code initializes an empty list `results`. The value of `t` and the list of tuples remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes `t` as an input integer and `results` as an empty list.
