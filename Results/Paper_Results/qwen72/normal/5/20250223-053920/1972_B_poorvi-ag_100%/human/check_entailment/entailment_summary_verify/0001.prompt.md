You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "U" and "D". It then checks if the count of 'U' in the string `s` is odd. If it is, the function appends 'yes' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in the results list, which contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the condition. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a circle of coins, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when no facing-up coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
   - We need to determine if Alice (the first player) will win if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The game is symmetric in the sense that the number of facing-up coins is crucial.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice.
   - This pattern continues until one player is left with no facing-up coins to remove.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd at the start, Alice will always be able to make the last move, ensuring Bob loses.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even at the start, Bob will always be able to make the last move, ensuring Alice loses.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It counts the number of 'U' (facing-up coins) in the string `arr`.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list, indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count of 'U' is even, it appends 'no' to the results list, indicating Bob wins.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the winning player based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The logic is consistent with the optimal play strategy described above.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for determining the winner of the game.
