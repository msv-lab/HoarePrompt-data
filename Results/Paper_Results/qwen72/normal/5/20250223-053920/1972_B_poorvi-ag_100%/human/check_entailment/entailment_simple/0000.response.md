### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves a circle of coins, each of which can be either "U" (up) or "D" (down).
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when no facing-up coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The goal is to determine if Alice (the first player) will win if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move when it is her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he will eventually lose.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the state of the coins `arr`.
   - It then checks if the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, it appends 'yes' to the `results` list, indicating Alice will win.
   - If the count is even, it appends 'no' to the `results` list, indicating Alice will lose.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The logic is sound and aligns with the game's rules and the optimal play strategy.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
