Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of a binary string `s`, and then reads the binary string `s`. The function calculates the optimal position `i` to split the string `s` such that the number of zeros on the left side and the number of ones on the right side are as close as possible to the required counts, ensuring at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. It prints the optimal position `i` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables used within the function are reset for each test case, making their final values undefined. **
