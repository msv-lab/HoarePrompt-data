Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty for splitting a string `s` into non-empty arrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` where each `b_i` is a subarray of `a` and the penalty is calculated as described. However, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to achieve this goal.

1. **Balance Calculation and Penalty Logic**: The function `func_1` calculates a balance by iterating through the string `expression` and adjusting the balance based on whether the character is `+` or `-`. It increments a `count` each time the balance goes below 0 and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it adds 1 to the count if the balance is greater than 0 at the end of the iteration.

2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The penalty calculation logic in the function is flawed. The problem requires the penalty to be the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The function `func_1` does not calculate the penalty for each subarray; instead, it counts the number of times the balance goes below 0 and adds 1 if the final balance is positive. This does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.

3. **Optimal Splitting**: The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to split it such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible. This can be achieved by splitting the array at points where the cumulative sum of the array elements (1 for `+` and -1 for `-`) is zero or as close to zero as possible. The provided function does not implement this optimal splitting logic.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input `+`, the correct output is `1` because the only subarray is `[1]` and its penalty is `1`.
   - For the input `-----`, the correct output is `5` because the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])` and the total penalty is `5`.
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the correct output is `0` because the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1])` and the total penalty is `0`.
   - For the input `--+++++++`, the correct output is `4` because the optimal split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])` and the total penalty is `4`.
   - For the input `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the correct output is `4` because the optimal split is `([1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1])` and the total penalty is `4`.

The provided function does not correctly handle the splitting and penalty calculation as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
