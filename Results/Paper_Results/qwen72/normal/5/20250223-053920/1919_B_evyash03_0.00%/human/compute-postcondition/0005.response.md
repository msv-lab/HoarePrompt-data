The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression` and `length`. `expression` is a string of length `length`, where `length` is a positive integer (1 ≤ length ≤ 5000), and `expression` consists only of the characters "+" and "-". The function returns the number of times the `balance` went below 0 during the iteration of the loop, plus 1 if the final `balance` is greater than 0. Otherwise, it returns the number of times the `balance` went below 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` of length `length`, where `length` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, and `expression` consists only of "+" and "-" characters. It returns the number of times the balance went below 0 during the iteration, plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0. If the final balance is not greater than 0, it returns only the number of times the balance went below 0.**
