### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Splitting the String**:
   - The program splits the string `s` by the character `-` to get parts that contain only `+` characters. This step is not necessary for the correct solution, as it does not help in calculating the minimum penalty.

3. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - The program initializes `count` and `balance` to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is `+`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
     - If the character is `-`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
     - If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` by 1 and resets the `balance` to zero.
   - After the loop, it adds 1 to the `count` if the `balance` is greater than zero.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- The goal is to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of the penalties of the subarrays.
- The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- To minimize the penalty, we should try to split the array in such a way that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.

### Issues with the Program:

- **Splitting the String**:
  - The `parts` variable is created by splitting the string `s` by `-`, but it is not used in the calculation of the penalty. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

- **Balance Calculation**:
  - The `balance` variable is used to keep track of the cumulative sum of the array elements.
  - If the `balance` becomes negative, the program increments the `count` and resets the `balance` to zero. This is a valid approach to ensure that the penalty is minimized by splitting the array at points where the sum becomes negative.
  - However, the final return statement `return count + (balance > 0)` is incorrect. If the `balance` is positive at the end, it means there are more `+` characters than `-` characters, and the penalty should be the length of the remaining subarray, not just 1.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly calculate the minimum penalty, we need to ensure that the penalty is calculated based on the length of the subarrays where the sum is non-zero. The correct approach is to split the array at points where the sum becomes zero or negative, and then calculate the penalty for each subarray.

### Corrected Program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(min_penalty(expression))

def min_penalty(expression):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        if balance == 0:
            count += 1
    return count * 2 - 1 if balance == 0 else abs(balance) * length
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **min_penalty Function**:
  - Initialize `count` to zero and `balance` to zero.
  - Iterate through each character in the string `expression`:
    - Increment `balance` by 1 for `+` and decrement by 1 for `-`.
    - If `balance` becomes zero, increment `count` by 1.
  - After the loop, if `balance` is zero, the penalty is `count * 2 - 1` (since each zero-sum subarray contributes a penalty of 0, and the last subarray contributes a penalty of 1).
  - If `balance` is non-zero, the penalty is `abs(balance) * length`.

### Final Correctness:

- The original program does not correctly handle the case where the `balance` is positive at the end.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the minimum penalty by splitting the array at points where the sum is zero or negative and then calculating the penalty based on the remaining balance.

Correctness: **False**
