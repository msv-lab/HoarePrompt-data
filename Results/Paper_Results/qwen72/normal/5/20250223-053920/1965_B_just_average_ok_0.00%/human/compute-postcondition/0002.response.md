The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is clear that the function should accept two parameters: `n` and `k`. Additionally, it is implied that the function might handle multiple test cases, indicated by the parameter `t`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.

The function's output is not specified in the provided text, so we need to infer based on common programming practices and the given constraints. Typically, such a function would return a result for each test case, likely based on some computation involving `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The function returns a result for each test case, though the specific nature of the result is not provided in the constraints.**
