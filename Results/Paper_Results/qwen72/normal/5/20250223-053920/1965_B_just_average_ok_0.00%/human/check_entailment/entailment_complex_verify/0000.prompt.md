You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]

        print(*nums)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the modified `nums` list. The `nums` list initially contains powers of 2 from 1 to \(2^{23}\). After the loop, it contains the same elements as before, but with the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) removed and three new elements appended: \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\). The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` are re-assigned for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. The function modifies a list `nums` that initially contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). After processing each test case, the list `nums` is updated by removing the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) (where \(\text{idx}\) is the largest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\)) and appending three new elements: \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\). The function then prints the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the list. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` are re-assigned for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for constructing the sequence `nums` may fail to ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of `k` while also ensuring that all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) have a subsequence that sums to them.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 3
```

The program constructs the sequence as follows:
1. `nums = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`
2. `idx = 1` (since `3 >= 2` and `3 < 4`)
3. `nums.append(3 - 2) = nums.append(1)`
4. `nums.append(3 + 1) = nums.append(4)`
5. `nums.append(3 + 2 + 1) = nums.append(6)`
6. `nums.remove(2)`

The resulting sequence is:
```
[1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 1, 4, 6]
```

However, this sequence does not meet the requirements:
- The sequence contains `1` twice, which means there are multiple subsequences that sum to 1.
- The sequence does not contain a subsequence that sums to 2, which is required since `2` is between 1 and 5 and `2` is not equal to `3`.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this input.
