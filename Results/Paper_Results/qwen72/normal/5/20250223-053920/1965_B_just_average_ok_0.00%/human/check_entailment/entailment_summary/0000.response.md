Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The list `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). This ensures that `nums` contains 24 elements, which is within the allowed size of 25.

2. **Finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`**:
   - The variable `idx` is used to find the largest index such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\). This is done by incrementing `idx` until \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) and then decrementing `idx` by 1.

3. **Modifying the list `nums`**:
   - The element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from `nums`.
   - Three new elements are appended to `nums`: \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\).

4. **Ensuring no subsequence sums to `k`**:
   - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and appending \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), the sum \(k\) cannot be formed because the only way to form \(k\) using the original elements would have been to use \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and some other elements. Removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) breaks this possibility.
   - The elements \(k + 1\) and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) are added to ensure that all other sums \(v\) (where \(1 \le v \le n\) and \(v \ne k\)) can still be formed. These elements are chosen to cover the gaps created by the removal of \(2^{\text{idx}}\).

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the modified `nums` list, which is always 25 (since 24 elements are initially present and 3 are added while 1 is removed).
   - It then prints the elements of the modified `nums` list.

6. **Constraints and Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the constraints \(2 \le n \le 10^6\) and \(1 \le k \le n\) correctly.
   - The function ensures that the sequence `nums` is of size at most 25 and contains non-negative integers.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums \(v\) (where \(1 \le v \le n\) and \(v \ne k\)) to be formed.

Correctness: **True**
