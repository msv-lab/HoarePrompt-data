You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. The function modifies a list `nums` that initially contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). After processing each test case, the list `nums` is updated by removing the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) (where \(\text{idx}\) is the largest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\)) and appending three new elements: \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\). The function then prints the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the list. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` are re-assigned for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction:**
   - The program starts by creating a sequence `nums` of powers of 2 up to `2^23` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`).
   - This sequence has the property that any number in the range `[1, 2^24 - 1]` can be represented as a sum of a subsequence of these numbers (since they are the binary digits).

3. **Adjusting the Sequence:**
   - The program then finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the sequence.
   - It appends three new numbers to the sequence: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The idea is to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while still allowing all other sums in the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Verification:**
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
     - By removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, the program ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence of the remaining numbers.
     - The new numbers added are designed to avoid forming `k` while still covering all other sums.
   - **All Other Sums in Range `[1, n]`:**
     - The sequence still contains all powers of 2 up to `2^23` except for the one removed.
     - The added numbers `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` help in forming all other sums in the range `[1, n]` that are not equal to `k`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is a power of 2 by removing the exact power of 2 and adding the necessary numbers to ensure all other sums are possible.
   - The program also ensures that the sequence size does not exceed 25, which is within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while still allowing all other sums in the range `[1, n]`.
