Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `l` is the last input integer, `s` is the last calculated value and printed. For each of the `t` testcases, there are four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` such that -1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**
