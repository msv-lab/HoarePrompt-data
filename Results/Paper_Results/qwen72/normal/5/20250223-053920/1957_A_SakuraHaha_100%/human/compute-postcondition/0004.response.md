The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. The variable `x` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the number of sticks and their lengths respectively, such that 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100. `ans` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**
