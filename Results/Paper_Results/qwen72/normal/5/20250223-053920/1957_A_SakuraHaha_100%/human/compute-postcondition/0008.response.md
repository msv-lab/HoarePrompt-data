To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `test_cases` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a`, `n`, `t`, and `test_cases` are mentioned but not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore them for this task.
   - `cnt` is a list of values, but the exact values are not provided in the initial state.
   - `ans` is calculated as the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - The integer division of a value `x` by 3 is denoted as `x // 3`.
   - `ans` is the sum of these integer divisions for all elements in `cnt`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `cnt` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
   - However, we can describe `ans` based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the integer division of each value in the list `cnt` by 3)**
