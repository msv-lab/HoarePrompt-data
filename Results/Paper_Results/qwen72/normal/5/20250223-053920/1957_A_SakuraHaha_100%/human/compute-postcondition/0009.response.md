The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, where `n` represents the number of sticks and `a` represents the lengths of these sticks. The constraints are 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines whether it is possible to form a non-degenerate triangle using any three of the sticks provided in the list `a`. If it is possible, the function returns "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the number of sticks and their lengths, respectively). The function returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if a non-degenerate triangle can be formed using any three sticks from the list `a` for that test case, and "No" otherwise.**
