#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the number of sticks and their lengths respectively, such that 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `ans` remains 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` remains unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - Since the exact values of `cnt` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
    #   - However, we can describe `ans` based on the given information.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and calculates the number of groups of three identical sticks that can be formed. The result, `ans`, is printed to the console. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that `a` and `n` remain unchanged, while `ans` contains the calculated number of groups.
