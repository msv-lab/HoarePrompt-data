Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is designed to solve the card game problem by calculating the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally. The function `func_1` counts how many numbers in your hand appear exactly twice, which is a key part of the strategy because if you have a pair of a number, you can score a point for that number when you play the second card, assuming Nene doesn't play her matching card before you.

However, the program does not fully account for Nene's optimal play. Specifically, Nene will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours. If you have a pair of a number, Nene will play her matching card as soon as possible to prevent you from scoring a point. Therefore, the correct approach is to count the numbers that you have only once and Nene has the second card, as you can only score points for these numbers.

The current implementation of `func_1` only counts the numbers that appear exactly twice in your hand, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum score you can get. It should also consider the numbers that appear once in your hand and are not in Nene's hand (or are played by Nene after you play your first card).

Given this, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It fails to account for the strategic play of Nene and the dynamic nature of the game where the state of the table changes with each turn.

Correctness: **False**
