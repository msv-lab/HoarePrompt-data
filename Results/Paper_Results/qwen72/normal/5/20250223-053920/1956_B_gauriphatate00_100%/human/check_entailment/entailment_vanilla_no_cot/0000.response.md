Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the game's logic, especially the optimal play strategy for Nene. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of integers in your hand that appear twice and assumes that you can always score a point for each of these integers. However, this does not consider Nene's optimal play strategy, which can prevent you from scoring points in certain scenarios.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the following:
1. **Optimal Play for You**: You should try to score points by playing cards that have a matching card on the table.
2. **Optimal Play for Nene**: Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. If you have a card that matches a card on the table, Nene will avoid playing the matching card if she has it, to prevent you from scoring.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(a, n)
    results.append(result)
for res in results:
    print(res)

def func_1(a, n):
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
    
    # Calculate the number of unique cards in your hand
    unique_cards = set(a)
    
    # Calculate the number of cards that appear exactly once in your hand
    single_cards = sum(1 for num in unique_cards if count_a[num] == 1)
    
    # Calculate the number of cards that appear exactly twice in your hand
    double_cards = sum(1 for num in unique_cards if count_a[num] == 2)
    
    # If you have more single cards than double cards, Nene can prevent you from scoring on all double cards
    if single_cards >= double_cards:
        return 0
    
    # Otherwise, you can score points for the excess double cards
    return double_cards - single_cards
```

### Explanation:
1. **Counting Cards**: The program first counts the occurrences of each card in your hand.
2. **Unique Cards**: It then identifies the unique cards in your hand.
3. **Single and Double Cards**: It calculates the number of cards that appear exactly once and exactly twice in your hand.
4. **Optimal Play**: If the number of single cards is greater than or equal to the number of double cards, Nene can prevent you from scoring any points by playing the matching cards to the table. Otherwise, you can score points for the excess double cards that Nene cannot prevent.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles the game's logic and provides the maximum number of points you can score given Nene's optimal play.
