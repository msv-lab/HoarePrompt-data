### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - If it is impossible to construct such an array, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` to \( 10^8 \) and `min` to \(-10^8 \).
   - It creates an empty list `ans` to store the array elements.
   - It uses a loop to reduce \( X \) to 1 by either appending `max` and decrementing `max` if \( X \) is even, or appending `min` and incrementing `min` if \( X \) is odd.
   - After the loop, it prints the length of the array `t` and the array `ans` in reverse order.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( X \) is reduced to 1 by appending elements to the array.
   - The use of `max` and `min` ensures that the elements are within the valid range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - The program appends `max` when \( X \) is even and `min` when \( X \) is odd. This ensures that the array can be constructed to have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array is printed in reverse order to maintain the correct sequence of elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1. However, the problem description specifies that \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \), so this is not a concern.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the length of the array exceeds 200. However, given the constraints and the way the program constructs the array, it is highly unlikely to exceed 200 elements. The maximum number of operations required to reduce \( X \) to 1 is \( \log_2(X) \), which is at most 60 for \( X \le 10^{18} \). Therefore, the length of the array will not exceed 200.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, which matches the required output format.

6. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves a positive integer \( X \) (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).
   - For each \( X \), it generates and prints an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - It prints the number of elements in the array.
   - The function does not return any value.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and problem description. It constructs an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences and ensures that the elements are within the valid range. The logic is sound, and the edge cases are handled appropriately given the constraints.

Final: **True**
