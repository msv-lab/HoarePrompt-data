### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The array elements should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
   - If no such array exists, the function should print `-1`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes `max` to 100,000,000 and `min` to -100,000,000.
   - It then iterates while `x` is not 1, appending elements to the array `ans` based on whether `x` is even or odd.
   - If `x` is even, it appends the current `max` value and decrements `max`, then divides `x` by 2.
   - If `x` is odd, it appends the current `min` value and increments `min`, then subtracts 1 from `x`.
   - After the loop, it reverses the array `ans` and prints the length `t` and the elements of `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm aims to reduce `x` to 1 by either halving it (if even) or decrementing it (if odd).
   - The idea is to use the largest and smallest possible values to ensure that the array can have the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - However, the algorithm does not guarantee that the array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It only ensures that the array is constructed in a way that `x` is reduced to 1, but the number of increasing subsequences is not explicitly counted or verified.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The algorithm does not handle the case where `X` is 1 correctly. According to the problem, if `X` is 1, the function should print `-1` and not 0 and an empty array.
   - The algorithm does not verify that the generated array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, which is a crucial part of the problem statement.
   - The algorithm does not handle the case where no such array exists, which is required by the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The algorithm does not meet the requirements of the problem statement, particularly in handling the case where `X` is 1 and in verifying the number of increasing subsequences.

### Correctness: **False**
