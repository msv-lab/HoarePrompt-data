### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The function correctly assumes that it is possible to sort the array (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Traversal:**
   - The function traverses the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - For each element, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`.

4. **Splitting and Sorting Check:**
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the function splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the list is sorted, it updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split list.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if `ans` is `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Issues and Analysis:

- **Splitting and Sorting Check:**
  - The function's approach of splitting `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appending `arr[i]` to check if the resulting list is sorted is flawed.
  - This approach only checks the immediate split of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, and does not consider the possibility of splitting `arr[i - 1]` into multiple digits and then checking the entire array for sorted order.
  - For example, in the test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the function will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and append `28` to get `[1, 2, 28]`. It will then check if `[1, 2, 28]` is sorted, which it is, but it does not consider the possibility of further splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and checking if `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` can be sorted.

- **Example Analysis:**
  - **First Test Case:**
    - Array: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
    - After splitting the first element, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.
    - The array is sorted, so the output should be `YES`.
  - **Second Test Case:**
    - Array: `[12, 28, 5]`
    - After splitting the first element, the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
    - The function will check if `[1, 2, 28]` is sorted, which it is, but it does not consider the possibility of further splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and checking if `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` can be sorted.
    - The array cannot be sorted, so the output should be `NO`.
  - **Third Test Case:**
    - Array: `[0, 0]`
    - The array is already sorted, so the output should be `YES`.

### Correctness:
- The provided program does not correctly handle the splitting and sorting check for the entire array. It only checks the immediate split of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted after all possible operations.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
