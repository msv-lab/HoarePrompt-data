### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The function starts with the assumption that the array can be sorted (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Traversal:**
   - The function traverses the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - This is a good approach because it allows the function to check for the first instance where the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Splitting and Sorting Check:**
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the function splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This approach is flawed because it only checks the immediate split of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` and does not consider the possibility of splitting `arr[i - 1]` into multiple digits and then checking the entire array for sorted order.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if `ans` is `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Example Analysis:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Array: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - The function correctly identifies that `12` can be split into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Array: `[12, 28, 5]`
  - The function incorrectly identifies that `12` can be split into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, which is not sorted.
  - Output: `NO` (Correct, but the reasoning is flawed)
  - The correct approach would be to split `28` into `[2, 8]` and then check if the entire array can be sorted. The array would become `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which is still not sorted.

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Array: `[0, 0]`
  - The array is already sorted.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

### Correctness:

- The provided program does not correctly handle the splitting and sorting check for the entire array. It only checks the immediate split of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted after all possible operations.
- The program fails to consider the possibility of splitting multiple elements and checking the entire array for sorted order.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
