Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `m` which represents the length of the array.
   - It then reads `m` integers and stores them in the list `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The function assumes that it is possible to sort the array (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Traversal:**
   - The function traverses the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - For each element, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`.

4. **Splitting and Sorting Check:**
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, it splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if `ans` is `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Splitting and Sorting Check:**
  - The function splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
  - However, this approach is incorrect because it only checks the immediate split of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` and does not consider the possibility of splitting `arr[i - 1]` into multiple digits and then checking the entire array for sorted order.

- **Example Analysis:**
  - **First Test Case:**
    - Array: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
    - After splitting the first element, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.
    - The array is sorted, so the output should be `YES`.
  - **Second Test Case:**
    - Array: `[12, 28, 5]`
    - After splitting the first element, the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
    - The array is not sorted, so the output should be `NO`.
  - **Third Test Case:**
    - Array: `[0, 0]`
    - The array is already sorted, so the output should be `YES`.

### Correctness:
- The provided program does not correctly handle the splitting and sorting check for the entire array. It only checks the immediate split of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted after all possible operations.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
