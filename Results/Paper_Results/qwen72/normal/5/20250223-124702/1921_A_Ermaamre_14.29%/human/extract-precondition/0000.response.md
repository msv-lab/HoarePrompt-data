Precondition: **The function should take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple represents the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of a corner of the square. The list contains exactly four tuples, and each x_i and y_i is an integer such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**

Note: The function definition provided in the example is incomplete. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def find_square_area(corners):
```

Where `corners` is a list of four tuples, each representing the coordinates of a corner of the square.
