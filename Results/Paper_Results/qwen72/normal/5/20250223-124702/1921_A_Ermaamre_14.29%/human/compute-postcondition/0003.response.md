The function `func` accepts a parameter, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple represents the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of a corner of a square, and the list contains exactly four tuples. Each x_i and y_i is an integer such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns the area of the square.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of four tuples, each representing the coordinates of a corner of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It returns the area of the square.**
