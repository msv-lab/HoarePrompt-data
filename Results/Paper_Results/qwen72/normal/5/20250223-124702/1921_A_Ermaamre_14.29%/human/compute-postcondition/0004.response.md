Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `a` from the input, which determines the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads four pairs of integer coordinates from the input, representing the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The function calculates the side length of the square based on these coordinates and prints the square of the side length (i.e., the area of the square) for each iteration. The function does not return any value. **
