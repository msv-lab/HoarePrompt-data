Output State: **The function should take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple represents the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of a corner of the square. The list contains exactly four tuples, and each x_i and y_i is an integer such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. `a` is an input integer.**
