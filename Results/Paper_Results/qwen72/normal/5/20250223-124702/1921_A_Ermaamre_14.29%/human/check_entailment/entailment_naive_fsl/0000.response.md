Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases of input coordinates for the corners of the square. Specifically, the program assumes that the input coordinates will always be in one of the three specific orders checked by the `if` statements. However, the problem description states that the coordinates are given in random order, and there are many possible permutations of the coordinates that the program does not account for.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```
The program will not correctly compute the area because none of the `if` conditions will match, and the program will not compute the side length of the square. The correct area for this input should be 1, but the program will not output anything or will output an incorrect result.
