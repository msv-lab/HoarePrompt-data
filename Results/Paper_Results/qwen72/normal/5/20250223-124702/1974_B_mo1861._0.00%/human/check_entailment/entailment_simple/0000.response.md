Reasoning:

The program aims to decode a string that has been encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm for encoding involves:
1. Constructing a new string `r` from the distinct characters of the input string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
2. Replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character in `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second last, and so on).

To decode, the program should reverse this process. Here's the step-by-step reasoning for the correctness of the program:

1. **Character Mapping Construction**:
   - The program constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in the encoded string `b` is mapped to a corresponding character.
   - The characters in `b` are first sorted alphabetically and then mapped in reverse order to characters starting from 'a'.
   - This step is incorrect because the mapping should be based on the symmetric positions in the sorted unique characters of `b`, not on the length of `b`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program iterates over each character in `b` and replaces it with the corresponding character from `char_map`.
   - If the `char_map` were correctly constructed, this step would correctly decode the string.

However, the construction of `char_map` is flawed. The correct approach should be:
- Construct the string `r` from the sorted unique characters of `b`.
- Map the first character of `r` to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    
    #State: The `char_map` dictionary is populated with mappings from each unique character in the string `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted unique characters of `b`.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: The `char_map` dictionary remains unchanged. The string `b` remains unchanged. The string `s` is populated with the characters from `b` mapped through `char_map`, resulting in the original string `s`.
    return s
```

Given the current implementation, the program will not correctly decode the string because the `char_map` is not constructed correctly.

Correctness: **False**
