Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the flaw in the program. The issue lies in the construction of the `char_map` dictionary. The program currently maps each character in the sorted set of the encoded string `b` to a character in the reverse order of the alphabet, which is not the intended behavior according to the problem description.

According to the problem, the string `r` is constructed from the distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order. During encoding, each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`. Therefore, during decoding, each character in `b` should be replaced by its symmetric counterpart in the same `r`.

The provided function summary is not entirely accurate in describing the intended behavior of `func_1`. The summary states that the unique characters in `b` are sorted in reverse order and mapped to the lowercase alphabet starting from 'a'. This is incorrect. The characters should be mapped to their symmetric counterparts in the sorted set of distinct characters from `b`.

The corrected version of the function, as suggested in the original assessment, correctly constructs the `char_map` by mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted set of distinct characters from `b`. This ensures that the decoding process matches the problem description.

Here is the corrected function again for clarity:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {distinct_chars[i]: distinct_chars[len(distinct_chars) - i - 1] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

This corrected function will correctly decode the encoded string `b` to the original string `s`.

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect, and the original assessment accurately identifies the issue and provides a correct solution. Therefore, the final evaluation is **False**.
