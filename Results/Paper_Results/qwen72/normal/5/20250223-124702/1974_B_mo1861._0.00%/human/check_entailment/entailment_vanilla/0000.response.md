Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.

2. **Character Mapping**:
   - The program constructs a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted set is mapped to its symmetric character. The symmetric character is determined by the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted set.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program iterates over each character in the encoded string `b`.
   - For each character, it uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding symmetric character and appends it to the decoded string `s`.

4. **Output**:
   - The decoded string `s` is printed for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in the character mapping logic:
- The formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` is incorrect. It should map the characters based on their position in the sorted set of unique characters, not based on the length of the entire string `b`.

The correct formula should be:
- `char_map[c] = sorted_unique_chars[-(i + 1)]`, where `sorted_unique_chars` is the sorted list of unique characters.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    sorted_unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted_unique_chars):
        char_map[c] = sorted_unique_chars[-(i + 1)]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

With this correction, the program will correctly map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in the sorted set of unique characters.

Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect character mapping logic in the original program).
