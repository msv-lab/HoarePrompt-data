Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. The issue lies in the construction of the `char_map` dictionary. The program maps each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character in the reverse order of the alphabet, but it should map each character to its symmetric counterpart in the string `r`, which is the sorted set of distinct characters from the original string `s`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Construct the auxiliary string r from the encoded string b
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric counterpart
    char_map = {r[i]: r[len(r) - i - 1] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Decode the string b using the char_map
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    
    return s
```

This corrected version constructs the auxiliary string `r` correctly and then creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart. Finally, it decodes the string `b` using this mapping.
