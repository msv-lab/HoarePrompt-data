Output State: `t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. `n` remains an input integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks. `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks, and retains the values provided by the user. `ans` remains 0. `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that stick length appears in the list `a`.
