The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.

The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the input. However, the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Assuming the function is designed to return some result based on the stick lengths for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of sticks for each test case), and `a` (a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks). For each test case, it processes the stick lengths and returns a result based on the input.**
