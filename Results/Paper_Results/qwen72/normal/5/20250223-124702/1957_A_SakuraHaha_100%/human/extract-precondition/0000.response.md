Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t, a list of n values, and a list of stick lengths a. t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list, a_list):
```

Where `n_list` is a list of integers, each representing the number of sticks for a test case, and `a_list` is a list of lists, each sublist containing the lengths of the sticks for a corresponding test case.
