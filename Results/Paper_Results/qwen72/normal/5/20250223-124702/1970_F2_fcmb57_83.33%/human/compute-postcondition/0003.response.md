The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams, respectively, with the constraint that 0 <= a, b <= 10000. The function results in an error because `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, no values are returned.
