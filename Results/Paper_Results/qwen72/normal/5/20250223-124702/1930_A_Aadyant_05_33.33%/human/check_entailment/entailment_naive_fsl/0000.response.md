Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it handles the selection of pairs from the sorted list. Specifically, the program always selects the first element of each pair in the sorted list, which is not always the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

The expected output should be:
```
9
```

However, the program will output:
```
6
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
- The program sorts the list to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- It then selects the first element of each pair: `[1, 3, 5]`.
- The sum of these elements is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

But the program actually selects: `[1, 2, 3]`, resulting in a sum of `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always select the smallest two elements in each move. This ensures that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible. The correct approach would be to sort the list and then sum the first `n` elements of the sorted list.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for _ in range(int(num)):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().split()
        a = [int(x) for x in a]
        a.sort()
        out.append(sum(a[:n]))
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
```

This corrected program will correctly handle all potential cases and produce the expected output.
