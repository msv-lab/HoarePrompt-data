### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of 2n integers.
   - The list of integers is split and sorted.

2. **Processing**:
   - The function aims to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
   - By sorting the list, the function ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
   - The function then iterates through the sorted list, selecting every second element (starting from the first) and adding it to the score. This is because the sorted list will have the smallest elements at the even indices when considering 0-based indexing.

3. **Output**:
   - The function appends the sum of the selected elements to the `out` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each element in the `out` list.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the optimal strategy by sorting the list and selecting the smallest elements in pairs.
  - The score is calculated by summing the elements at even indices in the sorted list, which is the correct approach to maximize the score.

- **Input and Output Handling**:
  - The function reads the input correctly and processes each test case as described.
  - The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output for the given examples.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or the maximum allowed value (50) correctly.
  - The function also handles cases where all elements are the same or vary widely within the allowed range.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly processes the input, applies the optimal strategy to maximize the score, and produces the expected output.

### Correctness:
**True**
