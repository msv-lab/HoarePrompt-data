Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Digit Parsing**: For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This is the correct condition for a stair as defined in the problem.

4. **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is correct because it ensures that `b` is the maximum of the three digits, which is the definition of a peak (`a < b > c`).

5. **Equality Condition**: The program checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same. If they are, it prints "NONE". This is correct because if all digits are the same, they do not form a stair or a peak.

6. **Else Condition**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NONE". This is correct because if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, they should be classified as "NONE".

7. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, which is either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions checked.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
