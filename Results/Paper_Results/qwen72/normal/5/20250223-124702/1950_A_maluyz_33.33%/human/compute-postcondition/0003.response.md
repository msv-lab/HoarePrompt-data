The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is designed to work with an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, it deals with digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return some result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, it processes three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9). The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided.**
