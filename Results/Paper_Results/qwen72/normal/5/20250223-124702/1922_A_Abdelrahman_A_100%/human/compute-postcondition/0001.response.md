The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `tests`. For the loop to execute, `tests` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will increment by 1 with each iteration of the loop. The conditions for `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are given as part of the problem statement but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
