Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases, and for each query, it has printed the minimum distance between the cities represented by the indices x_i and y_i. The variables t, n, lst, m, d1, d2, start, end, inc, and s have been updated and used during the execution of the loop, but their final values are not relevant to the output state. The initial state of the input variables (t, n, lst, m, x_i, y_i) remains unchanged as they are read from input for each test case.**
