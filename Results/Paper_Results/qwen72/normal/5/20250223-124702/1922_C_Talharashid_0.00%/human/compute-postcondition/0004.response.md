Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers in ascending order, representing the positions of cities. It then reads an integer `m` and a list of `m` queries, where each query is a pair of integers `(x_i, y_i)` representing two different cities. For each query, the function calculates and prints the minimum distance between the two cities, considering the distances in both directions (forward and backward) along the list of cities. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. The initial state of the input variables (t, n, lst, m, x_i, y_i) remains unchanged as they are read from input for each test case. **
