### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating `t` times. In each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Check**: The function checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is the correct condition to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves:
   - **`n >= m`**: This ensures that Nikita has enough moves to build a tower of at least `m` cubes.
   - **`(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This ensures that the number of moves left after building `m` cubes is even. This is because each move can either add or remove a cube, and the total number of moves must be even to balance out the additions and removals to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

3. **Output**: The function prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise. The output is case-insensitive, so 'YES' and 'NO' are valid.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 3` and `m = 3`, the condition `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is true, so the output is 'YES'.
   - For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the condition `n >= m` is false, so the output is 'NO'.
   - For `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the condition `n >= m` is true and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is true, so the output is 'YES'.

5. **Variable Scope**: The variables `n` and `m` are correctly scoped within the loop, and they are re-assigned for each test case. The variable `t` is not needed after the loop starts, so it's not a concern.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Nikita can end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, and it handles multiple test cases as expected.

Correctness: **True**
