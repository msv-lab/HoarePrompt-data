Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible for Nikita to build a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key logic in the program is the condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:`. This condition checks two things:
1. `n >= m`: This ensures that Nikita has at least as many moves as the number of cubes he wants to end up with.
2. `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove a cube, and the net effect of the moves must be even to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

Let's analyze the correctness of this logic:
- If `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to build a tower of `m` cubes with only `n` moves, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even. If it is, Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes by adding and removing cubes in a way that the net effect is `m` cubes. For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 3`, Nikita can add a cube three times. If `n = 5` and `m = 3`, Nikita can add a cube five times and then remove two cubes.
- If the difference `(n - m)` is odd, it's impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes because the net effect of the moves would be odd, and you can't achieve an even net effect with an odd number of moves.

The program handles all the test cases correctly based on the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
