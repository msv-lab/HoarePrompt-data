Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, and for each test case, it has printed 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, otherwise it has printed 'NO'. The variables `n` and `m` are no longer in scope after the loop completes, and the variable `t` (number of test cases) is unchanged.**
