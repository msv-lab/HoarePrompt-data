Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Reading Test Cases**: For each test case, the program reads two integers `n` and `m`. This is also correct according to the problem description.

3. **Logic for Determining Validity**:
   - The condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:` checks two things:
     - `n >= m`: This ensures that Nikita has enough moves to build a tower of at least `m` cubes.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the number of moves left after building `m` cubes is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove a cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves will be zero (i.e., the tower height remains unchanged).

4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, and 'NO' otherwise. This matches the expected output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is exactly equal to `m` (e.g., `n = 3, m = 3`), which should output 'YES'.
   - The program correctly handles cases where `n` is less than `m` (e.g., `n = 2, m = 4`), which should output 'NO'.
   - The program also handles cases where `n` is greater than `m` but the difference is odd (e.g., `n = 5, m = 2`), which should output 'NO'.

6. **Scope and State**:
   - The variables `n` and `m` are correctly scoped within the loop and are re-initialized for each test case.
   - The loop variable `_` is used to iterate over the test cases, which is a common and correct practice when the index is not needed.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
