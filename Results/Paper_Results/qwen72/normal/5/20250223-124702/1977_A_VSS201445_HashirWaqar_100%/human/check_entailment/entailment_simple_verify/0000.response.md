Reasoning: The original assessment is incorrect in its conclusion. The program already handles the case where `n < m` implicitly. The condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:` ensures that the program only outputs "YES" when `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even. If `n < m`, the condition `n >= m` will be false, and the program will directly print "NO" without needing an explicit check for `n < m`.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Initial Condition**: The loop runs for each test case, reading `n` and `m` from input.
2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are true, it prints "YES".
   - If either condition is false, it prints "NO".

This logic is correct because:
- If `n < m`, the condition `n >= m` will be false, and the program will print "NO".
- If `n >= m` but `(n - m) % 2 != 0`, the program will also print "NO".
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, the program will print "YES".

The program correctly handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
