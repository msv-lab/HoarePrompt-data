Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. To match the problem description, the function definition should be updated to include the necessary parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `m`.

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and test_cases is a list of length t, where each element is a tuple (n, m) of integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.**
