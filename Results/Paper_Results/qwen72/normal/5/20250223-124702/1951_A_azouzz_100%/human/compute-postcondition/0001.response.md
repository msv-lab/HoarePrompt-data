The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `start` and `end` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used, so its initial state is not relevant.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0**
