The only objects in the loop head are the variables `num` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, and `final` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 and `num` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
