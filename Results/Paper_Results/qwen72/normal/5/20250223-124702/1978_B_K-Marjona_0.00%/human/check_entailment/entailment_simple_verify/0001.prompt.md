You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The loop executes t times, and for each iteration, it reads n, a, and b from input, calculates k as the minimum of n and (b - a), and prints the result of the calculation based on the conditions provided. The values of t, n, a, and b are not retained between iterations, and the loop does not modify any variables outside of its scope.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case. This is done using a loop and the `input().split()` method to parse the input.

2. **Choosing `k`**: The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This is a reasonable choice because:
   - `k` should not exceed `n` because Bob cannot sell more buns than he has.
   - `k` should not exceed `b - a` because if `k` is greater than `b - a`, the modified price of the buns would drop below the usual price `a`, which is not beneficial.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price would not provide any additional benefit. The profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price:
     - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`. This formula correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which is the correct format for the output.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `b <= a` by simply printing `a * n`.
   - The program also handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` (up to \(10^9\)) efficiently, as the arithmetic operations and the loop over test cases are both O(1) and O(t) respectively.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
