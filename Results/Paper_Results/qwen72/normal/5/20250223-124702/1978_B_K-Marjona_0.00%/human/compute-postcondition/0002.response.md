The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it accepts `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are integers. The constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since the specific output logic is not provided, we can only describe the parameters and the general return behavior.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
