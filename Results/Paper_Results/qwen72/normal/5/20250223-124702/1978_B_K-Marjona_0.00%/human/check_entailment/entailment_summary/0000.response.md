### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Promotion Logic**:
   - The function calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is the number of buns that Bob will sell at the modified price.
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means that the modified price is not beneficial, and Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. Hence, the profit is `a * n`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, the function calculates the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is simply `(n - k) * a`.

4. **Arithmetic Series Sum**:
   - The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` is used to calculate the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series with the first term `b` and the last term `b - k + 1`. This is correct because the sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula `S = (first_term + last_term) / 2 * number_of_terms`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where `b` is less than or equal to `a` by directly printing `a * n`.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is 0, which means no buns are sold at the modified price, and all buns are sold at the usual price.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns, considering the promotion. The calculations and conditions are appropriate for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
