Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in the calculation of the maximum profit. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is incorrect. The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` does not correctly compute the sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.

The correct formula to calculate the sum of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price should be:

\[
\text{Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1)
\]

This can be simplified to:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{k \cdot (2b - k + 1)}{2}
\]

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            profit_from_modified = (k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2
            profit_from_usual = (n - k) * a
            print(profit_from_modified + profit_from_usual)
```

This corrected program should now correctly compute the maximum profit Bob can obtain.
