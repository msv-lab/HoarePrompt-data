Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Password Composition**: The program checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods. This is implicitly handled by the logic that separates letters and digits into different lists.

2. **No Digit After a Letter**: The program iterates through the password and checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Sorted Digits**: The program collects all digits in a list and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function. If the digits are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Sorted Letters**: Similarly, the program collects all letters in a list and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function. If the letters are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Password**: The problem description specifies that the password length \( n \) is at least 1, so an empty password is not a valid input.
   - **Single Character Password**: The program correctly handles single character passwords, whether they are a letter or a digit.
   - **Only Digits or Only Letters**: The program correctly handles passwords that consist only of digits or only of letters, as the conditions for sorting and no digit after a letter are trivially satisfied.

Since the program correctly handles all the conditions and edge cases specified in the problem description, it is considered correct.
