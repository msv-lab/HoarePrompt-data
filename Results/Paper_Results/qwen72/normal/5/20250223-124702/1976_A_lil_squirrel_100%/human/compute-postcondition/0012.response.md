Output State: **If the loop completes all iterations without encountering a return statement, the state remains unchanged: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted. If the loop encounters a return statement, the output is 'NO' and the function exits.**
