Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotated version to validate or challenge this assessment.

1. **Password Composition**:
   - The program implicitly handles the condition that the password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods to separate characters into `letters` and `digits` lists. If the password contains any other characters, they will not be added to either list, but the program does not explicitly check for this. However, since the problem description guarantees valid inputs, this is not an issue.

2. **No Digit After a Letter**:
   - The program iterates through the password and checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter using the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(len(password) - 1):
         if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
             return 'NO'
     ```
   - This loop correctly identifies and returns 'NO' if a digit follows a letter, which satisfies the condition.

3. **Sorted Digits**:
   - The program collects all digits in a list and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function:
     ```python
     if digits != sorted(digits):
         return 'NO'
     ```
   - This check ensures that all digits are in the correct order, which satisfies the condition.

4. **Sorted Letters**:
   - The program collects all letters in a list and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function:
     ```python
     if letters != sorted(letters):
         return 'NO'
     ```
   - This check ensures that all letters are in the correct order, which satisfies the condition.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Password**: The problem description specifies that the password length \( n \) is at least 1, so an empty password is not a valid input. The program does not need to handle this case.
   - **Single Character Password**: The program correctly handles single character passwords, whether they are a letter or a digit. If the password is a single letter, the `letters` list will have one element, and the `sorted(letters)` check will pass. Similarly, if the password is a single digit, the `digits` list will have one element, and the `sorted(digits)` check will pass.
   - **Only Digits or Only Letters**: The program correctly handles passwords that consist only of digits or only of letters. In such cases, one of the lists (`letters` or `digits`) will be empty, and the sorting checks will trivially pass.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description and handles the edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
