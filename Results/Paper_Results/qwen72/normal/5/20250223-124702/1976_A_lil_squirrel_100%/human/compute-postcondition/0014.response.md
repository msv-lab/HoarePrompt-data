The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `password`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function returns 'NO' in Case_1 and Case_2, and 'YES' in Case_3. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (where `n` is between 1 and 20 and `password` consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits), and return 'NO' in two specific cases, and 'YES' in another specific case.
