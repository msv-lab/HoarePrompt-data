Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square. It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (which, given that the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, is the length of a side of the square). Finally, it prints the area of the square by squaring this difference. This approach works because the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) will always give the side length of the square, and the area is simply the side length squared.
