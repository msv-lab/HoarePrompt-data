Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading four pairs of coordinates. Each coordinate pair is stored in a list `a`.

2. **Extracting X-coordinates**: The program extracts the X-coordinates from the list of points `a` and stores them in a list `x`.

3. **Calculating Side Length**: The program calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum X-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by the difference in either the X-coordinates or the Y-coordinates.

4. **Calculating Area**: The program calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length (`dx * dx`) and prints the result.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times.

6. **Constraints**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description. It assumes that the input coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program should work correctly for edge cases such as squares with small side lengths (e.g., side length 1) and large side lengths (e.g., side length 1000).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
