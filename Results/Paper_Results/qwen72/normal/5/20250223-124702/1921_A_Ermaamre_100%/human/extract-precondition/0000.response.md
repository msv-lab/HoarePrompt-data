Precondition: **The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area with corners at these points. The number of test cases, t, is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to accept the input as described. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(test_cases):
```

With the precondition:

**test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area with corners at these points. The number of test cases, t, is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100.**
