### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` is designed to count the frequency of each number in the input list `nums`, but it caps the frequency at `k` if a number appears more than `k` times. This is not necessary for the problem, as we need to know the exact frequency of each number to determine the minimum number of cards left.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n` because no operations can be performed.
   - If `k` is in the values of the frequency table, the program prints `k - 1`. This is based on the idea that if there is a group of `k` cards with the same number, you can exchange them for `k - 1` cards, and the minimum number of cards left will be `k - 1`.

4. **General Case Handling**: If `k` is not in the values of the frequency table, the program prints `n`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of performing multiple exchanges to reduce the number of cards further.

5. **Optimal Solution**:
   - The correct approach is to calculate the total number of cards that can be exchanged. For each number, if its frequency is a multiple of `k`, you can exchange all of them. If the frequency is not a multiple of `k`, you can exchange as many as possible and leave the remainder.
   - The minimum number of cards left is the sum of the remainders when each frequency is divided by `k`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the general case where the frequency of a number is not a multiple of `k`. It should calculate the remainder of each frequency divided by `k` and sum these remainders to determine the minimum number of cards left. The current implementation only checks if there is a group of exactly `k` cards and prints `k - 1` if so, which is not sufficient for all cases.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards_left = sum(f % k for f in freq.values())
        print(min_cards_left)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **func_1**: This function now correctly counts the frequency of each number without capping it.
- **Main Loop**: After calculating the frequencies, the program sums the remainders of each frequency divided by `k` to get the minimum number of cards left. This ensures that the program handles all cases correctly.
