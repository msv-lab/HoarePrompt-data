Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function and the main loop is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that if any number appears exactly `k` times, the result should be `k - 1`. However, this is not always the case. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 3
1 1 1 2 2
```
The correct output should be `2` because you can exchange the three `1`s for two new cards, and you will be left with `2` cards. However, the program will output `5` because it does not correctly handle the case where a number appears exactly `k` times and the rest of the cards are different.

The program should instead calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally. This involves considering the frequency of each number and determining how many cards can be exchanged to minimize the total number of cards left.
