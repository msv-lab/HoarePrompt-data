You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, n and m, where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: *`n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program retains the values of `n` and `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, the program also retains the values of `n` and `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from user input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. After reading the input, the function prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and prints 'No' if `n` is less than `m`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `n` and `m` are retained in the program.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - The program checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower).
   - If `n >= m`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "No".

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic `n >= m` is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move. Therefore, the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves must be `n - 2k` where `k` is the number of times he removes a cube.
   - For the tower to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, `n - 2k` must equal `m` for some integer `k`.
   - This can be simplified to `n - m` being an even number. If `n - m` is even, then it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For `n = 3` and `m = 3`, `n - m = 0` (even), so the answer should be "Yes".
   - For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, `n - m = -2` (even), but `n < m`, so the answer should be "No".
   - For `n = 5` and `m = 3`, `n - m = 2` (even), so the answer should be "Yes".

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not the correct condition to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The correct condition should be whether `n - m` is even.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
