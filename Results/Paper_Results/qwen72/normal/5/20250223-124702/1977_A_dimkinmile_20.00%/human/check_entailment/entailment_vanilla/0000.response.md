### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - The program checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower).
   - If `n >= m`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "No".

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic `n >= m` is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move. Therefore, the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves must be `n - 2k` where `k` is the number of times he removes a cube.
   - For the tower to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, `n - 2k` must equal `m` for some integer `k`.
   - This can be simplified to `n - m` being an even number. If `n - m` is even, then it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For `n = 3` and `m = 3`, `n - m = 0` (even), so the answer should be "Yes".
   - For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, `n - m = -2` (even), but `n < m`, so the answer should be "No".
   - For `n = 5` and `m = 3`, `n - m = 2` (even), so the answer should be "Yes".

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not the correct condition to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The correct condition should be whether `n - m` is even.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
