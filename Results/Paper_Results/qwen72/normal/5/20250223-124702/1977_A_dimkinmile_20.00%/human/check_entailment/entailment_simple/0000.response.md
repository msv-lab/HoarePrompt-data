Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of determining if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. The logic in the function `func_1` checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise it prints "No".

However, this logic is flawed. The key insight to solving this problem is that each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower. Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer from `0` to `n` (inclusive) that has the same parity (odd or even) as `n`. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and starting from 0, the parity of the number of cubes will always match the parity of the number of moves.

To correctly determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to check two conditions:
1. `n` must be greater than or equal to `m` (since you can't have more cubes than the number of moves).
2. `n` and `m` must have the same parity (both must be either odd or even).

The given program only checks the first condition (`n >= m`). It does not check the parity condition, which is crucial for the correctness of the solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
