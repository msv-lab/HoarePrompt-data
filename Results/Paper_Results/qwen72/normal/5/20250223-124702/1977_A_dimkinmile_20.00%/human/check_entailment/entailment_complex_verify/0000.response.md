Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic is indeed flawed because it only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is insufficient to determine whether it's possible to achieve a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The correct condition to check is whether `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd) or if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. This is because each move can only change the number of cubes by 1, and if `n` and `m` have different parities, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

For example:
- If `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the program will print "No" because `n < m`, but it should print "Yes" because after 2 moves, Nikita can have 2 cubes, and in subsequent moves, he can add more cubes to reach 4 cubes.
- If `n = 3` and `m = 2`, the program will print "Yes" because `n >= m`, but it should print "No" because after 3 moves, it's impossible to end up with exactly 2 cubes (the number of cubes will be either 1 or 3).

The program fails to handle these cases correctly, and thus the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

Final: **False**
