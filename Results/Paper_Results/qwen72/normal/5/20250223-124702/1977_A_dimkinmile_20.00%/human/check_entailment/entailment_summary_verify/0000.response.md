Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the logic of the function `func_1`. The program's current logic only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is insufficient to determine whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key issue is that the program does not account for the possibility of removing cubes, which can affect the parity of the number of cubes in the tower.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the following:
- If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it is possible to achieve a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move (adding or removing a cube) changes the number of cubes by 1, which preserves the parity.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it is also possible to achieve a tower of `m` cubes, as Nikita can simply add cubes until the tower has `m` cubes.

The program's current logic fails to check the parity of `n` and `m`, which is crucial for determining the possibility of achieving the desired tower height. For example, in the test case `2 4`, the program will print "No" because `n < m`, but it is actually possible to achieve a tower of 4 cubes if Nikita first adds 2 cubes and then continues to add more cubes in subsequent moves.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
