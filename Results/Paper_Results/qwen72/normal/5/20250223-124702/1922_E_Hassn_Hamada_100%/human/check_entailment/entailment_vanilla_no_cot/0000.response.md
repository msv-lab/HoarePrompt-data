Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for the given constraints and requirements. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Output for `n = 2`**:
   - The program prints `1` and `0` for `n = 2`, which is incorrect. The array `[0]` has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]` itself), not 2.

2. **Incorrect Output for `n = 5`**:
   - The program prints `3` and `0 1 0` for `n = 5`, which is incorrect. The array `[0, 1, 0]` has the following increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0]`, and `[0, 1]`. This is 5 increasing subsequences, but the array is not valid because it has duplicate elements at different positions, which should be considered different.

3. **Incorrect Output for `n = 13`**:
   - The program prints `5` and `2 2 3 4 2` for `n = 13`, which is incorrect. The array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has duplicate elements, and the number of increasing subsequences is not 13.

4. **Incorrect Output for `n = 37`**:
   - The program prints `7` and `-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1` for `n = 37`, which is incorrect. The array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has duplicate elements, and the number of increasing subsequences is not 37.

The program's logic for generating the sequence and counting the increasing subsequences is flawed. It does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem, leading to incorrect outputs for the given test cases.
