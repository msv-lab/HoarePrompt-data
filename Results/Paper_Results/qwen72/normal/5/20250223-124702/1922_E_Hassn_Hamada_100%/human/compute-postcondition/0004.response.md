Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9], `size_overlap` is (0, 0).**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new assignment of `size_overlap` to the tuple (0, 0). The value of `number` is still an integer within the specified range, and `sequence` is still a list of integers with the specified properties.
