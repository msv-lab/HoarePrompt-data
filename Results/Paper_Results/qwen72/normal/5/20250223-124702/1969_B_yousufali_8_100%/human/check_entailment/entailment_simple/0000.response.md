### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the binary string `s`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - In `func_1`, the binary string `s` is read from the input.
   - The variable `n` is initialized to 0, which will count the number of '1's in the string.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the total cost to sort the string.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The function iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments `n` by 1.
   - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - This is because each '0' that is followed by at least one '1' requires a cyclic shift to move the '1' to the left of the '0'.
     - The cost of each shift is `n + 1` because it involves the '0' and all the '1's to its left.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing the string, the function prints the value of `ans`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- The algorithm correctly identifies the number of '1's in the string and the positions of '0's that need to be shifted.
- The cost calculation is based on the number of '1's to the left of each '0' that needs to be moved, which is a valid approach to determine the minimum cost to sort the string.
- The function handles the edge case where the string is already sorted by not adding any cost if `n` is 0 when a '0' is encountered.

### Edge Cases:

- **All '0's or All '1's:**
  - If the string consists entirely of '0's, `n` will remain 0, and `ans` will be 0.
  - If the string consists entirely of '1's, `ans` will be 0 because there are no '0's to shift.
- **Single '0' or '1':**
  - The function correctly handles strings of length 2 or more, as specified in the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The cost calculation and the handling of multiple test cases are both correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
