### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of these operations.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single binary string `s` and calculates the minimum cost to sort it.
   - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - For each '0' in the string, if there are any '1's before it (`n != 0`), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because shifting a substring containing the '0' and all '1's before it to the end of the string will move the '0' to the correct position, and the cost of this operation is `n + 1`.
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

4. **Validation of the Approach**:
   - The approach in `func_1` is correct because it identifies the necessary shifts to move '0's to the correct position by counting the number of '1's before each '0'.
   - The cost calculation `n + 1` is accurate for each shift operation.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" where the cost is 0).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles strings with only '0's or only '1's, as no shifts are needed in these cases.
   - It also handles the case where the string is already sorted, as no shifts are needed and the cost is 0.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it meets the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
