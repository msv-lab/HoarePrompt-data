Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the cost of sorting the binary string, but it does so in a way that does not account for the optimal strategy to minimize the total cost.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost by adding `n + 1` whenever it encounters a '0' after a sequence of '1's. This is not the correct way to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.
   - The correct approach should consider the number of '1's that need to be moved to the end of the string and the number of '0's that need to be moved to the beginning of the string.

2. **Handling of Test Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program will produce incorrect results for the test cases.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Count the number of '1's in the string.
- Calculate the cost of moving all '1's to the end of the string.
- Calculate the cost of moving all '0's to the beginning of the string.
- The minimum of these two costs will be the answer.

### Example Correct Solution:
```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    ones = s.count('1')
    zeros = s.count('0')
    
    # Calculate the cost to move all '1's to the end
    cost_to_move_ones = ones * (n - ones)
    
    # Calculate the cost to move all '0's to the beginning
    cost_to_move_zeros = zeros * ones
    
    # The minimum of the two costs is the answer
    ans = min(cost_to_move_ones, cost_to_move_zeros)
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Counting '1's and '0's:**
  - `ones` is the number of '1's in the string.
  - `zeros` is the number of '0's in the string.
- **Cost Calculation:**
  - `cost_to_move_ones` is the cost to move all '1's to the end of the string. This is calculated as the number of '1's times the number of '0's, because each '1' needs to be moved past each '0'.
  - `cost_to_move_zeros` is the cost to move all '0's to the beginning of the string. This is also calculated as the number of '0's times the number of '1's.
- **Output:**
  - The minimum of these two costs is printed as the answer.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.
