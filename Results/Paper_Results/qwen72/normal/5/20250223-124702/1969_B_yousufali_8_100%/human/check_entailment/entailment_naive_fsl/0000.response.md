Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the string is already sorted. For example, if the input string is "0000", the program should output 0 because no operations are needed. However, the `func_1` function will still iterate through the string and potentially add to `ans` even though the string is already sorted. This is because the function does not check if the string is already sorted before performing any operations, leading to incorrect results in such cases.
