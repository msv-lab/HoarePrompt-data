Reasoning:  
The program provided is mostly correct, but there are a few points to consider:

1. **Function Call and Definition**: The function `func_1` is called without any arguments in the main loop, but it should be defined to accept the necessary parameters for the array `c`, the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. However, the function itself does not use the `t` parameter, and it reads the input directly, which is fine for the given problem. The function should be called in a loop for each test case, but the function itself handles the input for each test case correctly.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input for each test case and processes the array `nums` and the queries. The use of `map` and `input().split(' ')` is appropriate for parsing the input.

3. **Auxiliary Lists**: The auxiliary lists `ones` and `sum` are correctly calculated:
   - `ones[i]` stores the count of `1`s from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.
   - `sum[i]` stores the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1` and 1.

4. **Query Processing**: The query processing logic is correct:
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray is good by verifying the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`.
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray can be split into a different array `b` that meets the criteria (all elements are positive and different from the corresponding elements in the subarray).

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge case where `l == r` by immediately printing 'NO' because a subarray of length 1 cannot be good (it cannot have a different positive value).

Given these points, the program is logically correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
