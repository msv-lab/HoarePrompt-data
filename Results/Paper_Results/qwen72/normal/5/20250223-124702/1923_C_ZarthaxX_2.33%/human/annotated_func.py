#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. For example, the function might be defined as `def func_1(t, n, c, q, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c`, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: `ones` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of `1`s in the `nums` list from the start up to index `i-1`. `sum` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1` and 1. The values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `ones` and `sum` remain unchanged, and the values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` (the length of an array) and `q` (the number of queries). It then reads `n` integers into a list `nums`. The function calculates two auxiliary lists, `ones` and `sum`, where `ones[i]` is the count of `1`s in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1`, and `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1` and 1. For each of the `q` queries, which specify a range `[l, r]` within `nums`, the function checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds, where `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are the counts of `1`s and the sum of differences within the specified range, respectively. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values and does not modify the input variables `nums`, `n`, or `q`.
