The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `q`. The loop will execute if `q` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it does not carry any significant state. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `q` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`ones` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of `1`s in the `nums` list from the start up to index `i-1`, `sum` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1` and 1, `nums`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged, `q` must be greater than 0**
