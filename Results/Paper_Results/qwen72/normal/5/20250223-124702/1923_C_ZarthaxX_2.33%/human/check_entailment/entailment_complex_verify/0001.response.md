### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `testCases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays:**
   - `ones` is used to keep track of the cumulative count of 1s in the array `nums`.
   - `sum` is used to keep track of the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` for each index `i`.

3. **Cumulative Calculations:**
   - The program correctly updates the `ones` array to count the number of 1s up to each index.
   - The `sum` array is updated to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` up to each index.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the range `[l, r]`.
   - If `l == r`, it immediately prints `NO` because a single element cannot be changed to a different positive integer while maintaining the sum.
   - For ranges where `l != r`, it calculates the number of 1s in the range `onesInRange` and the sum of `nums[i] - 1` in the range `sumInRange`.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds.
   - This condition can be simplified to:
     - `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`
   - This ensures that the number of 1s in the range plus the number of elements in the range should be less than or equal to the sum of `nums[i] - 1` in the range.
   - This condition is necessary to ensure that there are enough "slack" in the sum to change each element to a different positive integer while maintaining the sum and ensuring no element is the same as in the original subarray.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints `YES` if the condition holds, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Analysis of the Condition:
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to:
  - `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`
  - This means that the number of 1s in the range plus the number of elements in the range should be less than or equal to the sum of `nums[i] - 1` in the range.
  - This ensures that there are enough "slack" in the sum to change each element to a different positive integer while maintaining the sum and ensuring no element is the same as in the original subarray.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles the case where `l == r` by immediately printing `NO`.
- The program correctly handles the cumulative sums and counts, ensuring that the calculations are efficient and correct.

### Final Evaluation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The reasoning and the implementation are sound.

Final: **True**
