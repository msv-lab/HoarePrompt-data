Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` and `q` are integers, `c` is an array, `t` is the number of test cases, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `sum` with a length of `n + 1`, where each element is set to 0. The values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `t`, and `ones` remain unchanged.
