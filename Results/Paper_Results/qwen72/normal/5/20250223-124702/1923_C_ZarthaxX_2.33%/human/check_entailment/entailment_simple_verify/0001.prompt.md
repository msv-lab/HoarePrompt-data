You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. For example, the function might be defined as `def func_1(t, n, c, q, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c`, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: `ones` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of `1`s in the `nums` list from the start up to index `i-1`. `sum` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1` and 1. The values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `ones` and `sum` remain unchanged, and the values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `testCases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays:**
   - `ones` is used to keep track of the cumulative count of 1s in the array `nums`.
   - `sum` is used to keep track of the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` for each index `i`.

3. **Cumulative Calculations:**
   - The program correctly updates the `ones` array to count the number of 1s up to each index.
   - The `sum` array is updated to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` up to each index.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the range `[l, r]`.
   - If `l == r`, it immediately prints `NO` because a single element cannot be changed to a different positive integer while maintaining the sum.
   - For ranges where `l != r`, it calculates the number of 1s in the range `onesInRange` and the sum of `nums[i] - 1` in the range `sumInRange`.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds.
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray can be adjusted to a different set of positive integers while maintaining the sum and ensuring no element is the same as in the original subarray.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints `YES` if the condition holds, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Analysis of the Condition:
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` can be simplified to:
  - `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`
  - This means that the number of 1s in the range plus the number of elements in the range should be less than or equal to the sum of `nums[i] - 1` in the range.
  - This ensures that there are enough "slack" in the sum to change each element to a different positive integer.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles the case where `l == r` by immediately printing `NO`.
- The program correctly handles the cumulative sums and counts, ensuring that the calculations are efficient and correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The reasoning and the implementation are sound.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
