Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of integers n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5) for each test case, where n is the largest number written on the board.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases and a list of integers for each test case. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of integers `n` for each test case.
