### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then initializes a list `values` of size `200001` (which is `inf`), where `values[i]` will store the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The function iterates from 1 to `inf - 1` (i.e., 200000) to precompute the cumulative sum of the digits.
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits by converting the integer to a string and summing the integer values of its characters.
   - It then updates `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[i - 1]` and the sum of the digits of `i`. This ensures that `values[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the digits from 1 to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The function then reads `t` test cases, each containing an integer `value`.
   - For each test case, it prints `values[value]`, which is the precomputed cumulative sum of the digits from 1 to `value`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where `n` is 200000. This is efficient and within the time limit for the problem.
   - Each test case is processed in O(1) time by simply accessing the precomputed value in the `values` list. This is very efficient and well within the 0.5 seconds per test case limit.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The precomputation logic is correct and ensures that `values[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the digits from 1 to `i`.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading each `value` and printing the corresponding precomputed result.

The given program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
