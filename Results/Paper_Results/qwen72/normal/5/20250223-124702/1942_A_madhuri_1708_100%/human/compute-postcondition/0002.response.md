The function `find_array` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. The parameters must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function returns an array based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and returns an array based on these parameters.**
