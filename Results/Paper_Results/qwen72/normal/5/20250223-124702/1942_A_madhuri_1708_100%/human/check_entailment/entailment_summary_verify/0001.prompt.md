You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple lines from standard input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, if `k` is 1 or less, it prints a list of integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is 2 or more, it prints either `-1` if `n` is not equal to `k`, or a list of `k` integers, each equal to `k`, if `n` is equal to `k`. The function processes all lines until the end of the standard input is reached.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line as a test case.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k` using `map(int, s.split())`.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **If `k >= 2`**:
     - **If `n == k`**:
       - The program prints an array of `n` elements, all equal to `k`. This is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of an array with identical elements are sorted.
     - **Otherwise**:
       - The program prints `-1`. This is incorrect because there can be valid arrays for `k >= 2` and `n != k`. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.
   - **If `k < 2`**:
     - The program prints an array of `n` elements, where each element is `j + 1` for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`. This is a valid solution because for `k = 1`, the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is itself.
     - For `k = 0`, the program should print `-1` because it is impossible to have an array with no sorted cyclic shifts. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

### Conclusion:
- The program fails to handle the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` correctly.
- The program also does not handle the case where `k = 0` correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, we need to handle the cases where `k >= 2` and `n != k` correctly, and also handle the case where `k = 0`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k == 0:
            print('-1')
        elif k == 1:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
        elif k == n:
            print(*[k for j in range(n)])
        elif k < n:
            # Create an array with k-1 elements in increasing order and the rest in decreasing order
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(k - 1)] + [n] + [j + 1 for j in range(n - k, 0, -1)])
        else:
            print('-1')
```

This corrected version handles all cases correctly:
- For `k = 0`, it prints `-1`.
- For `k = 1`, it prints the array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- For `k = n`, it prints an array with all elements equal to `k`.
- For `1 < k < n`, it prints an array with the first `k-1` elements in increasing order, followed by the largest element, and then the remaining elements in decreasing order. This ensures exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
