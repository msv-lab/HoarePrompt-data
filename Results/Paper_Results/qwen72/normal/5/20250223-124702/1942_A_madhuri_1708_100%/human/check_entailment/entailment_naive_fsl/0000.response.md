Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails when `k == 1` and `n > 1`. According to the problem description, for `k == 1`, there should be exactly one sorted cyclic shift of the array. However, the program prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` when `k == 1`, which is not guaranteed to have exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

For example, consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 1`. The program will output `1 2 3 4`. The cyclic shifts of this array are:
- `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (sorted)
- `[2, 3, 4, 1]` (not sorted)
- `[3, 4, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
- `[4, 1, 2, 3]` (not sorted)

This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is correct. However, for `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the program will output `1 2 3`. The cyclic shifts of this array are:
- `[1, 2, 3]` (sorted)
- `[2, 3, 1]` (not sorted)
- `[3, 1, 2]` (not sorted)

This array also has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is correct. However, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program incorrectly prints `-1` when it should be possible to find an array with exactly two sorted cyclic shifts. For example, the array `[1, 1, 2]` has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts:
- `[1, 1, 2]` (sorted)
- `[1, 2, 1]` (not sorted)
- `[2, 1, 1]` (sorted)

Thus, the program is incorrect for the case where `k == 2` and `n > 2`.
