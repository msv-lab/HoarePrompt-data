### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should take `n` and `k` as parameters.
   - The function reads from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which is a way to read lines from the input. However, this approach is not typical and might be confusing. A more standard approach would be to use `input()` or `sys.stdin`.

2. **Logic for Generating the Array:**
   - The function checks if `k >= 2`:
     - If `n == k`, it prints a list of `k` integers each equal to `k`. This is incorrect because the problem requires the array to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, and this approach will always produce an array with `n` sorted cyclic shifts, not `k`.
     - If `n != k`, it prints `-1`. This is also incorrect because it fails to consider cases where `k` is less than `n` but still valid.
   - If `k < 2`, it prints a list of integers from 1 to `n`. This is correct for the case where `k == 1` because the array will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The function processes multiple test cases correctly by reading each line from the input and splitting it into `n` and `k`.

4. **Correct Solution:**
   - For `k == 1`, the array can be constructed as `[1, 2, ..., n-1, n]` because the only sorted cyclic shift is the original array.
   - For `k == n`, the array can be constructed as `[1, 1, ..., 1]` because all cyclic shifts will be sorted.
   - For `1 < k < n`, the array can be constructed as `[1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2]` where the first `n - k + 1` elements are `1` and the remaining `k - 1` elements are `2`. This ensures that there are exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def find_array(n, k):
    if k == 1:
        # For k == 1, the array [1, 2, ..., n] will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift.
        print(*[i + 1 for i in range(n)])
    elif k == n:
        # For k == n, the array [1, 1, ..., 1] will have all cyclic shifts sorted.
        print(*[1 for _ in range(n)])
    elif 1 < k < n:
        # For 1 < k < n, the array [1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2] will have exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.
        print(*[1] * (n - k + 1) + [2] * (k - 1))
    else:
        print(-1)

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    find_array(n, k)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Function Definition:** The function `find_array` now takes `n` and `k` as parameters.
- **Case Handling:**
  - If `k == 1`, the array is constructed as `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
  - If `k == n`, the array is constructed as `[1, 1, ..., 1]`.
  - If `1 < k < n`, the array is constructed as `[1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2]` with `n - k + 1` ones and `k - 1` twos.
- **Input Handling:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` and calling `find_array`.

This corrected program should now correctly handle all test cases as described in the problem.
