Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. The program's logic is based on the following observations:

1. **Initial Connectivity**: Initially, every island is connected to every other island, forming a complete graph.
2. **Bridge Destruction**: Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.
3. **Island 1 as the Starting Point**: Everule starts on island 1 and can visit any other island through a series of bridges.

The key insight is:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it from the rest of the islands. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1, so the output is `1`.
- If `k` is less than `n - 1`, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely. Everule will still be able to visit all `n` islands, either directly or through a series of bridges. Therefore, the output is `n`.

The program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and prints `1` if true.
- Otherwise, it prints `n`.

This logic aligns with the problem description and the provided examples. The program handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
