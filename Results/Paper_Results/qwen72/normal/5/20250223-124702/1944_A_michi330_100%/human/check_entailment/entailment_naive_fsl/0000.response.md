Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n - 1` but still large enough to isolate some islands. For example, consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 3`. According to the problem description, Dominater can destroy 3 bridges in such a way that Everule can only visit 2 islands (including island 1). However, the program will output `5` in this case, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because Everule can be isolated from 3 of the 4 other islands by destroying 3 bridges.
