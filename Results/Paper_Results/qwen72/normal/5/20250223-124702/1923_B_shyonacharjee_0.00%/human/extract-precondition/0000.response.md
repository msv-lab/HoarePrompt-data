The provided function definition is incomplete for the problem described. However, based on the problem description, a more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def can_survive(t, cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing the parameters for a test case: `(n, k, a, x)`, where `n` is the number of monsters, `k` is the number of bullets you can fire per second, `a` is a list of integers representing the health of each monster, and `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster.

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four elements: (n, k, a, x), n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
