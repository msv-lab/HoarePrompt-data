Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains four elements: (n, k, a, x), n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
