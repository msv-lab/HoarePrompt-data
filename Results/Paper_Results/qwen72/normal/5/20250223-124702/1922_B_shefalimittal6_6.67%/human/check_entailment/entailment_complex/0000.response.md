Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and the list of exponents `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: The function uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent. This is a correct approach to keep track of how many sticks of each length are available.

3. **Triangle Formation**:
   - **Three Sticks of the Same Length**: The function correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. This is valid because if there are `cnt` sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 3 of them is `cnt choose 3`.
   - **Two Sticks of the Same Length and One Different**: The function also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. It uses `math.comb(cnt, 2)` to choose 2 sticks of the same length and multiplies it by the total number of sticks of different lengths (`total_sum`).

4. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the correct way to output the results as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n < 3`, the function will not enter the loops where it calculates combinations, and it will correctly print `0` for such cases.
   - The function handles the case where there are no sticks of the same length correctly by not adding any combinations to `res`.

6. **Efficiency**: The function is efficient enough to handle the constraints. It processes each test case in linear time relative to `n`, and the combination calculations are done in constant time for each unique exponent.

7. **Correctness of Triangle Inequality**:
   - The function implicitly uses the triangle inequality theorem by only considering combinations of sticks of the same length or two sticks of the same length and one different. This is because for a triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. For sticks of lengths \(2^a\), \(2^a\), and \(2^b\) (where \(a \neq b\)), the inequality \(2^a + 2^a > 2^b\) holds if and only if \(2^{a+1} > 2^b\), which simplifies to \(a + 1 > b\). Since \(a \leq b\), this condition is always true when \(a = b\). For three sticks of the same length, the inequality \(2^a + 2^a > 2^a\) is always true.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
