Output State: **The function should take two parameters: `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the exponents of the stick lengths. `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5.**
