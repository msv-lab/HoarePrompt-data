You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The length of test_cases is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    #State: `results` is a list containing the results of each test case, where each result is the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect square. The lengths of the sticks are determined by 2 raised to the power of the exponents given in each test case. The length of `results` is equal to the number of test cases, and each element in `results` corresponds to the respective test case in `test_cases`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `results` list remains unchanged, and each element in `results` is printed to the console in sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. It processes each test case to calculate the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect square. The lengths of the sticks are determined by 2 raised to the power of the exponents given in each test case. After processing all test cases, it prints each result to the console in sequence. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the state by printing the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the lengths of the sticks are such that no three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the program does not check the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
The lengths of the sticks are \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^2 = 4\). According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick. However, \(1 + 2 = 3\) is not greater than \(4\), so these sticks cannot form a non-degenerate triangle. The program, however, does not account for this and will incorrectly count this as a valid triangle.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Count the number of sticks of each length.
2. Check all possible combinations of three sticks to ensure they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.
3. Count only those combinations that form a non-degenerate triangle.

The current program does not perform the triangle inequality check, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
