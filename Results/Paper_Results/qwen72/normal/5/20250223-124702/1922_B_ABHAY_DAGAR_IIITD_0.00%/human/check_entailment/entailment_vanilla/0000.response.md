### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length `a_i`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program iterates over the counts of each unique stick length.
   - For each count `cnt`:
     - If `cnt` is at least 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \) and adds this to the result `res`.
     - If `cnt` is at least 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times \text{total_count} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times \text{total_count} \) and adds this to the result `res`.
     - It updates the `total_count` with the current count `cnt`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result `res` to the `results` list for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

### Analysis of the Triangle Formation Condition:
- For three sticks with lengths \( 2^{a_i} \), \( 2^{a_j} \), and \( 2^{a_k} \) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the triangle inequality must hold:
  - \( 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k} \)
  - \( 2^{a_i} + 2^{a_k} > 2^{a_j} \)
  - \( 2^{a_j} + 2^{a_k} > 2^{a_i} \)
- Given that the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to satisfy the triangle inequality is if two of the lengths are the same and the third is smaller. This is because \( 2^a + 2^a = 2^{a+1} \), which is always greater than any \( 2^b \) where \( b < a+1 \).

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the counting of stick lengths and the calculation of the number of valid triangles.
- It correctly accounts for the cases where:
  - Three sticks of the same length can form a triangle.
  - Two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length can form a triangle.
- The program correctly updates the `total_count` to ensure that the calculation for the second case (two sticks of the same length and one of a different length) is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
