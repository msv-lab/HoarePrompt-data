### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length in `num_list`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - It also initializes `total_count` to 0, which will keep track of the total number of sticks processed so far.
   - For each unique stick length `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `cnt` is at least 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \(\binom{cnt}{3}\) and adds it to `res`.
     - If `cnt` is at least 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \(\binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count\) and adds it to `res`.
     - It updates `total_count` by adding the current `cnt`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Non-degenerate Triangle Condition:**
  - For three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
  - Given that the stick lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if the three sticks have the same length. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 will never be greater than a larger power of 2 (e.g., \(2^a + 2^b < 2^c\) if \(a, b < c\)).

- **Combination Calculations:**
  - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using \(\binom{cnt}{3}\).
  - It also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using \(\binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count\).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks of the same length by not adding any combinations to `res`.
  - It also handles the case where there are no valid triangles by printing 0.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle from the given sticks. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
