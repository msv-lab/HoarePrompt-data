Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. It processes each test case to calculate the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect square. The lengths of the sticks are determined by 2 raised to the power of the exponents given in each test case. After processing all test cases, it prints each result to the console in sequence. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the state by printing the results. **
