You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

It constructs an undirected graph from a list of weighted edges and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find and union components of the graph. After processing, it prints the minimum edge weight that was successfully added to the DSU and the length of a list `res` obtained from a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a specific node. It also prints the elements of `res`. The final state of the program includes the original `n` and `m` values, a `graph` representing the constructed undirected graph, a sorted `edges` list, an updated `dsu` instance, and the printed values.

If a neighbor `nei` is not already fully processed (i.e., `colors[nei] != 2`) and is not the parent vertex, the loop will call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`. If the result of the `dfs` call is not `None` and contains `node_v`, the loop will return this result. If no such result is found, the loop will complete all iterations, and the state of `curr`, `parent`, and `path` will remain unchanged.
    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
    #The program returns an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function marks the current vertex as being visited and appends it to the path. If the current vertex has already been visited (i.e., its color is 1), the function returns the current path. Otherwise, it recursively explores all unvisited neighbors of the current vertex, excluding the parent vertex. If a neighbor's path contains a specific node `node_v`, the function returns that path. If no such path is found, the function marks the current vertex as fully processed and returns an empty list.

        func_6()
        
    #State: `test_cases` remains the same as the result of `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a number of test cases by calling `func_1()`, and then iterates that many times, calling `func_6()` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, and the function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where it identifies a simple cycle with the minimum weight edge. The issue lies in the logic of the `func_6` function, specifically in the way it processes the edges and updates the minimum edge weight.

1. **Edge Processing and Union-Find**: The program uses a union-find (DSU) data structure to detect cycles. However, it processes the edges in descending order of weight, which is incorrect for finding the cycle with the minimum weight edge. The correct approach would be to process the edges in ascending order of weight to ensure that the first cycle detected has the minimum weight edge.

2. **Cycle Detection and Path Construction**: The `dfs` function is used to construct the cycle path, but it does not correctly handle the cycle detection. The condition `if colors[curr] == 1:` is used to detect a cycle, but it does not ensure that the cycle is simple (i.e., it does not pass through the same vertex twice). Additionally, the logic to return the cycle path is flawed, as it may return a path that does not form a simple cycle.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
1
4 5
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
4 1 4
1 3 5
```

In this graph, the edges are:
- 1-2 with weight 1
- 2-3 with weight 2
- 3-4 with weight 3
- 4-1 with weight 4
- 1-3 with weight 5

The correct output should be:
```
1 4
1 2 3 4
```

However, the program will process the edges in descending order of weight and may incorrectly identify a cycle with a higher minimum weight edge. For example, it might detect the cycle 1-3-4-1 with the minimum weight edge 3, instead of the correct cycle 1-2-3-4 with the minimum weight edge 1.

To fix this, the program should process the edges in ascending order of weight and correctly handle the cycle detection and path construction to ensure that the cycle is simple.
