Output State: **`n` and `m` remain unchanged, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each key has a list of nodes it is connected to, `edges` is now a sorted list of tuples in descending order based on the edge weights, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with updated parent and min_edge values, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight that was successfully added to the DSU, `node_u` is the node u of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully added to the DSU, `node_v` is the node v of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully added to the DSU, `colors` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The `dfs` function is called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.
- The result of this function call is stored in the variable `res`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, `node_v`, `colors`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `res` depends on the implementation of the `dfs` function, which is not provided, so we can only state that `res` holds the result of the `dfs` function.
