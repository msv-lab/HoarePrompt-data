The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function marks the current vertex as being visited and appends it to the path. If the current vertex has already been visited (i.e., its color is 1), the function returns the current path. Otherwise, it recursively explores all unvisited neighbors of the current vertex, excluding the parent vertex. If a neighbor's path contains a specific node `node_v`, the function returns that path. If no such path is found, the function marks the current vertex as fully processed and returns an empty list.
