The function `func_6` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `graph`, and `edges`. `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). `graph` is a defaultdict of lists representing an undirected graph. `edges` is a list of tuples (w, u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, u != v, and 1 <= w <= 10^6. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `graph`, and `edges`. It processes these inputs to return a result, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
