### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_3` reads the number of vertices and edges for each test case.
   - `func_3` is used again to read the edges and their weights for each test case.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - `func_6` constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists and stores the edges in a list.
   - It sorts the edges in descending order of their weights to ensure that the lightest edges are considered last during the union process.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Data Structure:**
   - The `DSU` class is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `find` method is used to find the root of a vertex.
   - The `union` method is used to union two components and update the minimum edge weight of the resulting component.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - `func_6` iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the two vertices of an edge are already in the same component), it updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.
   - The cycle detection logic is correct because it ensures that the lightest edge in the cycle is the one that was added last, which is the smallest weight edge.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the cycle in the graph.
   - It marks nodes as visited and explores their neighbors.
   - If a node is revisited (i.e., its color is 1), it returns the current path, which represents a cycle.
   - The function ensures that the cycle includes the specific nodes `node_u` and `node_v` that were part of the cycle detected by the DSU.

6. **Output:**
   - `func_6` prints the minimum edge weight and the length of the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
- **Cycle Detection Logic:** The cycle detection logic in `func_6` is incorrect. It should detect cycles when the two vertices of an edge are in the same component before the union, not after. The current implementation updates the union and then checks for cycles, which is not the correct approach.
- **DFS Initialization:** The `dfs` function is called with `node_u` and `node_v` which are not initialized correctly in `func_6`. The `dfs` function should be called with a node that is part of the cycle, and the `node_v` should be used to check if the cycle includes the specific node.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly find the simple cycle with the minimal lightest edge. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
