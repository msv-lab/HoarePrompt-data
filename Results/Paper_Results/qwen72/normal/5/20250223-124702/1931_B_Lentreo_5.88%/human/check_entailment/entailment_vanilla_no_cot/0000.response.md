Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic implemented in the program is flawed and does not check if it is possible to equalize the water levels in all containers by pouring water from any container to a container with a higher index.

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Equalization Check**: The program calculates the difference between each element and the last element in the list and sums these differences. This does not correctly determine if the water levels can be equalized. The correct approach involves checking if the water can be redistributed such that each container ends up with the average amount of water.

2. **Average Calculation**: The program does not calculate the average amount of water that each container should have after equalization. This is a crucial step in determining if the water can be redistributed.

3. **Redistribution Feasibility**: The program does not check if the water can be poured from a container with more water to a container with less water, ensuring that the water levels can be equalized. This is a key requirement of the problem.

A correct solution would involve:

1. Calculating the average amount of water that each container should have.
2. Checking if the water can be poured from containers with more water to containers with less water to achieve this average.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Calculate the average amount of water
        avg = sum(nums) // n
        
        # Check if the water can be poured to achieve the average
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if nums[i] > avg:
                nums[i + 1] += nums[i] - avg
                nums[i] = avg
        
        # If the last container has the average amount of water, it's possible
        if nums[-1] == avg:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the water is poured from each container to the next one until all containers have the average amount of water. If the last container ends up with the average amount of water, it means the water can be equalized, and the program outputs "YES". Otherwise, it outputs "NO".
