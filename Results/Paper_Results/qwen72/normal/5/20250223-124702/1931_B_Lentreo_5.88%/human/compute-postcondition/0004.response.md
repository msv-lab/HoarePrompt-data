Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. For each test case, it calculates the difference between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`, summing these differences. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes `t` test cases, and after processing all test cases, the value of `t` is reduced to zero. The initial list `a` mentioned in the annotations is not used or modified by the function. **
