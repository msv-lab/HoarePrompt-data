Output State: **The value of `t` is reduced by the number of iterations that have been completed, and `n` and `nums` are updated based on the input provided during each iteration. The variables `last` and `curr` are used within each iteration and reset at the start of each new iteration. The final output for each iteration is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `curr == 0`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.**
