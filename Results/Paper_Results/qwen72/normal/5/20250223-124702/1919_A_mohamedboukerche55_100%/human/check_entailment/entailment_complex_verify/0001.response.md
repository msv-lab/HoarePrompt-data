### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is essentially a sequence of moves where each player must reduce the number of coins in their wallet by one.
   - The total number of coins in both wallets combined is \( a + b \).
   - Each turn, one coin is removed, so the total number of moves that can be made is \( a + b - 1 \) (since the last coin cannot be removed).

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If the total number of moves \( a + b - 1 \) is even, then Bob will make the last move and Alice will lose.
   - If the total number of moves \( a + b - 1 \) is odd, then Alice will make the last move and Bob will lose.
   - This can be simplified to checking if \( (a + b) \% 2 == 0 \):
     - If true, Bob wins.
     - If false, Alice wins.

4. **Reviewing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It then checks if the sum \( a + b \) is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

5. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the program is correct. It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of \( a + b \).
   - The program uses the modulo operator to check the parity, which is the correct approach.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( a \) and \( b \) are both 1 correctly (Bob wins).
   - It also handles larger values of \( a \) and \( b \) correctly, as the modulo operation is valid for large integers.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function should take two integers \( a \) and \( b \) as input, where \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9 \), representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
  - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \) and iterates over each test case.

- **Inside the loop:**
  - The program reads the input for each test case and splits it into two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
  - It then checks the parity of \( a + b \) using the modulo operator.
  - If \( (a + b) \% 2 == 0 \), it prints "Bob".
  - If \( (a + b) \% 2 != 0 \), it prints "Alice".

- **State after the loop:**
  - The values of \( a \) and \( b \) will be the last input values provided in the loop.
  - The value of \( t \) remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is correct and aligns with the problem description. The modulo operation is the appropriate method to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The program handles all edge cases and valid inputs correctly.

Final: **True**
