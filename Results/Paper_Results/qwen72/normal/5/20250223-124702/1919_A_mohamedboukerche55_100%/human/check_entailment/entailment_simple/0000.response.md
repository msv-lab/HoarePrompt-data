Reasoning:  
The program provided is intended to solve the problem by determining the winner of the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. However, the logic used in the program is flawed. The program checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd and decides the winner based on that. This approach does not correctly model the game's rules, which involve players taking turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The correct approach to determine the winner is to consider the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins in the wallets. The key observation is that the player with the odd number of coins will always be able to force the other player into a losing position. Here's why:

- If both players have an even number of coins, the first player (Alice) will always be able to force the second player (Bob) into a position where Bob has an odd number of coins, and Alice can then always make a move that keeps Bob in a losing position.
- If both players have an odd number of coins, the first player (Alice) will always be able to force the second player (Bob) into a position where Bob has an even number of coins, and Alice can then always make a move that keeps Bob in a losing position.
- If one player has an even number of coins and the other has an odd number of coins, the player with the odd number of coins can always force the other player into a losing position by ensuring that the other player is left with an even number of coins after each turn.

The program's logic of checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd does not capture this correct strategy. Instead, the program should check the parity of the number of coins in each wallet and determine the winner based on that.

Given the correct logic, the program should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(s.split()[0])
        b = int(s.split()[1])
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This corrected program checks the parity of `a` and `b` and determines the winner based on the correct game strategy.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
