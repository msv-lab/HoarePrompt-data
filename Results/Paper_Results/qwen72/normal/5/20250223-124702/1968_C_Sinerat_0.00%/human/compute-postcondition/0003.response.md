Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` of length `n-1`. It then constructs a list `a` of length `n`, where `a[0]` is initialized to 500, and for each `1 <= i < n`, `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of `a[0]` and the elements `x[1]` to `x[i-1]`. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` are not modified by the function. **
