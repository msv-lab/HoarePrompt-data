### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`:**
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice because \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) and 500 is within this range.

2. **Construction of `a[i]` for \(1 \le i \le n\):**
   - The program constructs the array `a` such that \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\) for \(1 \le i \le n\).
   - This construction ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) because \(a_i\) is exactly \(a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\), and the remainder when \(a_i\) is divided by \(a_{i-1}\) is \(x_{i-1}\).

3. **Checking the conditions:**
   - For each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) must hold.
   - Given \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\), the remainder when \(a_i\) is divided by \(a_{i-1}\) is \(x_{i-1}\), which matches the given \(x_i\).

4. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and the array \(x\), constructs the array \(a\) as described, and prints it.
   - The output format is correct, as it prints the array \(a\) for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \(n = 2\). In this case, it will correctly set \(a[0] = 500\) and \(a[1] = 500 + x[0]\), ensuring the condition \(x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1\) is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array \(a\) based on the given conditions and handles all edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
