You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: The variable `loop` is decremented by the number of iterations executed, and the variable `num` holds the first integer that satisfies the conditions for each test case (i.e., it is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, less than the minimum value in `less`, and not in `no`). The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` are reset to empty for each iteration of the outer loop. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and the constraints remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of constraints for each test case. It also reads the constraints and categorizes them into `big`, `less`, and `no` lists based on their types.

2. **Constraint Categorization**:
   - `big` list stores the values for which `k` must be greater than or equal to.
   - `less` list stores the values for which `k` must be less than or equal to.
   - `no` list stores the values for which `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Range Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the range of possible values for `k` using `max(big)` and `min(less)`. This is correct because `k` must be at least as large as the largest value in `big` and at most as large as the smallest value in `less`.

4. **Exclusion of Forbidden Values**:
   - The program then iterates through the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` and checks if each value is in the `no` list. If a value is not in the `no` list, it assigns this value to `num` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the first valid `k` found. However, this is incorrect because the problem requires the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, not just the first valid `k`.

6. **Logical Error**:
   - The program does not count the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. Instead, it only finds the first valid integer and prints it, which does not meet the problem's requirements.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where there are no valid integers `k` (e.g., when `max(big) > min(less)`). In such cases, the program should print `0`, but it does not.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
