Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to split a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' into subarrays.
   - The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the string.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` (which is not used) and the string `s`.
   - It initializes two counters `P` and `M` to count the number of '+' and '-' characters, respectively.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and increments `P` for each '+' and `M` for each '-'.
   - Finally, it prints `P - M`.

3. **Identifying the Issue**:
   - The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the entire string.
   - This difference is not the same as the minimum possible penalty.
   - The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program does not consider the optimal way to split the string into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To minimize the total penalty, we should split the string such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - If the sum of a subarray is zero, its penalty is zero.
   - If the sum is non-zero, the penalty is the absolute value of the sum multiplied by the length of the subarray.
   - The optimal way to split the string is to split it at every change from '+' to '-' or vice versa, ensuring that each subarray has a sum of zero or the smallest possible non-zero sum.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not implement the correct logic to minimize the total penalty.
   - It simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the minimum possible penalty.
   - The program fails to account for the optimal splitting of the string into subarrays.

Correctness: **False**
