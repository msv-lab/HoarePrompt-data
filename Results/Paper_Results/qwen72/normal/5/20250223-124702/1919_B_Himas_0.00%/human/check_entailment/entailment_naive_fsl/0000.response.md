Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array optimally. Instead, it calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the required output.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
The expected output is `0` because the array can be split into subarrays with sums that cancel each other out, resulting in a penalty of `0`. However, the program will output `0` by simply calculating the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `0` in this case. While this happens to be correct for this specific input, it does not handle other cases correctly.

Another example:
```
1
5
++---
```
The expected output is `1` because the optimal split is `([+],[+],[-,-,-])`, resulting in penalties `1 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 3 * 1 = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5`, but the program will output `1 - 3 = -2`, which is incorrect.

The program fails to handle the requirement of splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. Therefore, it is incorrect.
