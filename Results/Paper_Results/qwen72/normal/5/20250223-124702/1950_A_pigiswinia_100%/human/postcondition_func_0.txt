The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last test case.
