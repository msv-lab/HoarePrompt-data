Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input. This is done using `t = int(input())`, which is correct for reading a single integer.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct because it splits the input string into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. **Stair Condition**: The program checks if the digits form a stair using the condition `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR". This is correct according to the problem description.

5. **Peak Condition**: The program checks if the digits form a peak using the condition `a < b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK". This is also correct according to the problem description.

6. **Neither Condition**: If neither the stair nor the peak condition is met, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct fallback condition.

7. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, which matches the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly handles the input, processes the conditions, and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
