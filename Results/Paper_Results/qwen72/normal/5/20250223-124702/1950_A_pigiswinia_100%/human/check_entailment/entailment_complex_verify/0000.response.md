### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that the input is split into three integers and is appropriate for the problem constraints.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "stair". This condition is correctly implemented and will print "STAIR" if true.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a "peak". This condition is also correctly implemented and will print "PEAK" if true.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This covers all other cases, including when the digits are equal or do not form a valid "stair" or "peak".

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case as required. The output is directly printed to the console, which is consistent with the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal (e.g., 0 0 0), or when the digits do not form a "stair" or "peak" (e.g., 4 1 7). In these cases, it correctly prints "NONE".

5. **State Management:**
   - The annotated code correctly states that the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated with the values from each test case during each iteration. This is expected behavior and does not affect the correctness of the program.
   - The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the function, which is also correct as it is only used to determine the number of test cases.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a "stair", "peak", or neither, and it handles all edge cases within the given constraints.

Final: **True**
