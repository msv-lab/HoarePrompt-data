You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases t is a positive integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop will print 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each test case based on the conditions specified. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated with the values from each test case during each iteration, but their final values will be the values from the last test case. The variable `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles all potential cases based on the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by checking the conditions for a "stair" (a < b < c) and a "peak" (a < b > c), and outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" accordingly. The logic is straightforward and covers all edge cases within the given constraints (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9). No potential input will cause the program to produce an incorrect output.
