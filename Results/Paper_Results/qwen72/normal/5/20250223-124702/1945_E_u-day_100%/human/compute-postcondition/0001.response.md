Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is the index of `k` in the new `arr` such that 0 <= `pos` < `n` if `k` is in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is undefined.** 

In natural language: The values of `n` and `k` remain as they were updated by `func_1()`. The list `arr` is now updated to the values returned by `func_2()`. The variable `pos` is still the index of `k` in `arr`, but since `arr` has changed, `pos` will be recalculated based on the new `arr`. If `k` is not in the new `arr`, `pos` will be undefined.
