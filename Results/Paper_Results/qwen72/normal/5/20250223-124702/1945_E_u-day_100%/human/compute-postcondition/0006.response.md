Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set `st`, but does not change the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid, and `st` is now an empty set.
