Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1.**

The value of `pos` is set to -1, indicating that it is no longer the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` was previously in `arr`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `arr`) remain as they were, with `n` and `k` holding the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` being the list of values returned by `func_2()`.
