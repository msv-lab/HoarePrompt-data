You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.
