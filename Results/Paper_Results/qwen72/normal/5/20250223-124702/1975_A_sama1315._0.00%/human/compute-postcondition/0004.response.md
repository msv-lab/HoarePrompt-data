Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is 1, `t` is now equal to the integer value of `data[0]`.**
