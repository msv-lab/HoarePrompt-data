Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is equal to the length of `data`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element is the result of calling `func_1` on a list of integers.**
