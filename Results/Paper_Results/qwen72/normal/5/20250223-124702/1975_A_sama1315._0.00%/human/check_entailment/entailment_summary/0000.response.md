Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them. The provided functions do not fully address this requirement. 

- `func_1` checks if the array is already non-decreasing. This is not sufficient because the array might not be non-decreasing initially but could become non-decreasing after one or more swaps.
- `func_2` reads the input, processes it to extract multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case. However, since `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, `func_2` will incorrectly output "No" for arrays that can be sorted by the allowed operation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Check if the array is already non-decreasing.
2. If not, find a split point where the array can be divided into two parts such that when swapped, the resulting array is non-decreasing.

The current implementation does not perform the second step, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
