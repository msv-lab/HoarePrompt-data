The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the built-in `input` function to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`. This change affects the `input` variable, but it does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6, `input` is now the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.**
