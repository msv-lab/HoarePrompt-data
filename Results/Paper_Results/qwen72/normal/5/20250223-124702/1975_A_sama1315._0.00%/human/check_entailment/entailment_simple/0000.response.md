Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix) any number of times, not just if it is already sorted.
   - The function `func_1` does not implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted by the specified operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length `n` of each array.
   - It correctly reads the array elements and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are collected and printed correctly.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program is also incorrect.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - To determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operation, we need to check if there exists a split point such that the prefix and suffix, when swapped, form a non-decreasing array.
   - This can be done by finding the point where the array breaks the non-decreasing order, and then checking if the array can be split at that point and the resulting arrays can be concatenated to form a non-decreasing array.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because `func_1` does not implement the required logic to check if the array can be sorted by the specified operation.

Correctness: **False**
