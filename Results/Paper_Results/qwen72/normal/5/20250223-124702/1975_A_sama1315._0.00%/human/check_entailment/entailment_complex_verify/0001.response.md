### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` positive integers.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times.
   - The operation involves splitting the array into a prefix `x` and a suffix `y`, and then swapping them to form `y + x`.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(arr)` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' if there is any element that is greater than the next element.
   - However, this function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation.
   - The function `func_1` is indeed incorrect for the given problem because it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not handle the required operation.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It calls `func_1(arr)` to check if the array can be sorted.
   - It appends the result to a list `results` and prints all results at the end.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results for some test cases.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation.
   - Therefore, `func_1` is incorrect for the given problem because it does not handle the required operation.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
   - It uses `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted, but since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results for some test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation. Therefore, the program will fail to correctly determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order for some test cases.

Final: **False**
