Reasoning:  
The program's logic is designed to check if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) by following the rules of movement. However, there are a few issues with the logic that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Movement**: The program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement as described in the problem. The robot should move left, right, down, or up, and then follow the arrow in the current cell. The current logic only checks if the robot can move to the next cell based on the arrow direction, but it does not simulate the actual movement sequence.

2. **State Management**: The program uses `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track if the robot can reach the end of the second row. However, these variables are not managed correctly. For example, if the robot moves from the first row to the second row, the program should update the state to reflect that the robot is now in the second row and can move accordingly.

3. **Termination Condition**: The program does not correctly handle the termination condition. The robot should be able to reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows, but the current logic does not ensure that the robot can move to the end of the second row.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the robot is stuck in a loop or when the arrows do not allow the robot to move to the next cell.

Given these issues, the program is not correct and will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
