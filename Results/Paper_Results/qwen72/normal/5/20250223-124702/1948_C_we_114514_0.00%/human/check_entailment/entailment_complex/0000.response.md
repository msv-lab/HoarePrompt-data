Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the grid dimensions `n` and the arrow directions for the two rows. These inputs are stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the number of test cases `t` and the list of tuples `test_cases`. This is appropriate because the function needs to process each test case.

3. **Initialization**: Inside `func_1`, the program initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`. This is correct because the robot starts in the first row and has not yet reached the second row.

4. **Loop Through Columns**: The program iterates through each column of the grid. The logic for determining if the robot can move to the next column or to the second row is as follows:
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the right (`>`), the robot can move to the next cell in the first row.
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the left (`<`), the robot cannot move to the next cell in the first row, so it sets `reachable_first_row` to `False`.
     - If the robot is at the last column and the arrow points to the right, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating it can move to the second row).
     - If the robot is not at the last column and the arrow in the second row points to the right, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating it can move to the second row).
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the current cell points to the right (`>`), the robot can move to the next cell in the second row.
     - If the robot is at the last column and the arrow points to the right, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating it can move to the end of the second row).

5. **Output**: After processing all columns, the program appends 'YES' to the results list if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, otherwise it appends 'NO'. This is correct because it indicates whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the constraints correctly, including the evenness of `n` and the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^5.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:
- The program does not correctly handle the transition from the first row to the second row when the robot is not at the last column. Specifically, it should check if the robot can move to the second row from the first row and then continue moving in the second row.

To fix this, the program should:
- Check if the robot can move to the second row from the first row when it encounters a left arrow in the first row.
- Continue moving in the second row if the robot has moved to the second row.

Here is the corrected version of the loop:

```python
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
                reachable_first_row = False  # Ensure the robot moves to the second row
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_second_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row1[j] == '>':
                reachable_first_row = True
                reachable_second_row = False  # Ensure the robot moves back to the first row
```

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly handle the transition between rows, which can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
