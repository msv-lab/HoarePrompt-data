The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `n` is even) and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` which contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to reach the end of the second row from the start of the first row for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list `results` with 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to navigate from the start of the first row to the end of the second row based on the arrow directions.**
