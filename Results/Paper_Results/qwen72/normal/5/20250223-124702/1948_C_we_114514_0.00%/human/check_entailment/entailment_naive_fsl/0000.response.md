Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) in certain scenarios. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output from the program:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
In this case, the robot can follow the path:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2) (since the arrow at (1, 1) points right)
3. Move down to (2, 2) (since the arrow at (1, 2) points down)
4. Move right to (2, 3) (since the arrow at (2, 2) points right)
5. Move right to (2, 4) (since the arrow at (2, 3) points right)

Thus, the robot can reach the cell (2, 4), and the expected output should be "YES". However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not correctly handle the transitions between rows and columns in this specific scenario.
