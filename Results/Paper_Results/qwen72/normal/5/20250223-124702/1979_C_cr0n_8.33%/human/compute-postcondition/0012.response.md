The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided function signature. However, the description suggests that it should be designed to handle inputs `t`, `n`, and `k` as described in the parameter constraints. Since the function signature does not include these parameters, it is likely that they are handled internally or through some other means not shown in the function signature. The function returns nothing.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.**
