Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the multipliers are all the same and equal to 2. For example, consider the input:

```
1
3
2 2 2
```

In this case, the program will calculate the product of the multipliers as 8, and the bets as `[4, 4, 4]`. The sum of the bets is 12, and the product of the multipliers minus the sum of the bets is 8 - 12 = -4, which is less than or equal to 0. Therefore, the program will print `-1`, indicating that there is no solution. However, a valid solution exists: `[1, 1, 1]`. The total bet is 3, and for any winning outcome, the return is 2, which is strictly greater than 3. Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
