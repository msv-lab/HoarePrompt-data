Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` is a list of n integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from input, `prod` is 1.**

The variable `prod` is initialized to 1, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, and `vals` remain unchanged.
