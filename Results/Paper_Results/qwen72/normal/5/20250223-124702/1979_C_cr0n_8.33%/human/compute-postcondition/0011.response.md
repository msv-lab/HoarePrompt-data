To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
2. `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
3. `k` is a list of `n` integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
4. `N` is an input integer.
5. `vals` is a list of integers read from input.
6. `prod` is the product of all integers in `vals`.
7. `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all integers in `vals` except the corresponding integer in `vals`.
8. `den` is the value of `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`prod` Calculation**:
   - `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`.
   - For example, if `vals = [2, 3, 4]`, then `prod = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24`.

2. **`vprod` Calculation**:
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all integers in `vals` except the corresponding integer.
   - For the same example `vals = [2, 3, 4]`:
     - The first element of `vprod` is the product of `3 * 4 = 12`.
     - The second element of `vprod` is the product of `2 * 4 = 8`.
     - The third element of `vprod` is the product of `2 * 3 = 6`.
   - Therefore, `vprod = [12, 8, 6]`.

3. **`den` Calculation**:
   - `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - For the example `vals = [2, 3, 4]`:
     - `sum(vprod) = 12 + 8 + 6 = 26`.
     - `den = 24 - 26 = -2`.
   - However, the precondition states that `den` is greater than 0, so this example is not valid. We need to ensure that `den` is positive.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet `print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))` will print the elements of the list `vprod` separated by spaces.
   - Each element of `vprod` is converted to a string and then joined with spaces.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the elements of the list `vprod` separated by spaces. The exact values of `vprod` depend on the input list `vals`.

Output: **vprod (where vprod is a list of integers, each element being the product of all integers in vals except the corresponding integer in vals)**

For a specific example, if `vals = [2, 3, 4]` (and assuming `den` is positive, which it is not in this case but for the sake of understanding the format):
Output: **12 8 6**

However, without the exact values of `vals`, the most precise description is:
Output: **vprod (where vprod is a list of integers, each element being the product of all integers in vals except the corresponding integer in vals)**
