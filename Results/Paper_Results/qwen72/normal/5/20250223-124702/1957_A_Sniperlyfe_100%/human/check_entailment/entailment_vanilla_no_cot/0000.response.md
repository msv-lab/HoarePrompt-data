Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed, not the maximum number of regular polygons. The formula `(v // 3)` is used to determine how many groups of three sticks (triangles) can be formed from the sticks of the same length. However, the problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons, which can have any number of sides (3 or more), not just triangles.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider the possibility of forming polygons with more than three sides. For example, if there are 4 sticks of the same length, they can form a square, and if there are 5 sticks of the same length, they can form a pentagon, and so on. The correct approach would be to sum the number of polygons that can be formed for each stick length, where the number of polygons is given by `v // k` for each `k` in the range of 3 to `v` (where `v` is the frequency of a particular stick length).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    max_polygons = 0
    for v in freq.values():
        for k in range(3, v + 1):
            max_polygons += v // k
    return max_polygons
```

However, this approach is inefficient because it iterates over possible polygon sides for each stick length. A more efficient solution would be to directly calculate the maximum number of polygons for each stick length by dividing the frequency by the smallest possible number of sides (3) and then adjusting for larger polygons if necessary. Here is a more efficient and correct version:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    max_polygons = 0
    for v in freq.values():
        max_polygons += v // 3
    return max_polygons
```

This version is actually correct for the given problem, as it correctly counts the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by considering the minimum number of sides (3) for each group of sticks. However, the original program's output for the example cases is incorrect, which indicates a misunderstanding of the problem requirements. The correct output should be:

```
0
0
1
2
```

The original program would output:

```
0
0
1
3
```

This is because it counts the number of triangles, not the maximum number of regular polygons. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
