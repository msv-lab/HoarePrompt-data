Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of regular polygons with more than 3 sides. The function `func_1` only divides the frequency of each stick length by 3, which is only correct for triangles. For example, consider the input:

```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

The program will output `2`, indicating that 2 triangles can be formed. However, the correct output should be `1`, as 6 sticks of the same length can form a single hexagon. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides.
