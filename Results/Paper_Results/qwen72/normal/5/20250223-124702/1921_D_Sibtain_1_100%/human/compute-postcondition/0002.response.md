Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` and two lists `a_i` and `b_i` of integers. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
