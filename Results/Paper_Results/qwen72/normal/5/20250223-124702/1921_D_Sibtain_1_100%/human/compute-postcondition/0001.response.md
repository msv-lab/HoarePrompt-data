Output State: **For each test case, the loop will print the maximum possible sum of absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` and the reverse-sorted list `c`. If `a` and `c` are identical and contain only one unique value, the loop will print 0. If `a` contains only one element, the loop will print the maximum absolute difference between that element and the maximum or minimum element of `c`. The initial variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` will remain unchanged, but the loop will have processed all test cases.**
