Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a non-negative integer `t` representing the current time step in the game. It checks if any player's coordinates match the Bludger's coordinates. If a match is found, the player is marked as eliminated by setting their coordinates to `[-1, -1]`, and their identifier is added to a list. The function then prints the time step `t`, the player identifier, and the message 'ELIMINATED' for each eliminated player, in sorted order of the player identifiers. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `player` dictionary is updated with the new coordinates of the eliminated players, and the Bludger's coordinates remain unchanged. **
