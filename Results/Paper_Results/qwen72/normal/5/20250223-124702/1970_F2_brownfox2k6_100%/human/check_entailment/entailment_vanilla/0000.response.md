### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two teams (Red and Blue), a Quaffle, and a Bludger.
   - Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw the Quaffle.
   - The Bludger can eliminate players.
   - Scoring happens when a player leaves the Quaffle at the opponent's goal.
   - The Quaffle resets to the center of the field after a score.
   - The program should track the game, print events, and the final score.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **`func_1(obj, d)`**:
     - This function updates the position of an entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction `d`.
     - It correctly handles the movement in four directions (U, D, L, R).
   - **`func_2(t)`**:
     - This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
     - It correctly updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]` to indicate elimination.
     - It prints the elimination events in alphabetical order.

3. **Identifying Missing Components:**
   - The provided functions are incomplete and do not cover the entire logic of the game.
   - The main logic for handling the game steps, scoring, and Quaffle reset is missing.

4. **Expected Functionality:**
   - The program should:
     - Initialize the field with players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger.
     - Process each action step by step.
     - Check for scoring and elimination events.
     - Print the events and the final score.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The provided functions are not sufficient to handle the entire game logic.
   - There is no function to handle the Quaffle being caught or thrown.
   - There is no function to handle scoring and resetting the Quaffle.
   - The `player` and `blud` variables are not defined in the provided code.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incomplete and does not cover the full logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
