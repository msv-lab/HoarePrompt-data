Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `obj` of two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on a field, and a string `d` representing the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). It modifies the `obj` list in place to update the coordinates based on the direction: 'U' decreases the row coordinate by 1, 'D' increases the row coordinate by 1, 'L' decreases the column coordinate by 1, and 'R' increases the column coordinate by 1. If `d` is not one of these directions, `obj` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value. **
