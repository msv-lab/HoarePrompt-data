### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program correctly initializes the dimensions of the field (`n`, `m`), the positions of the red and blue goals (`rg`, `bg`), the initial position of the Quaffle (`ball`), the initial position of the Bludger (`blud`), and the initial positions of the players (`player`).
   - The variable `carry` is used to track which player is carrying the Quaffle, and `rs` and `bs` are used to track the scores of the red and blue teams, respectively.

2. **Action Processing:**
   - The program processes each action in the sequence provided by the input.
   - If the action is a catch (`C`), the program correctly updates the `carry` variable to indicate which player is now carrying the Quaffle.
   - If the action is a throw (`T`), the program correctly updates the `carry` variable to `None` and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If it is, the appropriate team's score is incremented, and the Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field.
   - If the action is a movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), the program correctly updates the position of the entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function correctly updates the coordinates of the entity based on the direction of movement.

3. **Bludger and Player Elimination:**
   - The `func_2` function is called after a player or the Bludger moves to check if any player has been eliminated by the Bludger.
   - The function correctly identifies players whose positions match the Bludger's position and marks them as eliminated by setting their coordinates to `[-1, -1]`.
   - The function then prints the elimination events in the correct order (alphabetical order of player identifiers).

4. **Scoring and Final Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the scoring events and the final score at the end of the game.
   - The scoring logic is correct: if a player carrying the Quaffle leaves it in the opponent's goal, the appropriate team's score is incremented.
   - The final score is printed in the required format.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle by leaving the Quaffle at the player's last position.
   - The program ensures that the Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, as required.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. It processes the actions, updates the positions, handles eliminations, and prints the scoring events and final score in the correct format. The logic and flow of the program are consistent with the requirements.
