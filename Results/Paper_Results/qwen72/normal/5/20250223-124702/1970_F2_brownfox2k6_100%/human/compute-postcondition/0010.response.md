Output State: **obj is a list of two integers representing the coordinates (row, column) of an entity on the field, where the column value is increased by 1; d is 'R'.** 

The column coordinate in the `obj` list is incremented by 1, while the row coordinate remains unchanged. The direction `d` is still 'R'. The conditions that `d` is not 'U', 'D', or 'L' remain valid.
