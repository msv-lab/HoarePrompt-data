To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`.

1. **`results`**: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.
2. **`result`**: This is the variable that will hold each element of `results` during each iteration. Before the loop starts, `result` is not defined, but it will be assigned the first element of `results` when the loop begins.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `input` is still a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.
- `data` is a list of strings split from the input read.
- `t` is equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`.
- `index` is equal to `1 + t * (1 + n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in each array processed in the loop.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.

The loop will execute if `results` is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element.

State: **`input` is still a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read, `t` is equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`, `index` is equal to `1 + t * (1 + n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in each array processed in the loop, `results` must contain at least one element, `result` is the first element in `results`**
