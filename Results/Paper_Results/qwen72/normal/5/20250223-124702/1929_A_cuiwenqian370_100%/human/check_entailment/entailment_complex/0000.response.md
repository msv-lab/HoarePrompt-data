Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key to maximizing the beauty is to maximize the difference between consecutive elements in the array. 

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order. This is a crucial step because sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which is the opposite of what we want. To maximize the beauty, we should actually sort the array in descending order.
- **Calculating the Beauty**: The function calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, since the array is sorted in ascending order, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will always be positive, and the sum will be the total difference between the smallest and largest elements in the array. This is not the maximum beauty, but the minimum beauty.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Reading Input**: The function `func_2` reads the input correctly, processes it to extract multiple arrays, and applies `func_1` to each array.
- **Output**: The function prints the results of `func_1` for each array, which is correct based on the structure of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` is incorrect because it sorts the array in ascending order, which minimizes the beauty instead of maximizing it. To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in descending order.

### Correct Solution:
To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in descending order, and then the beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

### Corrected `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort(reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i - 1] - array[i]
    return beauty
```

### Correctness:
Since the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly maximize the beauty, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
