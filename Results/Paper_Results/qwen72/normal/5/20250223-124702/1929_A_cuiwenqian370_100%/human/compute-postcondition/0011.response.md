Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple arrays, applies another function `func_1` to each array, and prints the results of these applications. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input state remains unchanged, and the results of `func_1` for each array are printed to the console. **
