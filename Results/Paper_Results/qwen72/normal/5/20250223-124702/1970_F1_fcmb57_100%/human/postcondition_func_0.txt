The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be odd integers between 3 and 99, inclusive. However, the function raises a TypeError because it attempts to unpack `a` and `b` into variables `x, y` and `dx, dy` respectively, but `b` is not a tuple and thus cannot be unpacked. As a result, the function does not return any valid output.
