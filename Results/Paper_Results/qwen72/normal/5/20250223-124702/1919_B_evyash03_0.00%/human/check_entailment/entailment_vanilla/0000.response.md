### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - The string `s` represents an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - We need to split `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

2. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**:
   - To minimize the penalty, we should try to balance the subarrays as much as possible, i.e., make the sum of each subarray as close to zero as possible.
   - If we can split the array such that the sum of each subarray is zero, the penalty for that subarray will be zero.
   - If we cannot achieve a sum of zero, we should try to minimize the absolute sum of the subarrays.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `expression`.
   - It splits the string `expression` by the character `-` and calculates the total length of the resulting parts.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the `expression` and `result_length`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes `count` and `balance` to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - If the character is `+`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
   - If the character is `-`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   - If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` by 1 and resets the `balance` to zero.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

5. **Correctness of the Splitting Logic**:
   - The program splits the string by `-` and calculates the total length of the resulting parts. However, this splitting logic is not necessary for the problem.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum penalty by maintaining a `balance` and counting the number of times the `balance` becomes negative.
   - The final return value `count + (balance > 0)` ensures that if there is a remaining positive balance, it is counted as one additional penalty.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For a string with only `+` or only `-`, the function correctly returns the length of the string.
   - For a balanced string (equal number of `+` and `-`), the function correctly returns 0.
   - For strings where the number of `+` and `-` are not equal, the function correctly counts the number of times the `balance` becomes negative and adds one if there is a remaining positive balance.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
