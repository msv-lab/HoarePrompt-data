### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to split the array `a` (derived from the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty for all possible splits.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then splits the string `s` by the character `-` and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `expression` and the sum of the lengths of the parts.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` variable that is incremented for `+` and decremented for `-`.
   - If the `balance` goes below 0, it increments a `count` variable and resets the `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns the `count` plus 1 if the final `balance` is greater than 0.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of times the balance goes below 0, which corresponds to the number of subarrays needed to reset the balance.
   - If the final balance is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the count, which accounts for the last subarray that has a positive balance.
   - This approach is correct because it ensures that each subarray has a sum of 0 or a single positive or negative value, which minimizes the penalty.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string consists entirely of `+` or `-`, the function correctly counts the number of subarrays needed.
   - If the string has a balanced number of `+` and `-`, the function correctly returns 0.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `s = "+"`, the balance never goes below 0, and the final balance is 1, so the result is `1`.
   - For `s = "-----"`, the balance goes below 0 five times, so the result is `5`.
   - For `s = "+-+-+-"`, the balance is always 0, so the result is `0`.
   - For `s = "--+++++++-"`, the balance goes below 0 twice, and the final balance is 1, so the result is `3`.
   - For `s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"`, the balance goes below 0 four times, and the final balance is 0, so the result is `4`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
