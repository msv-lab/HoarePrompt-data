### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each `+` in the string corresponds to a `1` in the array `a`, and each `-` corresponds to a `-1`.
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Analyzing the Annotated Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then splits the string `s` by the character `-` to get subarrays of `+` characters.
   - The program calls `func_1` with the string `s` and the total length of the subarrays of `+` characters.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is `+`, it increments `balance` by 1.
   - If the character is `-`, it decrements `balance` by 1.
   - If `balance` goes below 0, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count` plus 1 if the final `balance` is greater than 0.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of times the balance goes below 0, which corresponds to the number of subarrays needed to balance the negative values.
   - If the final balance is greater than 0, it means there are more `+` characters than `-` characters, and we need one additional subarray to account for the remaining positive balance.
   - The program does not explicitly split the array into subarrays but instead uses a balance mechanism to determine the optimal number of subarrays.
   - The balance mechanism ensures that each time the balance goes below 0, a new subarray is started, which is a valid approach to minimize the penalty.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For a string with only `+` characters, the balance will never go below 0, and the final balance will be positive, resulting in a penalty of 1.
   - For a string with only `-` characters, the balance will go below 0 for each character, resulting in a penalty equal to the length of the string.
   - For a string with alternating `+` and `-` characters, the balance will oscillate around 0, and the final penalty will be 0 if the string is perfectly balanced.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to minimize the penalty by counting the number of times the balance goes below 0 and adding 1 if the final balance is positive.
   - The approach is efficient and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
