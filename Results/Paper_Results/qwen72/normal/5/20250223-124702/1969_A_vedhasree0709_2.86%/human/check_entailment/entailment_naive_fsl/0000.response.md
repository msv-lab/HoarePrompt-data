Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the input where `n = 5` and `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`. According to the problem description, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 2. However, the program will output 3 in this case, which is incorrect.

The program checks for a specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`) and prints 2 if this pattern is found. Otherwise, it prints 3. This logic is too simplistic and does not account for the general structure of the problem, where friends form pairs or chains based on their best friends. The correct approach would involve identifying connected components (pairs or chains) and determining the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.
