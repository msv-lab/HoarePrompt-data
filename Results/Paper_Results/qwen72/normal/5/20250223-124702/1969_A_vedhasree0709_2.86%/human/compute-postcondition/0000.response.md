The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is being controlled by the `range` function based on the input. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be at least 1.

The state variables `t`, `n`, and `p` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, the input value that controls the loop must be considered. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is at least 1. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and `p_i â‰  i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, and the input value must be greater than 0**
