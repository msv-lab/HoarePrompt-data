The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and `p_i ≠ i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. However, based on the constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function likely processes these parameters to produce a result.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 5000; `n`, an integer between 2 and 50; and `p`, a list of distinct integers where each `p_i` is between 1 and `n` and `p_i ≠ i`. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the exact output is not specified.**
