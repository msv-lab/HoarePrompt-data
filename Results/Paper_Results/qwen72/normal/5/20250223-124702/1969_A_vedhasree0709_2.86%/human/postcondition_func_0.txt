The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads input from the user, iterating `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000. For each iteration, it reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list `l` of `n` integers. The function checks if there is any index `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such index is found, it prints `3` after the loop completes. The function does not modify the input values `t`, `n`, or `p` (where `p` is the list of integers read as `l`).
