Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify if it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

The program follows these steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case:
   - Reads the length of the array \(n\).
   - Reads the elements of the array \(a\).
   - Sorts the array \(a\).
   - Calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to the middle of the array.
   - Prints the calculated sum.

The key insight here is that to maximize the beauty of the array, we should pair the smallest and largest elements, the second smallest and second largest elements, and so on. This is because the difference between the largest and smallest elements will be the largest possible difference, and similarly for the next pairs.

Let's break down the correctness:
- **Sorting the array**: Sorting the array ensures that we can easily access the smallest and largest elements.
- **Calculating the sum**: The loop iterates from 0 to \(n // 2\), which correctly pairs the elements from the start and end of the sorted array.
- **Summing the differences**: The expression `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` correctly calculates the difference between the \(i\)-th smallest and \(i\)-th largest elements.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
