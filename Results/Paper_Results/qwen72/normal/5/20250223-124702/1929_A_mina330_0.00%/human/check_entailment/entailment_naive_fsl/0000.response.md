Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the way the beauty is calculated. According to the problem description, the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, the program calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, which is not the correct approach.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The correct output should be:
```
3
```
Because the maximum beauty can be achieved by the array \([1, 2, 3, 4]\), which gives:
\[
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
\]
However, the program will output:
```
3
```
This is coincidentally correct for this specific example, but it is not the correct approach. For a different input, such as:
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```
The correct output should be:
```
3
```
But the program will output:
```
2
```
This is because the program only considers the differences between the largest and smallest elements, rather than the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
