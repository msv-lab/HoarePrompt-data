Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by reading the input, processing each test case, and calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur. The logic used in the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input data at once and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for processing multiple test cases.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity (`a[0]`).
3. **Calculating Next Year**: For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
   \[
   \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
   \]
   This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
4. **Updating Last Year**: The `last_year` is then updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.
5. **Storing Results**: After processing all signs for a test case, the `last_year` is appended to the `results` list as a string.
6. **Writing Output**: Finally, the program writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.

The logic correctly follows the problem's requirements:
- The first sign occurs in the year `a[0]`.
- Each subsequent sign occurs in the smallest year greater than the previous year, which is a multiple of the sign's periodicity.

The provided execution summary confirms that the program reads input, processes each test case, and writes the results to standard output as expected.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
