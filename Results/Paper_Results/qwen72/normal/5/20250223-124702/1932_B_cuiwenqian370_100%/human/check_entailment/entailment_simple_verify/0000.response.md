Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly initializes `T` with the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of signs) and the list `a` (the periodicities of the signs).

2. **Calculation of the Next Year**:
   - The program initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
   - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.

3. **Sequential Occurrence**:
   - The program ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one by updating `last_year` to `next_year` after each iteration.
   - This maintains the sequential requirement as described in the problem statement.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The program appends the result for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line, as required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly. In this case, `last_year` will be `a[0]`, and the program will output `a[0]` as the result.
   - It also handles the case where all signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1`), and the result is the same as the periodicity.

6. **Performance**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once, which is efficient for the given constraints.
   - The calculation for each sign is done in constant time, making the overall time complexity O(n) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

Based on the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases and input formats as specified.

Final: **True**
