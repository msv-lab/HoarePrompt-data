### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the list.
   - The first integer `T` is read, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the number of signs) and the list `a` (the periodicities of the signs).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`, which is the year when the first sign occurs.
   - It then iterates through the list `a` starting from the second sign.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
   - The `last_year` is updated to `next_year` for the next iteration.
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the final `last_year` is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

4. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula \(\left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]\) is correct because:
     - \(\text{last\_year} + 1\) ensures that the next year is strictly after the last year.
     - \(\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1\) ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]`.
     - Dividing by `a[i]` and then multiplying by `a[i]` ensures that the result is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` greater than or equal to \(\text{last\_year} + 1\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when all periodicities are 1 (e.g., the third test case in the example).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The input parsing and the calculation of the next year for each sign are both accurate and efficient.

**Correctness: **True****
