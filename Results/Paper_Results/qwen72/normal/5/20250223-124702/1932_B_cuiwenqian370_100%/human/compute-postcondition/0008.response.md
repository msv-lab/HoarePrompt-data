The code `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` joins the elements of the list `results` with newline characters and writes the resulting string to the standard output, followed by an additional newline character. The variables `index`, `T`, and `data` remain unchanged, and the list `results` is not modified by this code.

Output State: **The variable `results` is a list of strings, each representing the last year calculated for each set of signs. The variables `index`, `T`, and `data` remain unchanged. The joined string of `results` elements, separated by newlines, followed by an additional newline, has been written to the standard output.**
