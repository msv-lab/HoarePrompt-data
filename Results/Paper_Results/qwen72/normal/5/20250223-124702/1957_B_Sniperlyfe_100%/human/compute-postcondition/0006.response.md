Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n`, where the first element `nums[0]` is 0, and the remaining elements are also 0.** 

Explanation: Since `k` is 0, the first element `nums[0]` is calculated as \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). The bit length of 0 is 1, so \(2^{1 - 1} - 1 = 2^0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\). The remaining elements in `nums` are also 0 because `k` is 0.
