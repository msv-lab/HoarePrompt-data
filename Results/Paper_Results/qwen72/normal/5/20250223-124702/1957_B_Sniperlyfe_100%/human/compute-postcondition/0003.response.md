The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. The variable `i` will be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and all other elements still initialized to 0.
- `k` is now `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - (2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1)`, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and all other elements still initialized to 0**
