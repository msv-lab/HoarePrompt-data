The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters, representing the number of coins and their initial states, respectively.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in the input list `cases`. The result for each test case is determined based on the initial states of the coins (`s`).
