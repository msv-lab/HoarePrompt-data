The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The state of `i` will be the first element of `results` when the loop starts. The variable `t` is not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted.

Given that `results` is supposed to contain `t` elements, and `t` remains unchanged, we need to ensure that `results` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`results` is a list that must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `results`**
