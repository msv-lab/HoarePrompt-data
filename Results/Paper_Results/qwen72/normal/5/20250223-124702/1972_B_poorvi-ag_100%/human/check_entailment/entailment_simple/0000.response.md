### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial state of the coins.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The program determines the winner based on the count of 'U' (facing-up) coins.
   - According to the problem, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win. If it is even, Bob will win.
   - This logic is implemented using the condition `if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:`. If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'yes' to the `results` list, indicating Alice wins. Otherwise, it appends 'no', indicating Bob wins.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case in the `results` list.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there are no facing-up coins (count of 'U' is 0), which is even, and correctly appends 'no' to the `results` list.
   - The program also handles the case where there is only one coin, which is correctly determined by the count of 'U' being odd or even.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - The problem states that both players play optimally. The logic used in the program is based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, which is a valid strategy for determining the winner in this game. This is because the game's outcome is solely determined by the initial number of facing-up coins and the parity of that number.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
