### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves a circle of coins, where each coin can be in one of two states: facing up ("U") or facing down ("D").
   - Players take turns to remove a facing-up coin and flip the adjacent coins.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because there are no facing-up coins left) loses the game.
   - The goal is to determine if Alice (the first player) will win the game if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left.
   - The state of the game is determined by the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move available, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no moves left.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice will eventually run out of moves.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the initial state of the coins `arr`.
   - It then checks if the count of 'U' characters in `arr` is odd.
   - If the count is odd, it appends 'yes' to the `results` list, indicating that Alice will win.
   - If the count is even, it appends 'no' to the `results` list, indicating that Bob will win.
   - Finally, it prints each element of the `results` list.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program correctly identifies the winning condition based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The logic of appending 'yes' or 'no' to the `results` list and then printing the results is correct.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its implementation and logic. It correctly determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins and follows the input and output specifications.

Correctness: **True**
