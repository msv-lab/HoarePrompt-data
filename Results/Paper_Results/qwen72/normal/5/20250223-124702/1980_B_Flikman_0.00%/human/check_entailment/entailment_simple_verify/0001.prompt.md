You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` which represent the number of cubes, the index of the favorite cube, and the number of cubes to be removed, respectively.
   - It then reads a list `a` of `n` integers representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Favorite Cube Value:**
   - The function correctly identifies the value of the favorite cube by accessing `a[f - 1]`.

3. **Counting Same and Greater Values:**
   - The function counts the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`).
   - It also counts the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`).

4. **Determining the Outcome:**
   - If the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube is at least `k`, the favorite cube will always be removed. This is because the favorite cube will be in one of the first `k` positions after sorting.
   - If the sum of the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube and the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will never be removed. This is because there are not enough cubes with greater or equal values to push the favorite cube into the first `k` positions.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the favorite cube may or may not be removed depending on the specific arrangement of the cubes with the same value. This is because the favorite cube could end up in any position among the cubes with the same value, and it might or might not be in the first `k` positions.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of Conditions:**
  - The condition `if greater_count >= k` correctly identifies when the favorite cube will always be removed.
  - The condition `elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k` correctly identifies when the favorite cube will never be removed.
  - The condition `else` correctly identifies when the favorite cube may or may not be removed.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `k` is equal to `n` (all cubes are removed).
  - It also handles the case where `k` is 1 (only the first cube is removed).

- **General Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where the favorite cube has a unique value.
  - It correctly handles cases where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the favorite cube will be removed, will not be removed, or may be removed based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
