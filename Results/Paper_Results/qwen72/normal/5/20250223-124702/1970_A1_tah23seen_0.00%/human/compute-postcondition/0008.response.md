To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `j`, and the list `d`.

1. **List `d`**: The loop will execute if `d` is not empty. Since `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence, it must have at least one tuple for the loop to execute.
2. **Variables `i` and `j`**: These variables are assigned values from the tuples in `d` during each iteration. Before the loop starts, `i` and `j` are not explicitly defined, but they will be assigned the first tuple in `d` when the loop begins.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ans` is an empty string.
- `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence.

To ensure the loop executes, `d` must have at least one tuple. The variables `i` and `j` will be assigned the values of the first tuple in `d` when the loop starts.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence that must have at least one tuple, `i` and `j` are assigned the values of the first tuple in `d`**
