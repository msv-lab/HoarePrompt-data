#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):

    d = {}
    d[0] = 0

            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is still an empty string, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` represents the depth of the balanced parentheses sequence at position `i - 1` in `s`, with `d[0] = 0` and `d[n] = 0`.

    #State: `ans` is a string that contains all the characters from `s` in the order of their depths, starting from the shallowest to the deepest. `s`, `n`, and `d` remain unchanged.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` that contains all the characters from `s` in the order of their depths, starting from the shallowest to the deepest.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It returns a new string `ans` that contains all the characters from `s` reordered based on their depth in the balanced parentheses sequence, starting from the shallowest to the deepest. The original string `s` remains unchanged.
