You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It returns a new string `ans` that contains all the characters from `s` reordered based on their depth in the balanced parentheses sequence, starting from the shallowest to the deepest. The original string `s` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to compute the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves computing the prefix balance for each character, sorting the characters based on the prefix balance, and then constructing the new sequence.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the input string `n` using `input()`.
     - It then calls `func_1(n)` and prints the result.

   - **Function `func_1(s)`:**
     - **Initialization:**
       - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
       - `ans` is an empty string that will store the result.
       - `d` is a dictionary initialized with `d[0] = 0` to represent the prefix balance starting from 0.

     - **Computing Prefix Balances:**
       - The program iterates through the string `s` and computes the prefix balance for each character.
       - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
       - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
       - The balance is stored in the dictionary `d` with the key as the position (1-based index).

     - **Removing the Last Element:**
       - The program removes the last element from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the balance at the end of the string is not needed for sorting.

     - **Sorting the Dictionary:**
       - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the prefix balance (`x[1]`), and in case of ties, by the position in decreasing order (`x[0]`).

     - **Constructing the Result:**
       - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from `s` based on the sorted positions.

3. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Dictionary Key Initialization:**
     - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`, but the positions in the string are 0-based. This could lead to incorrect prefix balances.
     - The correct approach would be to initialize `d` with `d[-1] = 0` and then use `d[i]` for the prefix balance.

   - **Position Handling:**
     - The program uses 1-based indexing for the positions in the dictionary, but the string `s` is 0-based. This could lead to off-by-one errors.
     - The correct approach would be to use 0-based indexing consistently.

   - **Sorting Ties:**
     - The program sorts the dictionary in increasing order of prefix balance and breaks ties in decreasing order of position.
     - However, the problem requires breaking ties in decreasing order of position, which is correctly implemented.

4. **Corrected Program:**
   - Here is the corrected version of the program to ensure it works as intended:

```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[-1] = 0  # Initialize with -1 to match 0-based indexing
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i] = d[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            d[i] = d[i - 1] - 1
    d.pop(n - 1)  # Remove the last element (0-based index)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))  # Sort by balance, then by position in decreasing order
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The original program has issues with the initialization and indexing of the dictionary `d`.
   - The corrected program ensures that the prefix balances are computed correctly and the positions are handled consistently.

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program is incorrect due to the issues with dictionary key initialization and position handling. The corrected program provided above should be used instead.
