The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, `n`, and `m`. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`. `b` is a list of `m` integers, where `1 <= m <= n`. `k` is an integer where `1 <= k <= m`. Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range `1` to `10^6`. The function returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` elements matching the frequency in `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `b` of `m` integers, and integers `k`, `n`, and `m`. It returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that contain at least `k` elements whose frequencies match the frequencies in `b`.**
