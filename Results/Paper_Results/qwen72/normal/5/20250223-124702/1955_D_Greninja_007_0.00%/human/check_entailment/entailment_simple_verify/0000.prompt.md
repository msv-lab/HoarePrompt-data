You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` that match at least `k` elements of array `b` when rearranged. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` (`b_freq`).
   - It initializes a sliding window of size `m` on array `a` and counts the frequency of elements in this window (`window_freq`).

3. **Initial Matches**:
   - It calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the window and the elements in `b` by summing the minimum of the frequencies of common elements.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program then slides the window one element at a time from the start to the end of array `a`.
   - For each slide, it updates the number of matches by:
     - Decreasing the match count if the element being removed from the window is in `b`.
     - Adjusting the frequency of the element being removed.
     - Increasing the match count if the element being added to the window is in `b`.
     - Adjusting the frequency of the element being added.
   - It checks if the current window has at least `k` matches and increments the `good_subarrays` count if it does.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to see if the last window has at least `k` matches and increments the `good_subarrays` count if it does.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, including:
- When `k` is 1.
- When `k` is equal to `m`.
- When there are repeated elements in `a` and `b`.
- When the arrays `a` and `b` have different lengths.
- When the elements in `a` and `b` are not unique.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
