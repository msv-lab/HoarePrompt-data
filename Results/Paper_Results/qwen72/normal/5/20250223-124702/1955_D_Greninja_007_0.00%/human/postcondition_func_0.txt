The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `b` of `m` integers, and integers `k`, `n`, and `m`. It returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that contain at least `k` elements whose frequencies match the frequencies in `b`. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.
