Output State: **The value of `l` will be 'NO' after the loop executes all iterations, assuming the loop completes without any interruptions. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the same as their final values after the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is provided by the user.
- For each iteration, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from the input.
- The inner loop checks each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`.
- If for any character `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, `l` is set to 'YES'.
- If the inner loop completes without finding any such character, `l` is set to 'NO'.
- The value of `l` is printed after each test case.
- After all iterations, the value of `l` will be 'NO' because the `else` block of the inner loop is executed if the loop completes without a `break` statement, and the `else` block sets `l` to 'NO'.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the same as their final values after the last iteration of the loop.
