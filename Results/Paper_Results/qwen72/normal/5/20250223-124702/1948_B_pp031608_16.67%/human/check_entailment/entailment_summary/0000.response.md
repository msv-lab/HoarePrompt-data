### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - This function is correctly implemented and does not modify the input list.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array `list1` to check if it is already sorted.
   - If it finds an element that is greater than the next element and is greater than or equal to 10, it splits that element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - This process is repeated for each element in the array.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After attempting to split elements, the program checks if the array is sorted using `func_1`.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
  - The program only splits the first element it finds that is greater than the next element and is greater than or equal to 10.
  - This approach is flawed because it may not handle all cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, but it will not split `28` into `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which is necessary to achieve a sorted array.

- **Inefficient and Incomplete:**
  - The program does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split in a single pass.
  - It also does not handle the case where the array might become sorted after multiple passes of splitting.

### Correct Approach:
- **Recursive or Iterative Splitting:**
  - The program should continue to split elements until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.
  - This can be achieved using a loop or a recursive function that keeps track of whether any changes were made in the current pass.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. It only attempts to split the first element it finds that is out of order, which is insufficient.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
