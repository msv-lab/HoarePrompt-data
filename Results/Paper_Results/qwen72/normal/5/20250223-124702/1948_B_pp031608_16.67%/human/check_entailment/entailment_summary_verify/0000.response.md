### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a significant flaw in the program. The program's logic is designed to apply the operation only once and only to the first out-of-order element it encounters. This approach is insufficient for several reasons:

1. **Multiple Operations Needed**: The problem description allows for the operation to be applied any number of times. The program only applies the operation once, which means it fails to handle cases where multiple operations are required to sort the array. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   3
   4
   12 3 55 4
   ```
   The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 55, 4]`, which is still unsorted. The program will then print `No`, but if we split `55` into `5` and `5`, and then split `4` into `4`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 4]`, which is still unsorted. The program does not handle this correctly and will print `No` prematurely.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Elements**: The program does not consider the possibility of applying the operation to multiple elements in the array. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   3
   4
   12 3 55 67
   ```
   The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 55, 67]`, which is sorted, so it will print `Yes`. However, if we split `55` into `5` and `5`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 67]`, which is still sorted. The program does not consider this and will print `Yes` without further checking, which is incorrect.

3. **Premature Termination**: The program terminates after the first operation if the array becomes sorted, without considering whether further operations might be necessary to achieve a sorted array. This can lead to incorrect results, as shown in the examples above.

### Function Summary:
- **`func_1(lst)`**: This function checks if the list `lst` is sorted in ascending order. It does not modify the input list `lst`. The function is correct and works as intended.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle the cases where multiple operations are needed to sort the array. The program's logic is too simplistic and does not account for the full range of possible scenarios.

### Final:
**False**
