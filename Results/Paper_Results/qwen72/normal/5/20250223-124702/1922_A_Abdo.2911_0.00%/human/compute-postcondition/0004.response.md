Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three inputs: an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n` and containing lowercase Latin letters). It then processes these inputs to determine if a specific condition is met: the strings `a` and `b` must match a generated template, and the string `c` must not match this template. The template is constructed by comparing characters of `a` and `b` and using uppercase characters where they differ. If the condition is met, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program is that the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last test case, and the template list will be the result of the last test case's calculations. **
