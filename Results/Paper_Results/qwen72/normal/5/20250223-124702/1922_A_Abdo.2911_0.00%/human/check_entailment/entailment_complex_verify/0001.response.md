### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template `template` by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the character to `template` as a lowercase letter.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, it appends the character from `a` to `template` as an uppercase letter.

3. **Matching Conditions:**
   - The program checks if strings `a` and `b` match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - The program checks if string `c` does not match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is not the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is different from the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output:**
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Template Construction:**
  - The logic for constructing the template is correct. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template should have the same lowercase character. If they are different, the template should have an uppercase character to ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template.

- **Matching Conditions:**
  - The conditions for checking if `a` and `b` match the template are correct.
  - The conditions for checking if `c` does not match the template are also correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are identical and `c` is different.
  - It also handles the case where `a` and `b` have different characters at some positions, and `c` has the same character as one of them at those positions.

### Issues Found:

- **Template Construction:**
  - The template construction logic is flawed. When `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the program appends `a[i].upper()` to the template. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that `b[i]` will also match the template. Instead, it should append a character that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` in lowercase form.

### Corrected Template Construction:

- When `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template should be constructed such that it is an uppercase character that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` in lowercase form. This can be achieved by selecting a character that is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

### Example of Corrected Template Construction:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                # Find a character that is different from both a[i] and b[i]
                for char in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                    if char != a[i] and char != b[i]:
                        template.append(char.upper())
                        break
        
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the template construction logic was flawed. The program as originally written does not ensure that `b` will match the template when `a` and `b` have different characters at the same position.

Final: **False**
