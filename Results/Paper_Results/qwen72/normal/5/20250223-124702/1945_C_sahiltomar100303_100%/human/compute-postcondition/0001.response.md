The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be assigned by the loop itself. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
