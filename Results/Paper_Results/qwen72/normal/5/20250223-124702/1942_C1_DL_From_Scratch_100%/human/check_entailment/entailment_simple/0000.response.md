Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal but can be managed within the function itself.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input and a list of `x` chosen vertices.
   - The chosen vertices are sorted, which is a necessary step to ensure that the vertices are processed in a clockwise order.

2. **Counting Triangles**:
   - The program initializes a `count` variable to zero.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices and counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices. Each gap of size 1 can form a triangle with the two vertices.
   - After the loop, it checks the gap between the first and last vertex in the sorted list (considering the polygon is cyclic). If this gap is 1, it increments the `count` by 1.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program prints `count + x - 2` for each test case.
   - The formula `count + x - 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces. The `count` variable accounts for the triangles formed by gaps of size 1, and `x - 2` accounts for the additional triangles that can be formed by connecting the chosen vertices.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly: `4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)`, and `y = 0`.
   - The program correctly processes the input and output for multiple test cases.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with `n = 8`, `x = 4`, and chosen vertices `[1, 6, 2, 5]`, the sorted list is `[1, 2, 5, 6]`. The gaps are `[1, 3, 1]`, and the cyclic gap is `1`. The count of gaps of size 1 is 2, and the formula gives `2 + 4 - 2 = 4`, but the correct output should be `2`. This suggests a potential issue in the logic.
   - For the second test case with `n = 8`, `x = 8`, and chosen vertices `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]`, the sorted list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. The gaps are all of size 1, and the cyclic gap is also 1. The count of gaps of size 1 is 7, and the formula gives `7 + 8 - 2 = 13`, but the correct output should be `6`. This further suggests a logic issue.
   - For the third test case with `n = 4`, `x = 2`, and chosen vertices `[1, 3]`, the sorted list is `[1, 3]`. The gap is `1`, and the cyclic gap is also `1`. The count of gaps of size 1 is 1, and the formula gives `1 + 2 - 2 = 1`, but the correct output should be `2`. This again suggests a logic issue.

6. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces should be `count + x - 2`, but the logic for counting gaps of size 1 and handling the cyclic nature of the polygon needs to be adjusted.

Given the issues identified in the example verification, the program is not correctly calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Correctness: **False**
