### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky, given the launch frequencies `a` and `b` of two installations and the visibility duration `m` of each firework.

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously using the formula:

\[ \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2 \]

However, this formula is incorrect. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the number of overlapping fireworks. The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when both installations launch fireworks at the same time. The maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation plus one additional firework for each overlapping launch.

The correct formula should be:

\[ \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m + 1}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m + 1}{b} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{m + 1}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

Where:
- \(\left\lfloor \frac{m + 1}{a} \right\rfloor\) is the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that are visible at some point.
- \(\left\lfloor \frac{m + 1}{b} \right\rfloor\) is the number of fireworks launched by the second installation that are visible at some point.
- \(\left\lfloor \frac{m + 1}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor\) is the number of overlapping launches, which should be subtracted to avoid double-counting.
- The `+1` accounts for the initial launch of both installations.

The current program does not correctly account for the overlapping launches and simply adds 2, which is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. It fails to account for the overlapping launches and uses an incorrect formula.
