You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Example

    6 7 4
    
    3 4 10
    
    7 8 56
    
    5 6 78123459896
    
    1 1 1

Output

    28645268630
    4
    2000000000000000002
    
Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    """t=int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a,b,m=map(int,input().split())
        A=int(m/a)+1
        B=int(m/b)+1
        print(A+B)"""
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        ans = m // a + m // b + 2
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, where `1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18`. It then calculates the sum of the integer division of `m` by `a`, the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2. This result is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes the printed output for each test case, and the input variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not retained in the function's scope.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem of finding the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the answer.

The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds 2 to the result. However, this approach does not account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched by the two installations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
6 7 4
```
According to the problem description, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2. This is because:
- The first installation launches fireworks at times 6, 12, 18, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks at times 7, 14, 21, ...

The only time both fireworks are visible simultaneously is after 7 minutes (from 7 to 11 minutes).

However, the program outputs:
```
3
```
This is incorrect because the program does not correctly handle the overlapping visibility periods.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the following:
1. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period.
2. Determine the overlap between the visibility periods of fireworks launched by the two installations.
3. The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is the sum of the fireworks launched by each installation minus the overlap, plus 1 (since the overlap itself counts as a single time when both are visible).

A correct implementation would look something like this:
```python
def max_fireworks_visible(t, test_cases):
    for a, b, m in test_cases:
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation
        fireworks_a = (m + a) // a
        fireworks_b = (m + b) // b
        
        # Calculate the overlap
        lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        overlap = (m + lcm) // lcm
        
        # Maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously
        max_visible = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - overlap
        print(max_visible)

from math import gcd

t = int(input())
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(t)]
max_fireworks_visible(t, test_cases)
```

This approach correctly handles the overlapping visibility periods and ensures the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is calculated accurately.
