Initial State: The function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method (e.g., standard input) and process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The coordinates \(x_i, y_i\) are within the range \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\). The number of test cases \(t\) is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 100\). It is guaranteed that the given points form a valid square with a positive area.

Now, let's analyze the code snippet step by step:

1. `n = int(input())`: The variable `n` is assigned the integer value of the input. This input represents the number of test cases.
2. `while n:`: This loop will run as long as `n` is greater than 0.
3. `l = int(input())`: Inside the loop, the variable `l` is assigned the integer value of the input. This input represents the length of the side of the square.
4. `s = 0`: The variable `s` is initialized to 0.
5. `s += (l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`: The value of `s` is updated by adding the result of the expression \((l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2\).
6. `print(s)`: The value of `s` is printed.
7. `n -= 1`: The value of `n` is decremented by 1.

After the loop completes, the program will have processed all test cases, and `n` will be 0.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `s` is the sum of the calculated values for each test case, and the calculated values for each test case have been printed. The number of test cases \(t\) is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 100\), and the coordinates \(x_i, y_i\) are within the range \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\).**
