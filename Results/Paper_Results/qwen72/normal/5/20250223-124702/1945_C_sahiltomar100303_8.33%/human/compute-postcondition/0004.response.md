Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the optimal position to split the string `s` such that the number of '0's in the left part and the number of '1's in the right part are as close as possible to half of the length of the string. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the results for each test case are printed to the console. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are used and reset for each test case, and their final values are not retained after the function completes. The internal variables used for calculations are reset for each test case and their final values depend on the last test case processed. **
