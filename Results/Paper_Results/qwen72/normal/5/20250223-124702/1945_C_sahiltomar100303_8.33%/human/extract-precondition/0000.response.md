Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each containing a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
