Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x. The loop has printed the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to k (x // n) for each iteration, where k is the integer division of x by n. If k is 1, the loop prints 1.**
