Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the logic for updating the sum `s` in the loop is incorrect. The program incorrectly calculates the expected value by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to `s` for each excursion, which does not accurately reflect the problem description.

The correct approach should involve calculating the expected value of the friendship value for each pair chosen, considering the increase in friendship value for each subsequent choice. The expected value for each pair being chosen in a single excursion is `c * m` (where `c` is the probability of choosing a pair of friends, and `m` is the number of friend pairs), and the expected increase in the friendship value for each pair chosen is `c * (a + i)` (where `a` is the initial sum of friendship values, and `i` is the current excursion number).

A correct implementation should update the expected sum `s` as follows:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i)) % M
        print(s % M)
```

This ensures that the expected value of the sum of friendship values is correctly calculated for each excursion. The original program does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for some test cases. For example, in the case where `n = 3`, `m = 1`, and `k = 2` with the initial friendship value of the single pair being 1, the program will produce an incorrect result.
