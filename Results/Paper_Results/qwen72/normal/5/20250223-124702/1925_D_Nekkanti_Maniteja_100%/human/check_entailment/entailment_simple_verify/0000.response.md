### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions accurately. Let's break down the issues and the correct approach:

1. **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
   - The variable `c` is correctly calculated as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary because the probability of choosing a pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{m}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\).

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The variable `a` is correctly calculated as the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends. This is done in the loop where the input pairs are read.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The original program updates the sum `s` in the loop using the expression `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the expected value calculation.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the expected value of the friendship value for each pair chosen in each excursion. The expected value for each pair being chosen in a single excursion is `c * m`, and the expected increase in the friendship value for each pair chosen is `c * (a + i)`, where `a` is the initial sum of friendship values, and `i` is the current excursion number.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should update the expected sum `s` as follows:
     ```python
     def func():
         for i in range(int(input())):
             (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
             M = 10 ** 9 + 7
             c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
             s = 0
             a = 0
             for i in range(m):
                 (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
                 a += f
             for i in range(k):
                 s = (s + c * (a + i)) % M
             print(s % M)
     ```
   - This ensures that the expected value of the sum of friendship values is correctly calculated for each excursion.

### Example Analysis

- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `100 0 24`
  - Since there are no pairs of friends, the initial sum of friendship values `a` is 0. The expected value for each excursion is `c * (a + i) = 0` because `a` is 0 and `c` is the modular inverse of a large number, which is effectively 0.
  - The output is `0`, which is correct.

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `2 1 10`
  - There is only one pair of friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The probability `c` of choosing this pair is 1 (since there is only one pair).
  - The expected value for each excursion is `c * (a + i) = 1 * (1 + i) = 1 + i`.
  - The sum of expected values over 10 excursions is `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55`.
  - The output is `55`, which is correct.

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `3 1 2`
  - There is one pair of friends with an initial friendship value of 1. The probability `c` of choosing this pair is \(\frac{1}{3}\) (since there are 3 children and \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\) possible pairs).
  - The expected value for each excursion is `c * (a + i) = \frac{1}{3} * (1 + i)`.
  - The sum of expected values over 2 excursions is \(\frac{1}{3} * (1 + 0) + \frac{1}{3} * (1 + 1) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = 1\).
  - The output is `777777784`, which is the correct result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - Input: `5 2 4`
  - There are two pairs of friends with initial friendship values 25 and 24. The probability `c` of choosing a pair of friends is \(\frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}\).
  - The expected value for each excursion is `c * (a + i) = \frac{1}{5} * (49 + i)`.
  - The sum of expected values over 4 excursions is \(\frac{1}{5} * (49 + 0) + \frac{1}{5} * (49 + 1) + \frac{1}{5} * (49 + 2) + \frac{1}{5} * (49 + 3) = \frac{1}{5} * (49 + 50 + 51 + 52) = \frac{202}{5} = 40.4\).
  - The output is `40000020`, which is the correct result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The correct implementation should update the expected sum `s` as shown in the corrected code.
