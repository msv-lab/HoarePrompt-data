You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
    return max_val



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (where 2 <= x <= 1000) and returns the largest integer `y` that is less than `x` and divides `x` evenly. If no such `y` exists, it returns 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case by reading an integer \( x \).
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for finding the optimal \( y \) for a given \( x \).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1, which is the smallest possible value for \( y \).
   - It then iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \), it checks if \( 2 * y \ge x \). If true, it returns \( y \) immediately.
   - If \( 2 * y < x \), it updates `max_val` to \( y \) but continues the loop.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \).
   - The expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) simplifies to \( y + y = 2y \).
   - If \( 2y \ge x \), then \( y \) is the largest possible divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \), and it maximizes \( 2y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, the function returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) and satisfies \( 2y < x \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - For \( x = 3 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - For \( x = 4 \), the possible \( y \) values are 1 and 2. \( \gcd(4, 2) + 2 = 4 \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - For \( x = 10 \), the possible \( y \) values are 1, 2, 5. \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \), which is the maximum possible value.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases and the general case.
   - The logic of finding the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) and checking if \( 2y \ge x \) ensures that the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is found.
   - The program returns the correct \( y \) for each test case based on the problem description.
