### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find such a \( y \).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` starts by initializing `max_val` to 1.
   - It then iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) but \( 2 * y < x \), it updates `max_val` to \( y \).
   - After the loop, it returns `max_val`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The function correctly identifies the largest \( y \) such that \( x \% y == 0 \) and \( 2 * y \ge x \) if such a \( y \) exists.
   - If no such \( y \) exists, it returns the largest \( y \) such that \( x \% y == 0 \).
   - If no \( y \) satisfies \( x \% y == 0 \), it returns 1, which is the smallest possible \( y \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 2 \), the function correctly returns 1, as 1 is the only valid \( y \) and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 3 \), the function returns 1, which is correct because \( \gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 2 \) and there is no \( y \) such that \( 2 \le y < 3 \).
   - For \( x = 10 \), the function returns 5, which is correct because \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \).

5. **Optimization:**
   - The function is optimized to return the first \( y \) that satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \), which ensures that the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized early in the loop.
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest \( y \) that divides \( x \), which is a valid and optimal solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly finds the integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases as described in the problem.

**Correctness: True**
