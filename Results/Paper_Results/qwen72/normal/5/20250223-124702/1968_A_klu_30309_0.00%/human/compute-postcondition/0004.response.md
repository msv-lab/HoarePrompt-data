Output State: **The program returns the largest integer `max_val` such that 2 <= `max_val` < `x` and `x` % `max_val` == 0, or 1 if no such `max_val` exists.**

In natural language: The program returns the largest integer `max_val` that is less than `x` and is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x` divided by `max_val` has no remainder). If there is no such integer, the program returns 1.
