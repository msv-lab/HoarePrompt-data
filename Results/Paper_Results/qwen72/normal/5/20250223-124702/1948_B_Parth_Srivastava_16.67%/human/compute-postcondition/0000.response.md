Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, test_cases is a list of t elements, each element is a list containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), k is an input integer.**

The value of `k` is assigned the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged.
