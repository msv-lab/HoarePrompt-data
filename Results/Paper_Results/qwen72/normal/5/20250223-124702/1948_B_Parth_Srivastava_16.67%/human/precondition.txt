The function `thing()` does not take any input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be assumed that the function is part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases, each with an integer array `a` of length `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and each element of `a` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive. The function should determine if it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the specified operation.
