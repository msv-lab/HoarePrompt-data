You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

    #State: `c` is a list containing the processed integers from `a` according to the loop logic, `n` is the length of the list `c`, `x` and `y` are the last processed digits of the last element in `a` that was greater than 10, and `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

If `c` is equal to `d`, `b` is a list with an additional element 1 appended to it. Otherwise, `b` is a list with an additional element 0 appended to it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a` from user input. It processes the list `a` by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their digits and appending them to a new list `c` based on specific conditions. The function then checks if the list `c` is sorted. If `c` is sorted, it appends 1 to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `b` to contain the result of the sorting check for the processed list `c`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails in cases where the array contains elements greater than 10 that are not in the correct position relative to their neighbors after the operation is applied.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output `NO` because it does not correctly handle the transformation of elements greater than 10 and their subsequent placement in the array.

The issue lies in the logic inside `func_1` where the program checks if the digits of a number greater than 10 can be inserted in the correct order. The program only checks if the tens digit (`y`) is greater than or equal to the previous element in the array (`c[n - 1]`), but it does not ensure that the entire array remains sorted after the operation. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the array should be transformable but the program incorrectly determines it is not.

For example, in the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should transform the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and then check if it is sorted. However, the current logic does not correctly handle this transformation and placement, leading to an incorrect output.
