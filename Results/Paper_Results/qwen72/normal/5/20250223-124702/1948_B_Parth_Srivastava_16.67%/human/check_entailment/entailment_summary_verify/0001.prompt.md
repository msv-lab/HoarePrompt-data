You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a` from user input. It processes the list `a` by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their digits and appending them to a new list `c` based on specific conditions. The function then checks if the list `c` is sorted. If `c` is sorted, it appends 1 to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `b` to contain the result of the sorting check for the processed list `c`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It iterates `m` times to process each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and processes each element:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
       - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if the digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if `c` is not empty).
       - If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
       - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
       - If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - After processing the array, it sorts the transformed array `c` and stores the result in `d`.
   - It checks if the transformed array `c` is equal to the sorted array `d`.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - Otherwise, it appends `0` to `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

4. **Output Handling:**
   - After processing all test cases, it iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' for `1` and 'NO' for `0`.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified.
- The logic for transforming the array by splitting elements greater than 10 into their digits is implemented.
- However, the logic for splitting and appending digits is not entirely correct. Specifically:
  - The program only splits elements greater than 10 if they are not the first element or if they are the first element but satisfy a specific condition (`y <= x`).
  - This means that elements greater than 10 that do not meet these conditions are not split, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`:
  - The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and `45` into `[4, 5]`.
  - The final array `c` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.
  - This array is sorted, so the program will print 'YES'.

- For the input `[12, 28, 5]`:
  - The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and `28` into `[2, 8]`.
  - The final array `c` will be `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.
  - This array is not sorted, so the program will print 'NO'.

- For the input `[0, 0]`:
  - The array is already sorted, so the program will print 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flaw in how it handles the splitting of elements greater than 10. It should split all elements greater than 10, regardless of their position or the relationship between their digits.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases where elements greater than 10 need to be split, leading to potential incorrect results.
