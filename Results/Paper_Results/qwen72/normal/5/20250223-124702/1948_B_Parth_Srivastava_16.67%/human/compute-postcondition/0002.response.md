Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements, each element is a list containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99), `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string `a` where each integer is between 0 and 99.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` converts the input string `a` into a list of integers.
- The input string `a` is split into substrings based on whitespace, and each substring is converted to an integer.
- The resulting list of integers is assigned back to the variable `a`.
- The values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `a` is a list of integers, and each integer in the list is derived from the original input string `a` and is between 0 and 99.
