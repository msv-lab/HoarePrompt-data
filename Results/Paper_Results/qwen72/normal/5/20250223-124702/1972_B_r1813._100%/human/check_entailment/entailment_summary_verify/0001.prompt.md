You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        count_u = s.count('U')
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads from standard input a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the occurrences of "U" in the string `s`. If the count is odd, it prints 'YES'; if the count is even, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the completion of all iterations, with the `index` variable equal to `2 * t + 1`, and the `t` and `data` variables remaining unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - The index is used to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.

2. **Counting 'U' Coins:**
   - For each test case, the program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd (`count_u % 2 == 1`).
   - If the count is odd, Alice wins, and the program prints 'YES'.
   - If the count is even, Bob wins, and the program prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:

- **Game Logic:**
  - The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
  - The key observation is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
  - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make the first move and leave an even number of facing-up coins for Bob. This ensures that Alice will always have a move when it's her turn, and Bob will eventually be left with no moves.
  - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he will have a move when it's his turn, and Alice will eventually be left with no moves.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where there are no facing-up coins (`count_u == 0`), which results in Bob winning.
  - The program also handles the case where there is only one coin left, which is correctly identified as a win for the player who makes the last move (Alice if the coin is facing up, Bob if it is facing down).

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads all input at once and processes it in a loop, which is efficient for the given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
