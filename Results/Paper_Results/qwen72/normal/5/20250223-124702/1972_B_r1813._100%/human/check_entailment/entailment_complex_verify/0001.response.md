### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - The index is used to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - This approach is efficient and correctly handles the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Counting 'U' Coins:**
   - For each test case, the program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - This is a straightforward and correct way to count the occurrences of 'U' in the string.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd (`count_u % 2 == 1`).
   - If the count is odd, Alice wins, and the program prints 'YES'.
   - If the count is even, Bob wins, and the program prints 'NO'.
   - The key observation that the parity of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner is correct. This is because:
     - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make the first move and leave an even number of facing-up coins for Bob. This ensures that Alice will always have a move when it's her turn, and Bob will eventually be left with no moves.
     - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he will have a move when it's his turn, and Alice will eventually be left with no moves.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no facing-up coins (`count_u == 0`), which results in Bob winning.
   - The program also handles the case where there is only one coin left, which is correctly identified as a win for the player who makes the last move (Alice if the coin is facing up, Bob if it is facing down).

5. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once and processes it in a loop, which is efficient for the given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
   - The use of `sys.stdin.read` ensures that the entire input is read in one go, which is suitable for the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
