Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. The logic in the program is attempting to find the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string and then calculate the length of the segment that needs to be painted. However, this approach fails to consider the case where there are white cells ('W') between the first and last black cells ('B') that do not need to be painted.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        # Find the first occurrence of 'B'
        first_b = s.find('B')
        # Find the last occurrence of 'B'
        last_b = s.rfind('B')
        # The minimum length to paint is the distance between the first and last 'B' + 1
        min_length = last_b - first_b + 1
        results.append(min_length)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version will correctly handle all test cases by finding the first and last 'B' and calculating the length of the segment that needs to be painted.
