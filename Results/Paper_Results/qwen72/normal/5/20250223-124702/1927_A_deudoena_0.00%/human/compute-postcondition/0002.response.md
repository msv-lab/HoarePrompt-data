Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `inpstr` is a string containing user input, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, and the function still takes a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black.**
