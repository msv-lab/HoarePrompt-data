Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in each strip is black.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. It should be updated to include the parameters as described. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing `n` and `s` as described in the precondition.
