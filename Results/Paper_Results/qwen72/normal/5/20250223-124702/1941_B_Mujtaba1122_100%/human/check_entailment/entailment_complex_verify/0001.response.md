### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - The function is correctly implemented and accurately checks the condition.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( a_i \) is greater than 1 and both \( a_{i-1} \) and \( a_{i+1} \) are greater than 0.
   - If the conditions are met, it applies the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - However, the current implementation in `func_2` is incorrect. It uses `list[i - 1]` as a multiplier, which is not the correct way to apply the operation.
   - The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
   - Additionally, the function prints "no" and returns if \( a_{i-1} \) becomes zero during the operation, which is not the correct approach. It should continue to check the entire list.
   - The final check using `func_1` is correct, but the function should return the result rather than printing it directly.

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - **Incorrect Operation Application:**
     - The operation is incorrectly applied using `list[i - 1]` as a multiplier, which can lead to incorrect decrements.
   - **Early Termination:**
     - The function prints "no" and returns if \( a_{i-1} \) becomes zero during the operation, which can prematurely terminate the function without checking the entire list.
   - **Final Check:**
     - The final check using `func_1` is correct, but the function should return the result rather than printing it directly.

5. **Corrected Function 2:**
   - The corrected function should apply the operation correctly and check the entire list after all operations are applied.
   - It should return "YES" or "NO" based on the final state of the list.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in the operation application and early termination. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
