Based on the precondition, the list has been modified through a series of operations. The key points to note are:

1. For each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-2`, the values of `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]` are decreased according to the operations inside the while loop.
2. If at any point `list[i - 1]` becomes 0, the loop prints 'no' and returns, terminating the function.
3. If the loop completes without `list[i - 1]` becoming 0 for any `i`, the list will have been modified but will not contain any 'no' print statements.
4. The function `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True`, indicating that the list and `n` satisfy the conditions checked by `func_1`.

Given that `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True`, it implies that the loop completed without printing 'no'. Therefore, the only print statement that will be executed is the one that prints 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
