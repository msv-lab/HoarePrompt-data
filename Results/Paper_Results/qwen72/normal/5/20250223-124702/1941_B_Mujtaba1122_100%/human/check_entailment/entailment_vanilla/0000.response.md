### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( a_i \) is greater than 1 and both \( a_{i-1} \) and \( a_{i+1} \) are greater than 0.
   - If the conditions are met, it applies the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - If at any point \( a_{i-1} \) becomes zero, it prints "no" and returns.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - **Incorrect Operation Application:**
     - The operation should decrement \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
     - However, the current implementation in `func_2` is incorrect. It uses `list[i - 1]` as a multiplier, which is not the correct way to apply the operation.
     - The correct operation should be:
       ```python
       list[i - 1] -= 1
       list[i] -= 2
       list[i + 1] -= 1
       ```
   - **Early Termination:**
     - The function prints "no" and returns if \( a_{i-1} \) becomes zero during the operation, which is not the correct approach. It should continue to check the entire list.
   - **Final Check:**
     - The final check using `func_1` is correct, but the function should return the result rather than printing it directly.

5. **Corrected Function 2:**
   - The corrected function should apply the operation correctly and check the entire list after all operations are applied.
   - It should return "YES" or "NO" based on the final state of the list.

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in the operation application and early termination. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] >= 2 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    if func_1(list, n):
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_2(a, n))
```

This corrected version applies the operation correctly and checks the entire list after all operations are applied.
