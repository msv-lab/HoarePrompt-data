### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `lst`.
   - It then calls `func_2(lst, n)` to process each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If the loop completes without finding any non-zero elements, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the list zero using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index `i`, it enters a `while` loop if the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are met.
   - Inside the `while` loop, it performs the operations:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - If at any point `list[i - 1]` becomes zero, it prints "no" and returns, indicating that it is not possible to make all elements zero.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Logical Flaw in `func_2`:**
   - The operations inside the `while` loop are incorrect. The loop should decrement `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation uses `list[i - 1]` as a multiplier, which can lead to incorrect results.
   - For example, if `list[i - 1]` is 2, the operations will be:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 2`
     - `list[i] -= 4`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 2`
   - This can result in negative values or incorrect decrements, which is not allowed by the problem constraints.

5. **Correct Operations:**
   - The correct operations should be:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1`
     - `list[i] -= 2`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1`
   - This ensures that the values are decremented by the correct amounts and do not become negative.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the operations inside the `while` loop in `func_2` are not implemented correctly. The current implementation can lead to negative values or incorrect decrements, which violates the problem constraints. The correct operations should decrement each element by the specified fixed amounts (1, 2, 1) without using `list[i - 1]` as a multiplier.
