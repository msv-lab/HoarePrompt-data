Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input string `n` and passes it to `func_1`. The input is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the length of the input string.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty string, which will eventually store the result.
   - `d` is a dictionary that will store the balance of the parentheses sequence at each position.

3. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`.
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
   - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - The balance is correctly computed for each prefix of the string, and the dictionary `d` is populated with the balance at each position.

4. **Dictionary Preparation**:
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` (which is the balance at the end of the string and should be 0).
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the balance in ascending order and by the negative of the position in ascending order. This ensures that the positions are sorted by balance and, in case of ties, by the position in descending order.

5. **Result Construction**:
   - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from `s` at the positions specified by the sorted dictionary `d`.
   - The characters are appended in the order determined by the sorted dictionary, which should result in the balanced shuffle of the input string.

6. **Output**:
   - The program returns the constructed string `ans`.

The program correctly follows the steps described in the problem statement to compute the balanced shuffle of the input string. The sorting and construction of the result string are done in a way that ensures the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
