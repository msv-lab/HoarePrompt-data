The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `j`, and the iterable `d`. The loop will execute if `d` is not empty. Since `d` is described as a sorted list of tuples, for the loop to execute, `d` must contain at least one tuple. Additionally, `i` and `j` will take the values of the first tuple in `d` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`d` is a sorted list of tuples containing at least one tuple, `i` is the key of the first tuple in `d`, `j` is the value of the first tuple in `d`, `ans` is an empty string**
