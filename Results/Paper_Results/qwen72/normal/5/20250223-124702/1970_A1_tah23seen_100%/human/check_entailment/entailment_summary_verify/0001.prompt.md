You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It returns a new string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` rearranged such that the parentheses are sorted by their depth in ascending order. If two characters have the same depth, they are sorted by their original position in descending order. The function ensures that the returned string `ans` maintains the balanced nature of the parentheses sequence.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the input string `n` and immediately calls `func_1(n)`. This is a valid way to handle input and process it using a function.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty string `ans` and a dictionary `d` to store the balance of each prefix.
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`, which is correct because the balance before the first character is 0.
   - The program then iterates over the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - After the loop, the dictionary `d` contains the balance of each prefix up to the last character.

3. **Removing the Last Entry**:
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary using `d.pop(n)`. This is correct because the balance of the entire string should not be included in the sorting process.

4. **Sorting the Dictionary**:
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the balance values (`x[1]`) in increasing order, and for ties, the positions (`x[0]`) are sorted in decreasing order. This is done using the `sorted` function with a custom key.
   - The result of the sorting is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the position and the balance.

5. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program then iterates over the sorted list of tuples and constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` at the positions given by the sorted list.
   - Finally, the result string `ans` is returned.

6. **Output**:
   - The result string `ans` is printed, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

**Verification**:
- Let's verify the program with the example input `(()(()))`:
  - The balance dictionary `d` will be:
    - `d[0] = 0`
    - `d[1] = 1` (for '(')
    - `d[2] = 2` (for '(')
    - `d[3] = 1` (for ')')
    - `d[4] = 2` (for '(')
    - `d[5] = 3` (for '(')
    - `d[6] = 2` (for ')')
    - `d[7] = 1` (for ')')
    - `d[8] = 0` (for ')')
  - After removing the last entry, `d` becomes:
    - `d[0] = 0`
    - `d[1] = 1`
    - `d[2] = 2`
    - `d[3] = 1`
    - `d[4] = 2`
    - `d[5] = 3`
    - `d[6] = 2`
    - `d[7] = 1`
  - Sorting the dictionary:
    - `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (7, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (4, 2), (6, 2), (5, 3)]`
  - Constructing the result string `ans`:
    - `ans += s[0]` -> `ans = '('`
    - `ans += s[1]` -> `ans = '()`
    - `ans += s[7]` -> `ans = '()('`
    - `ans += s[3]` -> `ans = '()(()'`
    - `ans += s[2]` -> `ans = '()(()('`
    - `ans += s[4]` -> `ans = '()(()('`
    - `ans += s[6]` -> `ans = '()(()())'`
    - `ans += s[5]` -> `ans = '()(()())'`
  - The final result is `()(()())`, which matches the expected output.
