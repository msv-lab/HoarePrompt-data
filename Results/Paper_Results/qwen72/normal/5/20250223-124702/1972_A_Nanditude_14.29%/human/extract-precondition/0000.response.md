It seems there's a mismatch between the problem description and the provided function definition. The problem description involves two arrays, `a` and `b`, and the function definition should reflect this. Here is the correct function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```python
def min_new_problems(a, b):
```

Precondition: **a and b are lists of integers of the same length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), where both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order, and 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 10^9 for all i.**
