Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is with the variables and the logic used to determine the minimum cost. The program reads `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, but these variables do not match the problem description. The problem states that `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. However, in the program, `a`, `b`, and `c` are used, and the logic is incorrect.

The correct logic should be:
1. Calculate the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price: `n * a`.
2. Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
3. Compare the two costs and print the minimum.

The program should read `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, and the logic should be based on these values.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price
        cost_regular = n * a
        # Cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        cost_promotion = pairs * b + remaining * a
        # Print the minimum cost
        print(min(cost_regular, cost_promotion))
```

The provided program does not follow this logic and instead uses incorrect variables and calculations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
