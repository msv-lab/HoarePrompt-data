Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `n` times, which is correct as it processes each test case individually.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. However, this is incorrect according to the problem description. The inputs should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. The program reads `a`, `b`, and `c`, which does not match the problem description.

4. **Calculations**:
   - The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which is intended to represent the price per yogurt when buying two yogurts at the promotion price. However, since `c` is not the correct input, this calculation is incorrect.
   - The program then checks if `a * b < a * d` and prints `a * b` if true, otherwise it prints `round(a * d)`. This logic is flawed because:
     - `a * b` should be the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price, but `b` is not the number of yogurts.
     - `a * d` should be the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the promotion price, but `d` is not correctly calculated.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct logic should be to compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`n * a`) with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is `(n // 2) * b`.
   - The cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price is `(n % 2) * a`.
   - The total cost should be the sum of these two costs: `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`.

6. **Output**: The program should print the minimum cost for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not correctly read the inputs and does not implement the correct logic for calculating the minimum cost.

Final: **False**
