Output State: **The loop will execute n times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers a, b, and c from the input. It will then calculate d as c / 2. If a * b is less than a * d, it will print a * b; otherwise, it will print the rounded value of a * d. The values of t and n remain unchanged, and the values of a, b, and c are read from input during each iteration and are not retained between iterations.**
