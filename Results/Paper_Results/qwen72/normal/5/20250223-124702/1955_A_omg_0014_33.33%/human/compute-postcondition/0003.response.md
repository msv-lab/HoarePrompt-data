The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates on or generates test cases involving integers `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 100`, and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return a result based on these test cases.

Since the function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information, we can infer that the function might return a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not clear. For the purpose of this description, we will assume that the function processes these test cases and returns a result that is relevant to the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within the specified constraints, and returns a result for each test case.**
