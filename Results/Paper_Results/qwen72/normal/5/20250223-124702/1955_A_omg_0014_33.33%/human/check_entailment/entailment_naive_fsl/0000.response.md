Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func()` does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program expects three integers per test case, but it incorrectly assigns them to `(a, b, c)`. According to the problem description, the input should be `(n, a, b)`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. The program should be reading `(n, a, b)` instead of `(a, b, c)`.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic inside the function is incorrect. The program calculates `d = c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This does not make sense because `c` is not defined in the problem description, and the comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price and the cost of buying them using the promotion price.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program should calculate the minimum cost by considering both the regular price and the promotion price. The correct logic should involve calculating the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price
        pairs_cost = (n // 2) * b
        # Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price
        single_cost = (n % 2) * a
        # Total minimum cost
        total_cost = pairs_cost + single_cost
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the input and calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price and the regular price.
