Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `a` from user input. The function then checks the count of '1' characters in the string `a` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions: if the count is 0, or greater than 2 and even, or exactly 2 with the two '1's not adjacent, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The variables `start` and `end` mentioned in the comments are not used in the function. **
