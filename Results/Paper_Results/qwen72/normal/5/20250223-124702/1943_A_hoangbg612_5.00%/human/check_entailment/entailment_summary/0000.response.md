Reasoning:

The program aims to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play their turns optimally. The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategies for both players and how the MEX is calculated.

1. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1 and a dictionary `M` to keep track of the counts of elements in `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is exactly `cur + 1`. If so, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks the loop, as the MEX has been found.
   - After processing the array, it checks if the sum of the counts of elements in `M` is equal to `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of any element `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.
   - Finally, it prints `cur` for each test case.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the dictionary `M` and the logic for determining the MEX.
   - The dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of elements, but the logic for updating `cur` and checking the counts is flawed.
   - The condition `if M[i] <= i` is incorrect. The MEX should be determined by the smallest integer `i` that is not in `M`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach should involve:
     - Sorting the array `N`.
     - Iterating through the sorted array to find the smallest integer `i` that is not present in `N`.
     - Since Alice and Bob play optimally, Alice will always try to include the smallest missing integer in `c` to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to exclude it to minimize the MEX.
     - The final MEX of `c` will be the smallest integer that is not present in `N` after all elements have been processed.

Given the issues in the program, the provided solution does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and does not accurately calculate the MEX.

Correctness: **False**
