Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem optimally:

1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating through the sorted array and maintaining a dictionary `M` to count occurrences of each number.
   - However, the logic for updating `cur` and checking the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if M[i] <= i` is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array, not based on the count of elements.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Optimal Play**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the optimal play for both Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. The program does not explicitly model the turns or the strategies of the players.

3. **Incorrect Final MEX Calculation**:
   - The final MEX calculation in the program is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest integer that is not in the array `c` after all elements are processed.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game considering the optimal strategies of both players. Here is a correct approach:

1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sort the array `a` to facilitate the MEX calculation.

2. **Simulate the Game**:
   - Use a counter to keep track of the elements in the array `c`.
   - Simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, with Alice always choosing the smallest element that is not yet in `c` and Bob choosing the next smallest element.

3. **Calculate MEX**:
   - After the game ends, calculate the MEX of the array `c`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    T = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        N = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + S]))
        idx += S
        
        N.sort()
        c = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(S):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                for num in N:
                    if num not in c:
                        c.add(num)
                        N.remove(num)
                        break
            else:  # Bob's turn
                N.pop(0)
        
        while mex in c:
            mex += 1
        
        results.append(mex)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read all input data at once and split it into a list for efficient processing.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - Use a set `c` to keep track of the elements chosen by Alice.
   - On Alice's turn, choose the smallest element not yet in `c` and add it to `c`.
   - On Bob's turn, simply remove the smallest element from `N`.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - After the game ends, calculate the MEX by finding the smallest non-negative integer not in `c`.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally and the MEX is calculated correctly.
