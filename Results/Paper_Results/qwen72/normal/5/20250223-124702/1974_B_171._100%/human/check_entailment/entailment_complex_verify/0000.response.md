Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is appropriate for the problem's input format, which specifies that the input consists of multiple lines.
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and the length `n` and the encoded string `b` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Unique Characters and Sorting**:
     - The program constructs the auxiliary string `r` by taking the unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorting them in alphabetical order. This is done using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
     - This step is correct because it ensures that `r` contains all distinct characters of `b` in alphabetical order.
   - **Character Mapping**:
     - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
     - The mapping is created by iterating over the sorted unique characters and assigning the symmetric character from the end of the list to the current character. This is done using `char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.
     - This step is correct because it follows the problem's requirement of replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `r`.
   - **Decoding**:
     - The program constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.
     - This is done using a generator expression inside `''.join()`, which iterates over each character in `encoded` and looks up its corresponding character in `char_map`.
     - This step is correct because it correctly applies the character mapping to each character in the encoded string.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the decoded string for each test case.
   - This is correct because it follows the problem's output format, which requires printing the decoded string for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the encoded string `b` has only one unique character. In this case, `r` will have only one character, and the mapping will be trivial (the character maps to itself).
   - The program also handles the edge case where the encoded string `b` is very long (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)) efficiently, as the operations used (set, sort, dictionary lookup, and string join) are all efficient for the given constraints.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.
   - The logic for constructing the auxiliary string `r` and the character mapping is sound.
   - The program correctly applies the character mapping to decode the string.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and reads input as specified.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly follows the decoding algorithm and handles all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
