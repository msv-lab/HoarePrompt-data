Reasoning:

The program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using the described algorithm. Let's break down the steps to ensure the program's correctness:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input data to extract the number of test cases `t` and the encoded strings `b` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an encoded string `b` as input.
   - It first creates a sorted list of unique characters in the string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in the string `b` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order.
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its mapped character from `char_map`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of decoding each test case and prints them one by one.

### Verification of the Algorithm:
- **Step 1: Constructing the Auxiliary String `r`**:
  - The auxiliary string `r` is correctly constructed by taking the unique characters from the encoded string and sorting them in alphabetical order.
  - For example, if `b = "serofedsoc"`, then `r = "cdefors"`.

- **Step 2: Creating the Character Mapping**:
  - The character mapping is created by mapping the first character in `r` to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
  - For `r = "cdefors"`, the mapping would be:
    - 'c' -> 's'
    - 'd' -> 'r'
    - 'e' -> 'o'
    - 'f' -> 'n'
    - 'o' -> 'e'
    - 's' -> 'c'

- **Step 3: Decoding the String**:
  - The program correctly decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping.
  - For `b = "serofedsoc"`, the decoded string would be:
    - 's' -> 'c'
    - 'e' -> 'o'
    - 'r' -> 'd'
    - 'o' -> 'e'
    - 'f' -> 'f'
    - 'e' -> 'o'
    - 'd' -> 'r'
    - 's' -> 'c'
    - 'o' -> 'e'
    - 'c' -> 's'
  - Thus, the decoded string is "codeforces", which is the correct original string.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Character Strings**:
  - If the encoded string is a single character, the unique characters list will have only one character, and the mapping will be a self-mapping. The program correctly handles this case.
  - For example, if `b = "w"`, the decoded string will also be "w".

- **Strings with Repeated Characters**:
  - The program correctly handles strings with repeated characters by ensuring that only unique characters are used in the mapping.
  - For example, if `b = "ttf"`, the unique characters are `['f', 't']`, and the mapping is:
    - 'f' -> 't'
    - 't' -> 'f'
  - The decoded string will be "fft", which is correct.

### Overall Correctness:
- The program correctly follows the described decoding algorithm and handles all edge cases appropriately.
- The input and output formats are also correctly adhered to.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
