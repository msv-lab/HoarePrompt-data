You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to the corresponding unique character in reverse order. The variables `encoded`, `unique_chars`, and `len_unique` remain unchanged.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, where each character in the original string `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in `char_map`. `char_map` contains a mapping of each unique character in `encoded` to the corresponding unique character in reverse order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, extracting the number of test cases `t`, the length of the encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` for each test case.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Finally, it decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the decoded strings in a list `results` and prints them one by one after processing all test cases.

### Step-by-Step Verification:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes it in a loop.
   - The index is incremented appropriately to move through the input data.

2. **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
   - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - This step ensures that the string `r` is constructed as required by the problem description.

3. **Character Mapping:**
   - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - The mapping is done correctly by iterating over the sorted unique characters and pairing them with their symmetric counterparts.

4. **Decoding:**
   - The program decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from `char_map`.
   - The decoding process is correct and follows the reverse of the encoding algorithm described in the problem.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly appends the decoded strings to the `results` list and prints them after processing all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. It handles the input and output as required, and the decoding logic is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**
