Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the decoding process based on the problem description. Here's a step-by-step verification:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded strings `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes an encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - It constructs a mapping `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric character in the list.
   - It decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of decoding each test case and prints them one by one.

The program correctly follows the steps described in the problem to decode the string, ensuring that the first character of the unique sorted list is replaced by the last, the second by the second last, and so on. This mapping is applied to the entire encoded string to produce the original string.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program works as expected and produces the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
