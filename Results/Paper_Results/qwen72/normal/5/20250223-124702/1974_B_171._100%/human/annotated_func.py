#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to the corresponding unique character in reverse order. The variables `encoded`, `unique_chars`, and `len_unique` remain unchanged.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, where each character in the original string `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in `char_map`. `char_map` contains a mapping of each unique character in `encoded` to the corresponding unique character in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string `decoded`. Each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character in reverse order according to a character mapping. The original string `encoded` remains unchanged.
