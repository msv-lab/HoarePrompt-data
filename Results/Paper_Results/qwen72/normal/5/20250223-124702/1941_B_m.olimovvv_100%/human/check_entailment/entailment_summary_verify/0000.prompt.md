You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1
    
    5
    
    0 1 3 3 1
    
    6
    
    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads `t` test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a list `b` of `a` integers. It processes the list `b` by modifying its elements according to a specific logic. If any element in `b` becomes negative during the processing or if the last two elements of `b` are not zero after the processing, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the initial state of `t`, `n`, or `a` (if they were part of the initial state).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the program attempts to reduce the elements of the array by performing the operation from the beginning of the array towards the end. However, this approach does not correctly handle all edge cases and can lead to incorrect results.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The expected output is "YES" because the operations can be applied as described in the problem statement to make all elements zero:
1. Apply the operation at \(i=4\): \([1, 3, 4, 3, 1]\)
2. Apply the operation at \(i=3\): \([1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\)
3. Apply the operation at \(i=2\): \([0, 0, 1, 2, 1]\)
4. Apply the operation at \(i=4\): \([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\)

However, the program will output "NO" because it does not correctly handle the reduction of elements in a way that ensures all elements can be made zero.

### Issue:
The program does not correctly account for the fact that the operation can be applied in a way that balances the reduction of elements across the array. The current approach only reduces elements from the beginning to the end, which can lead to incorrect results if the elements are not balanced in a way that allows all elements to be reduced to zero.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 4 and if the elements can be reduced in a way that ensures all elements become zero. This involves a more sophisticated algorithm that balances the reduction of elements across the array.
