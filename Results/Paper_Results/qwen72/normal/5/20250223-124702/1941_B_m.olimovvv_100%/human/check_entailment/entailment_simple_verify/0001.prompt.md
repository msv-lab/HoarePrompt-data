You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads an integer `a` and a list `b` of `a` integers. After processing the list `b` according to the loop logic, if any element `b[i]` is negative or if the last two elements of `b` are not zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, and the list `a` (if it was part of the initial state) is not modified by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the elements of the array `b`.

2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if any element in the array is negative before performing any operations. This is important because the operation can only subtract values, and if an element is already negative, it is impossible to make all elements zero.

3. **Operation Simulation**: The program simulates the operation by iterating through the array from the start to the second-to-last element. For each element `b[i]`, it:
   - Subtracts `b[i] * 2` from `b[i + 1]`.
   - Subtracts `b[i]` from `b[i + 2]`.
   - Sets `b[i]` to zero (by subtracting `b[i]` from itself).

4. **Final Check**: After simulating the operations, the program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has exactly 3 elements.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has more than 3 elements.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm ensures that each element `b[i]` is reduced to zero by transferring its value to the next two elements.
   - The final check ensures that the last two elements are zero, which is necessary for the entire array to be zero.

However, there is a critical flaw in the program:
- **Negative Values**: The program does not correctly handle the case where the operation might result in negative values in the array. Specifically, the line `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` can potentially make `b[i + 1]` or `b[i + 2]` negative, which would make it impossible to achieve the goal of making all elements zero.

To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` do not become negative during the operation.

Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            if b[i + 1] < b[i] * 2 or b[i + 2] < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] = 0
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
```

**Correctness: False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the operation might result in negative values in the array, which would make it impossible to achieve the goal of making all elements zero. The corrected program addresses this issue by adding additional checks to prevent negative values.
