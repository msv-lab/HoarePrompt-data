### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires rearranging a permutation so that a binary search can find a given number \( x \) correctly.
   - The binary search algorithm is described, and it is mentioned that we can perform up to 2 swaps to achieve the correct arrangement.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, the element at position \( l \) is equal to \( x \).

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we need to read the length of the permutation \( n \) and the number \( x \) to be found.
   - We also need to read the permutation itself.

3. **Binary Search Requirement**:
   - Binary search requires the array to be sorted.
   - Since the permutation is not necessarily sorted, we need to perform swaps to make it possible for the binary search to find \( x \).

4. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient to rearrange the permutation so that the binary search can find \( x \).
   - We need to identify the positions of \( x \) and the elements that need to be swapped to ensure the binary search works correctly.

5. **Output Format**:
   - For each test case, we need to output the number of swaps \( k \) (0 to 2).
   - If \( k \) is greater than 0, we need to output the indices of the elements to be swapped.

6. **Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code consists of several functions for reading input.
   - However, the code does not implement the logic for rearranging the permutation or performing the binary search.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are placeholders for reading different types of input, but they do not solve the problem.
   - The function `func_5` returns a list of strings, which is not directly useful for the problem since we need to work with integers.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. It only contains functions for reading input, which is not sufficient to rearrange the permutation or perform the binary search as described in the problem statement. The functions provided are not even used in the context of the problem, and the main logic for solving the problem is missing.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
