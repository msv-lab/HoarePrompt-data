The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state before the loop starts should ensure that this condition is met.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
