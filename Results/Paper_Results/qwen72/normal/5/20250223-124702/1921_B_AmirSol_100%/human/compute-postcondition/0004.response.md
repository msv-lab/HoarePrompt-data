Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `s1` (a string of '0' and '1' characters), and `s2` (a string of '0' and '1' characters), all of length `n`. It returns the maximum number of operations required to either add or remove cats to transform the initial positions (`s1`) into the desired positions (`s2`). Specifically, it calculates the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1' (indicating cats that need to be added) and the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' (indicating cats that need to be removed). The function then returns the larger of these two counts. **
