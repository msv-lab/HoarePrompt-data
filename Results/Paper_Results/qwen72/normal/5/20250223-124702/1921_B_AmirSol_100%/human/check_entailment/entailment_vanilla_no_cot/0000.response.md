Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (where some boxes may have cats and others may not) to the desired state. The operations are:

1. Adding a cat to a box that currently has no cat.
2. Removing a cat from a box that currently has a cat.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The function `func_1` computes the number of cats that need to be added and the number of cats that need to be removed. The minimum number of days required to achieve the desired state is the maximum of these two values, as you can only perform one operation per day. This approach is efficient and works within the constraints provided. The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case as expected.
