#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing the initial and desired positions of cats in the boxes, respectively.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0')
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    #The program returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, where `cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1', and `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `s1` (a string of '0' and '1' characters), and `s2` (a string of '0' and '1' characters), all of length `n`. It returns the maximum number of operations required to either add or remove cats to transform the initial positions (`s1`) into the desired positions (`s2`). Specifically, it calculates the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1' (indicating cats that need to be added) and the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' (indicating cats that need to be removed). The function then returns the larger of these two counts.
