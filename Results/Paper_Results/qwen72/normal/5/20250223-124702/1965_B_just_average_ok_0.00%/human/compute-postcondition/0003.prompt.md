You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but based on the problem description, it is expected to handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The function should be able to process up to 1000 test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: The function processes each test case by modifying a list `nums` and printing the length of `nums` followed by the elements in `nums`. After all iterations of the loop, the variables `n`, `k`, and `nums` will have been used and modified for each test case, but the final state of these variables will be the state after the last test case has been processed. The list `nums` will contain four elements: the original powers of 2 up to 2^23, plus the three new elements added in the last test case, and minus the element that was removed. The length of `nums` will be 26 for the last test case. The specific values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` will depend on the input for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases internally, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and returns a result for each test case. The function can handle up to 1000 test cases, with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 10^7.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
