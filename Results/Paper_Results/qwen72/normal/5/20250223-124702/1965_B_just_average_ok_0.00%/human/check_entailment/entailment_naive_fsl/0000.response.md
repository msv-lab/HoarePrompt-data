Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the sequence `nums` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) have a subsequence that sums to them is flawed. Here is an example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
8 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```

**Actual Output:**
```
24
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194304 8
```

The program appends `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1` to the sequence, and then appends `k + nums[idx] + 1`. However, this does not guarantee that no subsequence will sum to `k` and that all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) will have a subsequence that sums to them. In the example above, the sequence generated is much larger than 25 and does not meet the problem's constraints.
