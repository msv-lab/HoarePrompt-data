The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but based on the problem description, it is expected to handle multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The function should be able to process up to 1000 test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
