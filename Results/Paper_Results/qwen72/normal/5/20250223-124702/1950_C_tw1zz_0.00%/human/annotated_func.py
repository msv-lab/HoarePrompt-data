#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59). The input `s` is always a valid time in 24-hour format. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440).

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the loop will read a time in the format "hh:mm" and convert the hour to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The output state after all iterations will be a series of converted times, each on a new line, in the format "hh:mm AM/PM". The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will be updated for each iteration based on the input time, but their final values will be the ones from the last iteration. The initial state of `t` and the input times will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" (where `hh` is the hour from 00 to 23 and `mm` is the minute from 00 to 59). It converts the hour to a 12-hour format and appends the appropriate AM/PM notation. The function prints the converted time for each test case in the format "hh:mm AM/PM". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the output of all converted times, each on a new line. The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` are updated for each iteration, but their final values will be the ones from the last iteration. The initial state of `t` and the input times remain unchanged.
