Reasoning:  
The program provided is intended to convert a given time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, and it does so by checking the hour part of the input time and converting it accordingly. However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Redundant Conditions**: The conditions for hours 01 to 12 are redundant because they all set `h1` to the same value as `h` and `time` to 'AM'. This can be simplified.
2. **Incorrect Handling of '12'**: The program incorrectly sets the time to 'AM' for the hour '12'. According to the 12-hour clock, '12' should be 'PM' if the hour is 12 in the 24-hour format.
3. **Incorrect Handling of '00'**: The program sets the time to 'PM' for the hour '00'. According to the 12-hour clock, '00' should be '12:00 AM'.

A correct approach would be to:
- Convert hours 01 to 11 to the same value and set `time` to 'AM'.
- Convert hour 12 to '12' and set `time` to 'PM'.
- Convert hours 13 to 23 to the hour minus 12 and set `time` to 'PM'.
- Convert hour 00 to '12' and set `time` to 'AM'.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
