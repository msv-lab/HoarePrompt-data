You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the loop will read a time in the format "hh:mm" and convert the hour to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The output state after all iterations will be a series of converted times, each on a new line, in the format "hh:mm AM/PM". The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will be updated for each iteration based on the input time, but their final values will be the ones from the last iteration. The initial state of `t` and the input times will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` of the format `hh:mm` and splits it into `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).

2. **Time Conversion:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hours to 12-hour format hours and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, the program correctly sets the hour to the same value and appends `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, the program correctly sets the hour to `12` and appends `AM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, the program correctly sets the hour to the corresponding 12-hour format hour and appends `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, the program correctly sets the hour to `12` and appends `PM`.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program constructs the output string in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` and prints it using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - `00:00` is converted to `12:00 AM`.
     - `12:00` is converted to `12:00 PM`.
     - `00:59` is converted to `12:59 AM`.
     - `23:59` is converted to `11:59 PM`.

5. **General Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles all other general cases within the 24-hour format.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly converts the 24-hour format time to the 12-hour format time and handles all edge cases and general cases as expected.

Correctness: **True**
