Reasoning:

The program aims to convert a given time in 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It then uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour part of the time to the 12-hour format and determine whether it should be "AM" or "PM".

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Redundant Code**: The `if-elif` statements for hours 01 to 12 are redundant because they all set `h1` to the same value as `h` and `time` to "AM". This can be simplified to a single condition.
2. **Incorrect Conversion for "12:00 PM"**: The program incorrectly converts "12:00" to "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM". The condition for `h == '12'` should set `time` to "PM".
3. **Incorrect Conversion for "00:00"**: The program correctly converts "00:00" to "12:00 AM", but the condition for `h == '00'` should set `time` to "AM" instead of "PM".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == '00':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '12':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'PM'
        elif int(h) < 12:
            h1 = h
            time = 'AM'
        else:
            h1 = str(int(h) - 12).zfill(2)
            time = 'PM'
        
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Hour Conversion**:
  - If `h` is '00', it is converted to '12' and set to "AM".
  - If `h` is '12', it is kept as '12' and set to "PM".
  - If `h` is less than '12', it is kept as is and set to "AM".
  - If `h` is greater than or equal to '12', it is converted to `h - 12` and set to "PM". The `zfill(2)` function ensures that the hour is always two digits (e.g., '01' instead of '1').

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
