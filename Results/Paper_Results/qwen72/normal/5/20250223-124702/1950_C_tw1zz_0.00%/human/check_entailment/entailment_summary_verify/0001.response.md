### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` of the format `hh:mm` and splits it into `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).

2. **Time Conversion:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hours to 12-hour format hours and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, the program correctly sets the hour to the same value and appends `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, the program correctly sets the hour to `12` and appends `AM`. However, this is incorrect. According to the 12-hour clock, `12:00` should be `12:00 PM`, not `12:00 AM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, the program correctly sets the hour to the corresponding 12-hour format hour and appends `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, the program correctly sets the hour to `12` and appends `PM`.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program constructs the output string in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` and prints it using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles most edge cases correctly:
     - `00:00` is converted to `12:00 AM`.
     - `00:59` is converted to `12:59 AM`.
     - `23:59` is converted to `11:59 PM`.
   - However, it fails to handle the edge case `12:00` correctly, converting it to `12:00 AM` instead of `12:00 PM`.

5. **General Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles all other general cases within the 24-hour format.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has a critical flaw in handling the edge case where the hour is `12`. This specific case should be `12:00 PM`, but the program incorrectly outputs `12:00 AM`. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False**
