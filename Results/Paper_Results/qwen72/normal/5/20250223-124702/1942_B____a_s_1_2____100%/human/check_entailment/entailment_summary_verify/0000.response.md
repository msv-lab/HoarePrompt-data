Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - The permutation `p` is initialized with `-1` for all positions, which is a neutral value indicating that the elements have not been set yet.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible value for the MEX of the permutation at the start. This is because initially, all integers from 0 to `n-1` are missing, so the MEX is `n`.

3. **Calculating `p[i]`**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, it prints the elements of `p`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of a prefix `p[1:i+1]` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the prefix.
  - By iterating in reverse, the program ensures that the MEX is updated correctly for each position. This is because the MEX of the prefix `p[1:i+1]` is influenced by the values already set in `p[i+1:n]`.

- **Consistency with `a`**:
  - The value `a[i]` is given by the formula `a[i] = MEX(p[1:i]) - p[i]`.
  - Rearranging this formula, we get `p[i] = MEX(p[1:i]) - a[i]`.
  - The program uses `mex` to represent the current MEX of the prefix `p[1:i+1]` and updates `p[i]` accordingly.
  - The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that the MEX is correctly adjusted for the next iteration.

- **Valid Permutation**:
  - Since `mex` is always a non-negative integer and is updated to the minimum value, `p[i]` will always be a valid permutation element (i.e., a non-negative integer less than `n`).
  - The program ensures that all elements from 0 to `n-1` are used exactly once, which is a requirement for a valid permutation.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example provided:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `5`, `1 1 -2 1 2`
- Expected Output: `0 1 4 2 3`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 5`
   - `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`
   - `mex = 5`

2. **Iteration**:
   - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
   - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
   - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
   - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
   - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`

3. **Output**:
   - `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `0 1 2 3 4`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 5`
   - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`
   - `mex = 5`

2. **Iteration**:
   - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
   - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
   - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
   - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
   - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`

3. **Output**:
   - `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `3`, `-2 1 2`
- Expected Output: `2 0 1`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = 3`
   - `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
   - `p = [-1, -1, -1]`
   - `mex = 3`

2. **Iteration**:
   - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
   - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`

3. **Output**:
   - `p = [2, 0, 1]`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` for each test case. The logic ensures that the MEX calculation and the construction of `p` are consistent with the problem requirements. Since the problem guarantees at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data, and the program constructs such a permutation, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**
