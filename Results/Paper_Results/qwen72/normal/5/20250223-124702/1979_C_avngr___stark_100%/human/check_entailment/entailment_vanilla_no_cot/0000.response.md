Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which is not relevant to the problem of distributing the coins such that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

To solve the problem, you need to find a distribution of coins \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total bet \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome \( k_i \cdot x_i \). This can be achieved by setting \( x_i \) to a value that ensures the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome. A simple approach is to set \( x_i \) to \( 1 \) for all \( i \), and then check if the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome. If this condition is not met, you can adjust the bets accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def solve(test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, multipliers = case
        total_bet = sum(1 for _ in range(n))
        if total_bet < min(multipliers):
            results.append([1] * n)
        else:
            results.append([-1])
    return results

# Reading input
t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    multipliers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, multipliers))

# Solving each test case
results = solve(test_cases)

# Outputting results
for result in results:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This program checks if the minimum multiplier is greater than the number of outcomes, which is a simple and effective way to determine if a valid distribution of coins exists. If it does, it outputs a distribution where each outcome is bet 1 coin. If not, it outputs `-1`.
