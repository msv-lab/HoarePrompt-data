You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n people in the programming contest chat. Chat participants are
ordered by activity, but each person sees himself at the top of the list.

For example, there are 4 participants in the chat, and their order is [2, 3,
1, 4] . Then

  * 1 -st user sees the order [1, 2, 3, 4] . 
  * 2 -nd user sees the order [2, 3, 1, 4] . 
  * 3 -rd user sees the order [3, 2, 1, 4] . 
  * 4 -th user sees the order [4, 2, 3, 1] . 

k people posted screenshots in the chat, which show the order of participants
shown to this user. The screenshots were taken within a short period of time,
and the order of participants has not changed.

Your task is to determine whether there is a certain order that all
screenshots correspond to.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains two integers n
and k (1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, n \cdot k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted
screenshots.

The following k lines contain descriptions of screenshots posted by the
participants.

The i -th row contains n integers a_{ij} each (1 \le a_{ij} \le n , all a_{ij}
are different) — the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0} ,
where a_{i0} — the author of the screenshot. You can show that in the
screenshot description it will always be at the top of the list.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot k for all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . It is also guaranteed that all the authors of the screenshots
are different.

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
an answer, output "YES" if there exists at least one order of participants,
under which all k screenshots could have been obtained. Otherwise, output
"NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves two integers `n` and `k`, and `k` lines of input, each containing `n` distinct integers. The function checks if the order of participants in the chat can be consistently reconstructed from the given inputs. For each test case, it outputs 'yes' if the conditions are met, and 'no' otherwise. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, or the input lists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails in cases where the order of participants in the screenshots does not allow a consistent order to be determined. Here is a test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 3
1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
3 2 1 4
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
```

In this case, the first screenshot shows the order `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the second shows `[2, 3, 1, 4]`, and the third shows `[3, 2, 1, 4]`. There is no consistent order of participants that can satisfy all three screenshots. The program incorrectly outputs "YES" for this case.
