Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is a list of integers of length 2 (i.e., `n = 2`), where each element `a_i` in `c` satisfies `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`.
- `m` is 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(f'1 2')
```

This `print` statement is a formatted string that does not reference any variables or objects from the initial state. It simply prints the literal string `'1 2'`.

Output: **1 2**
