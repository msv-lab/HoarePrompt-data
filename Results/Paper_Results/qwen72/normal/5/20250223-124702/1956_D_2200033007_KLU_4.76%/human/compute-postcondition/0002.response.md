The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs a fixed string. The initial state describes the list `c` and the variable `m`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Given the initial state:
- `c` is a list of integers of length 2, where each element \(a_i\) in `c` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `m` is 0.

The `print` statement is:
```
print(f'4 1')
```

This statement will print the string `'4 1'` regardless of the values of `c` or `m`.

Output: **4 1**
