Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The program provided has several critical issues that prevent it from solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input and Data Types**:
   - The input values are read as strings and appended to the list `a` without converting them to integers. This will cause issues when performing operations on the list elements, as the program expects integers but gets strings. The correct approach would be to convert each string to an integer before appending it to the list `a`.

2. **Limited Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` only handles the case where the length of the array is 2 and prints a fixed output. It does not handle other lengths of the array, such as 3, 4, or 1, as shown in the examples provided in the problem description. For lengths other than 2, it prints a fixed output of `13 0`, which is incorrect for most cases. The function should be able to handle any length of the array from 1 to 18 and compute the maximum sum accordingly.

3. **Missing Logic**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to compute the MEX of a subarray and update the subarray elements accordingly. The MEX operation is a crucial part of the problem, and the program should calculate the MEX for different subarrays and update the array elements based on this value.
   - It does not calculate the maximum sum of the array elements after performing the operations. The program should keep track of the sum of the array and ensure that it is maximized.
   - It does not construct and output the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum. The program should output the operations it performs to reach the maximum sum, as required by the problem statement.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
13 0
```
which is incorrect. The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect and does not solve the problem as specified.

Final: **False**
