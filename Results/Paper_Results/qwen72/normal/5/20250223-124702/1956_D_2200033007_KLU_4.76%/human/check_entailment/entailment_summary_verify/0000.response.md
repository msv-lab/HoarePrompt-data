Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues and validate the assessment step-by-step:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input and Data Types**:
   - The input values are read as strings and appended to the list `a` without converting them to integers. This is evident from the code snippet:
     ```python
     sa = input()
     na = sa.split()
     for ai in na:
         a.append(ai)
     ```
     Here, `ai` is a string, and appending it to `a` results in a list of strings, not integers. This will cause issues when performing operations on the list elements, as the operations require integer values.

2. **Limited Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` only handles the case where the length of the array is 2 and prints a fixed output of "4 1" and "1 2". This is correct for the specific case where the array length is 2 and the elements are [0, 1], but it does not handle other lengths of the array.
   - For lengths other than 2, it prints a fixed output of "13 0", which is incorrect for most cases. This is evident from the function definition:
     ```python
     def func_1(c):
         m = 0
         if c == 2:
             print(f'4 1')
             print(f'1 2')
         else:
             print(f'13 0')
         return
     ```
     The function does not consider the actual values in the array or the MEX operation, which is crucial for solving the problem.

3. **Missing Logic**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to compute the MEX of a subarray and update the subarray elements accordingly.
   - It does not calculate the maximum sum of the array elements after performing the operations.
   - It does not construct and output the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
13 0
```
which is incorrect. The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
This is because the MEX of the subarray [1, 100, 2, 1] can be computed and used to update the subarray elements to maximize the sum.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
