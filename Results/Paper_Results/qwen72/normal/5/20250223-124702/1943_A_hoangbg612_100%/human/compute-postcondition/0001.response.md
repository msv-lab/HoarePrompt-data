The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `T`. The loop's execution depends on the value of `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is commonly used to indicate that the loop index is not used within the loop body. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `T` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
