Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 1 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output `3`.

**Reason:**
The program incorrectly calculates the MEX value. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where the array contains multiple occurrences of the same number. Specifically, the program does not ensure that Alice and Bob are playing optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively. The program simply sorts the array and tries to find the smallest missing number, but it does not simulate the game correctly.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should simulate the game by considering the optimal moves for both Alice and Bob. Alice will always try to pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and that can increase the MEX, while Bob will try to pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` but will not increase the MEX. This requires a more sophisticated approach to track the state of the game and the MEX value at each step.
