### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_2` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which is used to read the values of `n`, `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `arr` to store pairs of item prices for Alice and Bob.
   - It reads `n` and `k` using `func_2`.
   - It reads the prices for Alice and Bob, converting Alice's prices to negative values to use a min-heap as a max-heap.
   - It sorts the `arr` list based on Bob's prices in ascending order.
   - It uses a min-heap `k_arr` to keep track of the `k` items with the highest Bob's prices that Alice can sell to Bob.
   - It calculates the initial profit `sub_sum` by summing the negative Alice's prices in `k_arr` and the combined profit of the remaining items in `arr`.
   - It iterates over the remaining items in `arr`, adjusting the profit by removing the least profitable item from `k_arr` and adding the current item's profit.
   - It updates the maximum profit `max_value` if the current profit `sub_sum` is greater.

3. **Optimality**:
   - The sorting step ensures that Bob will always choose the `k` items with the highest Bob's prices to take for free.
   - The heap operations ensure that Alice can dynamically adjust her selection to maximize her profit, considering the items Bob will take for free.
   - The profit calculation is done by summing the negative Alice's prices (which represent the cost to Alice) and the combined profit of the remaining items.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0, meaning Bob takes no items for free.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n`, meaning Bob takes all items for free.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum profit `max_value`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit based on the given problem description. It handles all edge cases and uses efficient data structures (heaps) to ensure optimal performance. The algorithm ensures that both Alice and Bob act optimally, with Alice maximizing her profit and Bob minimizing it by taking the `k` most expensive items for free.

### Correctness:
**True**
