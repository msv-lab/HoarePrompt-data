Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `putin()` to read input, which is not a standard Python function. Typically, `input()` is used to read input in Python. This is a critical issue as the program will not run as expected with the current input handling.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads a single integer from the input. It is used to read the number of test cases `t`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers. It is used to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, as well as the arrays `a` and `b`.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is supposed to calculate Alice's profit. However, the logic in this function is flawed:
   - It initializes `sub_summ` to 0.
   - It iterates over `sec_arr` and adds the first element of each tuple to `sub_summ`. This is incorrect because `sec_arr` is not defined in the function, and it should be the array `a` or `b` depending on the context.
   - It then iterates over `main_ar` and adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ` if the sum is non-negative. This is also incorrect because `main_ar` is not defined in the function, and the logic does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

5. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should choose items that maximize her profit, which is `b_i - a_i`.
   - Bob will take the `k` items with the smallest `b_i - a_i` values to minimize Alice's profit.
   - The correct approach would be to calculate the profit for each item (`b_i - a_i`), sort these profits in descending order, and then sum the first `n - k` items (since Bob will take the `k` items with the smallest profit).

6. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n` and `k`.
   - Read the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - Calculate the profit for each item (`b_i - a_i`).
   - Sort the profits in descending order.
   - Sum the first `n - k` items to get Alice's profit.

Given the issues in the input handling and the logic in `func_3`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
