### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_2` is used to read the input for `n` and `k`, and the prices `a` and `b` for each item. This function is called multiple times to read different parts of the input.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - The prices for Alice (`a`) are negated to facilitate the use of a min-heap (since Python's `heapq` is a min-heap by default).
   - The items are stored in a list `arr` as tuples `[a[i], b[i]]`.

3. **Initial Setup**:
   - The items are sorted by Bob's price in ascending order.
   - The first `k` items (with the lowest Bob's prices) are pushed into a min-heap `k_arr` and removed from `arr`.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - `func_3` is called to calculate the initial profit `sub_sum` by summing the negated Alice's prices in `k_arr` and adding the sum of `a[i] + b[i]` for items in `arr` where `a[i] + b[i] >= 0`.
   - The main loop iterates over the remaining items in `arr`:
     - It subtracts Bob's price for the current item from `sub_sum`.
     - If the sum of Alice's and Bob's prices for the current item is non-negative, it adds this sum to `sub_sum`.
     - It uses `heapq.heappushpop` to replace the smallest item in `k_arr` with the current item, ensuring that `k_arr` always contains the `k` items with the highest Bob's prices.
     - It updates `max_value` if the new `sub_sum` is greater than the current `max_value`.

5. **Output**:
   - The maximum profit `max_value` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Optimality**:
  - Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it.
  - By sorting the items by Bob's price and using a min-heap, the algorithm ensures that Bob will take the `k` items with the lowest Bob's prices, which minimizes Alice's loss.
  - The algorithm then iteratively considers the remaining items to maximize Alice's profit by adding the items that contribute positively to the profit and replacing the least profitable items in the heap.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The algorithm handles the case where `k = 0` correctly by not pushing any items into the heap initially.
  - It also handles the case where `k = n` by ensuring that all items are considered for profit calculation.

- **Correctness**:
  - The algorithm correctly calculates the profit for each test case by considering all possible subsets of items and ensuring that Bob's actions are optimal.
  - The use of a min-heap and sorting ensures that the algorithm efficiently finds the optimal solution.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly designed to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and ensures that both Alice and Bob act optimally.

**Correctness: True**
