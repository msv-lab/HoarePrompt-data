The function `func_2` reads a string input from the `putin()` function, splits the string into parts based on whitespace, converts each part into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not modify any external variables and does not have any side effects. After the function call, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
