Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the movement of the pinball for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when the grid contains a mix of '<' and '>' characters in certain configurations.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the input:
```
1
5
><><>
```

Expected output:
```
2 4 6 4 2
```

Actual output from the program:
```
1 4 7 4 1
```

The program incorrectly calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid from the second and third cells. For the second cell, the pinball should take 4 seconds to leave the grid, but the program outputs 4. For the third cell, the pinball should take 6 seconds to leave the grid, but the program outputs 7. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not correctly handle the inversion of the characters and the subsequent movements of the pinball.
