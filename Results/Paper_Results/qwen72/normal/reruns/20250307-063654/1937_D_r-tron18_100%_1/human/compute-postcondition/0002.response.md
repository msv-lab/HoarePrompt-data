Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0.**

Explanation:
- `preOne` is created using the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module, which computes the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting with an initial value of 0.
- The first element of `preOne` is 0.
- Each subsequent element in `preOne` is the sum of the previous element in `preOne` and the corresponding element in `pre`.
- The length of `preOne` is `len(pre) + 1`.
- All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`) remain unchanged.
