Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the character at the last position of `s1` and `el` is equal to '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is called with `suffZero` being a list containing a single element 0, and `ol` being equal to `totalOne`.
- Since `ol` is less than or equal to `zr` (which is 0), the function `func_1` likely returns 0 (assuming `func_1` returns the first index where the condition is met, and since `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, it meets the condition at index 0).
- `zeroInd` is then assigned the value `2 * 0`, which is 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
