Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, but the last element has been removed, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if `el` is '>', or a list containing two elements: 0 and `n` if `el` is '<', `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne` minus 1, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `ans[i]` is calculated based on the updated values of `ol` and `zr`.**

Explanation:
- `totalOne` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `totalOne - 1`.
- All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `zr`) remain unchanged.
- `ol` is updated to `totalOne - 1` because `totalOne` has been decremented.
- The calculation of `ans[i]` depends on the updated values of `ol` and `zr`, but the specific value of `ans[i]` is not recalculated here. The logic for `ans[i]` remains the same, but it will use the new value of `ol` in its computation.
