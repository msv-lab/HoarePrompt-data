Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list with an additional element appended, which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1, `zeroInd` is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]` assigns the value `2 * preOne[-1]` to the variable `oneInd`.
- `preOne[-1]` is the last element of the list `preOne`, which is the cumulative sum of all elements in `pre`.
- Therefore, `oneInd` is equal to `2 * preOne[-1]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
