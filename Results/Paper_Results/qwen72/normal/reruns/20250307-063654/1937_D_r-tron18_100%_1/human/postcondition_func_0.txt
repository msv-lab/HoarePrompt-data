The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times`. It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. The index `max(-n, -1 - times)` will always point to a valid element in the list, either the last element or an element before it, depending on the value of `times`. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.
