Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0. `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`. `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except the last element which is `n - (2 * preOne[-1])`. `i` is `n - 1`. The character at the last position of `s1` is '<'. `ol` is `totalOne`. `zr` is 1. `zr` is greater than `ol`. `zeroInd` is `n`. `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
