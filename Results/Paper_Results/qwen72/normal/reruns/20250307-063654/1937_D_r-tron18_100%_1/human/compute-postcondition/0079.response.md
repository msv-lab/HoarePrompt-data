Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', or remains unchanged if `el` is '<'. `suffZero` is a list where the last element is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` and the length of `suffZero` is increased by 1. `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. `i` is `n - 3`, and `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne`. `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`. `oneInd` is 2 times the last element of `preOne`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]` assigns the value `2 * preOne[-1]` to `oneInd`.
- `preOne` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it is assumed to be a list related to `pre` (which contains the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`).
- The other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`) remain unchanged.
