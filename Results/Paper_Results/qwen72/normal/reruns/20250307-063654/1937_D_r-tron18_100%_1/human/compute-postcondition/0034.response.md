Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if `el` is '>', or a list containing two elements: 0 and `n` if `el` is '<', `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is decreased by 1, the last element of `preOne` is removed, and if `ol` (which is equal to `totalOne`) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is 0), `ans[n-1]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd` (where `zeroInd` is 0 and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`), otherwise `ans[n-1]` is set to `n + 1 - fi` (where `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`), and `i` is updated to `n - 2`. If `el` is '<', the character at the last position of `s1` is '<', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `n`, and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]` if `zr` > `ol` or `2 * func_1(preOne, 1)` if `zr` <= `ol`. If `zr` <= `ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `n + 1 + zeroInd - oneInd`, and if `zr` > `ol`, the last element of `ans` is set to `n - (2 * preOne[-1])`. In both cases, `i` is `n - 1`.**
