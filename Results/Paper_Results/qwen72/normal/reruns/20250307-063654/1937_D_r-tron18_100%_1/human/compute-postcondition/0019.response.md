Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If `ol` (which is equal to `totalOne`) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is 0), `ans[i]` (where `i` is `n - 1`) is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`, with `zeroInd` being 0 and `oneInd` being `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is set to `n + 1 - fi`, where `fi` is equal to `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`, and `i` is updated to `n - 2`.***
