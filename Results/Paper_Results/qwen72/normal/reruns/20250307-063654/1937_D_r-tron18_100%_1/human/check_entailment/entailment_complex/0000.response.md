### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell moves left or right based on the character in that cell and inverts the character after moving.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either end.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each for a pinball placed on the i-th cell, and output the number of seconds it takes to leave the grid.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, times)`**:
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
     - It is used to compute intermediate values needed for the main logic in `func_2`.

   - **`func_2(s1, n)`**:
     - This function processes the string `s1` to calculate the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
     - **Initialization**:
       - `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
       - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`.
       - `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of the indices in `pre`, starting with 0.
       - `suffZero` is a list that will store cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters encountered from the right.
       - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0, which will store the results for each query.
     - **Loop**:
       - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (right to left).
       - For each character `el` in `s1`:
         - If `el` is '>', it calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
         - If `el` is '<', it updates `suffZero` and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `suffZero` and `preOne`.
       - The results are stored in `ans`.
     - **Output**:
       - The function prints the results in `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the string `s1` to calculate the time for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
   - The logic for handling '>' and '<' characters is correctly implemented, taking into account the cumulative sums and the inversion of characters.
   - The function `func_1` is used appropriately to compute the necessary intermediate values.
   - The final results are printed in the correct format.
