Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at the last position of `s1` is '<', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n`, `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, 1)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `oneInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `zr` is 1, so the function call is `func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- The result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` is multiplied by 2 and assigned to `oneInd`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
