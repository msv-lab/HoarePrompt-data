To determine the output state, let's analyze the code snippet and the initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if `el` is '>', or a list containing two elements: 0 and `n` if `el` is '<'.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
   ```

3. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
   - `func_1` is a function that takes two arguments: `suffZero` and `ol`. The specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we will assume it returns some value based on the inputs.

4. **Calculating the Result**:
   - We need to determine the value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
   - `suffZero` is a list that depends on the value of `el`:
     - If `el` is '>', `suffZero` is `[0]`.
     - If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is `[0, n]`.
   - `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.

5. **Possible Values of `suffZero`**:
   - If `el` is '>', `suffZero` is `[0]`.
   - If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is `[0, n]`.

6. **Possible Values of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`**:
   - If `el` is '>', `func_1([0], totalOne)` will return some value based on the function's logic.
   - If `el` is '<', `func_1([0, n], totalOne)` will return some value based on the function's logic.

7. **Assigning `zeroInd`**:
   - `zeroInd` will be `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the function's return value.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if `el` is '>', or a list containing two elements: 0 and `n` if `el` is '<', `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.**
