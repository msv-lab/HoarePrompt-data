Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if `el` is '>', or a list containing two elements: 0 and `n` if `el` is '<', `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is equal to 2 * `suffZero[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * suffZero[-1]`.
- `suffZero[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `suffZero`.
- If `el` is '>', `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, so `suffZero[-1]` is 0, and `zeroInd` becomes 2 * 0 = 0.
- If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`, so `suffZero[-1]` is `n`, and `zeroInd` becomes 2 * `n`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
