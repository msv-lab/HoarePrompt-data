Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, but the last element has been removed, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, and if `ol` (which is equal to `totalOne`) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is 0), `ans[n-1]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd` (where `zeroInd` is 0 and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`), otherwise `ans[n-1]` is set to `n + 1 - fi` (where `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`), and `i` is updated to `n - 2`.**
