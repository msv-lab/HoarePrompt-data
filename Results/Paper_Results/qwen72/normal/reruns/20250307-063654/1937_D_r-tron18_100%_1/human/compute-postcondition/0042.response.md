Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if `el` is '>', or a list containing two elements: 0 and `n` if `el` is '<', `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is equal to 2 * `suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is equal to `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` calculates the value of `oneInd` by calling the function `func_1` twice with different arguments.
- The value of `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the `suffZero` list.
- The value of `oneInd` is the sum of the results of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
