Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at the last position of `s1` is '<', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n`**.

Explanation:
- `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`.
- `zeroInd` is assigned the value of `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`.
- `suffZero[-1]` is `n` and `suffZero[-2]` is 0.
- Therefore, `zeroInd` is `n + 0`, which simplifies to `n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
