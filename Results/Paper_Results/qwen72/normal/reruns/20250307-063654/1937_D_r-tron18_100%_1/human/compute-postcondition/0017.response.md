Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the character at the last position of `s1` and `el` is equal to '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is equal to `func_1(preOne, 0) + func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is equal to `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`**

Explanation:
- `fi` is assigned the value `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- Since `zr` is 0, `fi` becomes `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
