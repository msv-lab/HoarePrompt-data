Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', or remains unchanged if `el` is '<'. `suffZero` is a list where the last element is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1` if `el` is '<'. `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. `i` is `n - 3`, and `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne`. `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. `zeroInd` is equal to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` introduces a new variable `zeroInd` and assigns it the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- The function `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is called with the arguments `suffZero` and `ol`.
- The value of `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`) remain unchanged from the initial state.
