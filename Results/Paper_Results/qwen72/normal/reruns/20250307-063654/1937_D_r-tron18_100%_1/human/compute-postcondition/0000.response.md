Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'**

Explanation:
- The code creates a list `pre` using a list comprehension.
- The list comprehension iterates over the string `s1` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the element `el` at each position.
- For each character in `s1` that is equal to '>', the list `pre` is populated with the index `i + 1`, which converts the 0-based index to a 1-based index.
- The values of `s1` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The list `pre` contains the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
