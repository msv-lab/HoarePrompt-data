Output State: **The loop has executed `n` times, and `i` is -1. `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. `totalOne` is 0, indicating that all '>' characters have been processed. `preOne` is an empty list, as all elements have been removed during the loop execution. `suffZero` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters encountered during the loop, starting from 0. `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element has been updated based on the logic within the loop, reflecting the calculated values for each position in `s1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all `n` iterations, and the index `i` is now -1.
- The string `s1` remains unchanged, still consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'.
- The variable `totalOne` is 0, indicating that all '>' characters in `s1` have been processed.
- The list `preOne` is now empty, as each element was removed during the loop execution.
- The list `suffZero` contains the cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters encountered during the loop, starting from 0.
- The list `ans` has been fully populated with the calculated values for each position in `s1` based on the logic within the loop.
