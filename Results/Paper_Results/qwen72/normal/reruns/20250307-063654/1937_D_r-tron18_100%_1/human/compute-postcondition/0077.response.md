Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', or remains unchanged if `el` is '<'. `suffZero` is a list where the last element is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` and the length of `suffZero` is increased by 1. `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. `i` is `n - 3`, and `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne`. `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. `zeroInd` is equal to `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`. `oneInd` is equal to 2 * func_1(preOne, zr).**
