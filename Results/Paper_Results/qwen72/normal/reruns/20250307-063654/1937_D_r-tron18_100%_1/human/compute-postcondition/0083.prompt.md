Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if `el` is '>', or a list containing two elements: 0 and `n` if `el` is '<', `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is decreased by 1, the last element of `preOne` is removed, and if `ol` (which is equal to `totalOne`) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is 0), `ans[n-1]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd` (where `zeroInd` is 0 and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`), otherwise `ans[n-1]` is set to `n + 1 - fi` (where `fi` is `func_1(preOne, 1) - func_1(preOne, 0)`), and `i` is updated to `n - 2`. If `el` is '<', the character at the last position of `s1` is '<', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `n`, and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]` if `zr` > `ol` or `2 * func_1(preOne, 1)` if `zr` <= `ol`. If `zr` <= `ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `n + 1 + zeroInd - oneInd`, and if `zr` > `ol`, the last element of `ans` is set to `n - (2 * preOne[-1])`. In both cases, `i` is `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, and the last element of `preOne` is removed. If `el` is '<', `totalOne` remains unchanged, and an additional element is appended to `suffZero`, which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`. In both cases, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, and `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne` minus 1 if `el` is '>', or equal to `totalOne` if `el` is '<'. `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is calculated based on the updated values of `ol` and `zr`. If `el` is '<' and `zr` <= `ol`, `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. If `el` is '<' and `zr` > `ol`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2 if `el` is '>', or remains unchanged if `el` is '<'. `suffZero` is a list where the last element is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` and the length of `suffZero` is increased by 1 if `el` is '<'. `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. `i` is `n - 3`, and `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne` minus 1 if `el` is '>', or equal to `totalOne` if `el` is '<'. `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. If `el` is '>', the function updates `totalOne` to be the number of '>' characters minus 2. If `el` is '<', the function updates `suffZero` and sets `ans[i]` based on the relationship between `zr` and `ol`: if `zr <= ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
