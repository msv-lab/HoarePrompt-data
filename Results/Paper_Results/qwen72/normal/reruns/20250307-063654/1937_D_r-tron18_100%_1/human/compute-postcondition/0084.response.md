To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Loop Execution**: The loop has executed `n` times.
2. **Variable `i`**: `i` is -1.
3. **String `s1`**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'.
4. **List `pre`**: `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'.
5. **Variable `totalOne`**: `totalOne` is 0, indicating that all '>' characters have been processed.
6. **List `preOne`**: `preOne` is an empty list, as all elements have been removed during the loop execution.
7. **List `suffZero`**: `suffZero` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters encountered during the loop, starting from 0.
8. **List `ans`**: `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element has been updated based on the logic within the loop, reflecting the calculated values for each position in `s1`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the final state of `ans`:

- The loop has processed all characters in `s1`.
- All '>' characters have been processed, and their indices have been removed from `preOne`.
- The `suffZero` list contains cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters.
- The `ans` list has been updated based on the loop logic.

Since `totalOne` is 0, it means all '>' characters have been processed, and the loop has completed its execution. The `ans` list will contain the final calculated values for each position in `s1`.

However, without the exact loop logic, we can't determine the exact values in `ans`. But we can infer that `ans` will be a list of integers, each reflecting the result of the loop's processing for the corresponding position in `s1`.

Given the context, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Output: **[ans[0] ans[1] ... ans[n-1]] (where each ans[i] is the calculated value for the i-th position in the string s1)**

This format indicates that the output will be a sequence of integers, each representing the processed value for the corresponding position in the string `s1`.
