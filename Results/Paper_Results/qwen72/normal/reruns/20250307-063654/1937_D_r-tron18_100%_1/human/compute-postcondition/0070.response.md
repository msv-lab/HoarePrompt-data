Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', or remains unchanged if `el` is '<'. `suffZero` is a list where the last element is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1` if `el` is '<'. `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. `i` is `n - 3`, and `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne`. `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. If `ol` <= `zr`, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `oneInd` is `2 * pre[-1] - func_1(pre, 1)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `2 * suffZero[-1] - (func_1(pre, zr) + func_1(pre, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)) + n + 1 - (func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr))`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.**
