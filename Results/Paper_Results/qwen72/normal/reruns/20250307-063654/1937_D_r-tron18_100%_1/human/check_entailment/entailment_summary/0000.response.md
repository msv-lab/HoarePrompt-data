### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains a character, either '<' or '>'. A pinball is placed on a cell and moves according to the direction of the character. The character is then inverted, and the process repeats until the pinball leaves the grid.
   - We need to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell, starting from the initial configuration of the grid.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:**
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of a list `arr` and the element at a specific index determined by `times`. It is used to help in the calculation of the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The function is correct and does not modify the input list, which is important for maintaining the integrity of the data.

   - **func_2:**
     - This function processes the string `s1` to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.
     - It uses two lists, `pre` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
     - The `pre` list contains the 1-based indices of '>' characters.
     - The `preOne` list is the cumulative sum of the `pre` list, initialized with 0.
     - The `suffZero` list is used to keep track of the cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters encountered from the right.
     - The function iterates over the string from right to left, updating the `ans` list with the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.
     - The logic for calculating the time is based on the positions and cumulative sums of '>' and '<' characters, which is consistent with the problem's rules.

3. **Algorithm Verification:**
   - The algorithm correctly handles the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.
   - The use of `pre` and `suffZero` lists ensures that the cumulative sums are efficiently calculated and used to determine the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate the necessary differences in cumulative sums, which are then used to determine the time for each cell.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when the grid contains only '<' or only '>' characters.
   - The function also handles the case where the grid is of length 1, which is a valid input as per the problem constraints.

5. **Output:**
   - The output is a list of times for each cell, which is printed as required by the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell, and the output is consistent with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
