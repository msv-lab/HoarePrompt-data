Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`. `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0. `suffZero` is a list with an additional element appended, which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`. `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. `i` is `n - 2`. `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne`. `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. If `zr` <= `ol`, `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[n - 2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**
