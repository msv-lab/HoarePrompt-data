Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd`, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is the character at the last position of `s1` and `el` is equal to '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- The value of `i` is `n - 1`, so `ans[n - 1]` is updated to `0 - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
