Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', or remains unchanged if `el` is '<'. `suffZero` is a list where the last element is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1` if `el` is '<'. `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd`. `i` is `n - 3`, and `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne`. `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. `zeroInd` is equal to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`. `oneInd` is equal to `2 * pre[-1] - func_1(pre, 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- The value of `i` is `n - 3`.
- The value of `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`.
- The value of `ol` is `totalOne`.
- The value of `zr` is the length of `suffZero` minus 1.
- The value of `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- The value of `oneInd` is `2 * pre[-1] - func_1(pre, 1)`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
