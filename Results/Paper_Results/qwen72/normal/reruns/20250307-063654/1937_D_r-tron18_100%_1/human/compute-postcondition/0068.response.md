Output State: **`oneInd` is equal to `func_1(pre, zr) + func_1(pre, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', or remains unchanged if `el` is '<', `suffZero` is a list where the last element is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1` if `el` is '<', `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1, `zeroInd` is equal to 2 * `suffZero[-1]`, `fi` is equal to `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**. 

The code snippet assigns the value of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` to the variable `fi`. All other variables remain unchanged.
