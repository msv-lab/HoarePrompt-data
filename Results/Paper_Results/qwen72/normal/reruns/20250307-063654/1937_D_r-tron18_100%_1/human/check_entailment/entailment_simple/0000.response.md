### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s1` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - The function is used to compute the cumulative effects of the pinball's movements and the grid's state changes.
   - The logic ensures that the index is always valid, as `max(-n, -1 - times)` will never exceed the bounds of the list `arr`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
   - It initializes `pre` with the 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.
   - It uses `accumulate` to create `preOne`, which is a list of cumulative sums of the indices in `pre`.
   - It initializes `suffZero` with a single element `0` and `ans` with a list of zeros of length `n`.

4. **Loop through the grid**:
   - The loop iterates backward from the last cell to the first cell.
   - For each cell `i`:
     - If the cell contains '>', it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
     - It updates the `ans` list with the calculated time.
     - It removes the last element from `preOne` and decrements `totalOne`.
     - If the cell contains '<', it updates `suffZero` with the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters encountered so far.
     - It calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums in `suffZero` and `preOne`.
     - It updates the `ans` list with the calculated time.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all cells, the program prints the `ans` list for the current test case.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified.
- The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position is consistent with the problem description.
- The use of cumulative sums and the `func_1` function ensures that the program efficiently computes the required times without redundant calculations.
- The program correctly updates the grid state by inverting the direction of the pinball after each move.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
