The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. It processes the string to calculate a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element `ans[i]` represents a specific value derived from the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The function prints the elements of `ans` and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `s1` remains unchanged, `pre` is a list of the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is an empty list, and `suffZero` is a list containing cumulative sums of the indices of '<' characters encountered.
