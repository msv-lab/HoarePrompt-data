Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list with an additional element appended, which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1, `zeroInd` is 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1), `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans[i]` is now `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the provided functions and lists.
