The loop head in the given task is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. This means the loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` down to `0`, decrementing by 1 each time. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0
- `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if `el` is '>', or a list containing two elements: 0 and `n` if `el` is '<'
- `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if `el` is '>', or a list containing two elements: 0 and `n` if `el` is '<', `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 2`**
