To determine the output state, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - The character at the last position of `s1` is '<'.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is 1.
   - `zr` is greater than `ol`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
   ```

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The function `func_1` is called twice with different arguments.
   - The first call is `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)`.
   - The second call is `func_1(suffZero, 1)`.
   - The result of the first call is multiplied by 2.
   - The result of the second call is subtracted from the result of the first call.
   - The final result is assigned to `zeroInd`.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - Since `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`, and `func_1` is not defined, we can assume it is a function that returns an element from the list based on the index provided.
   - `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` will return `suffZero[ol + 1]`. Given that `ol` is `totalOne` and `suffZero` only has two elements, `ol + 1` will always be 1 or greater. Since `suffZero` only has two elements, `suffZero[1]` is `n`.
   - `func_1(suffZero, 1)` will return `suffZero[1]`, which is `n`.

5. **Calculating `zeroInd`:**
   - `zeroInd = 2 * n - n`
   - `zeroInd = n`

6. **Output State:**
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
   - `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0.
   - `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - The character at the last position of `s1` is '<'.
   - `ol` is `totalOne`.
   - `zr` is 1.
   - `zr` is greater than `ol`.
   - `zeroInd` is `n`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at the last position of `s1` is '<', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n`.**
