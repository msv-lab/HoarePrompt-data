Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', or remains unchanged if `el` is '<'. `suffZero` is a list where the last element is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1` if `el` is '<'. `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. `i` is `n - 3`, and `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne`. `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1. The value of `ans[i]` is set based on the conditions described. `preOne` is a list with its last element removed.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `ans[i]` is determined by the conditions provided in the initial state, but the exact value is not recalculated here as it is not part of the code snippet provided.
- The length of `preOne` is now one less than it was before the execution of the code snippet.
