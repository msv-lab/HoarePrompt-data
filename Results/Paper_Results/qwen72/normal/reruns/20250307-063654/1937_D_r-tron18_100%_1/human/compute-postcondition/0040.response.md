Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0 if `el` is '>', or a list containing two elements: 0 and `n` if `el` is '<', `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1), `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the provided functions and lists, but their exact values depend on the specific values of `suffZero` and `preOne`.
- The index `i` is `n - 2`, and the character `el` at this index in `s1` is either '<' or '>'.
- The list `suffZero` contains either a single element 0 or two elements 0 and `n` depending on whether `el` is '>' or '<'.
- The variable `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, and `zr` is the length of `suffZero` minus 1.
- The variable `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, and `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- The final value of `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.
