Output State: **`oneInd` is updated to `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `fi` is calculated as the difference between `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` and `func_1(preOne, zr)`. The value of `oneInd` remains as it was updated in the initial state, and all other variables remain unchanged.
