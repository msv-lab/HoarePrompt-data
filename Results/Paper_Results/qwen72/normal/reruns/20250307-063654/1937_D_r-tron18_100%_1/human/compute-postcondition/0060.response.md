Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', or remains unchanged if `el` is '<'. `suffZero` is a list where the last element is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1` if `el` is '<'. `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. `i` is `n - 3`, and `el` is the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne` minus 1 if `el` is '>', or equal to `totalOne` if `el` is '<'. `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1.** 

The code snippet `el = s1[i]` assigns the character at index `n - 3` in the string `s1` to the variable `el`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `el` is now the character at index `n - 3` in `s1`.
