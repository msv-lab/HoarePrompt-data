Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and the character at the last position of `s1` is '<'.**

Explanation:
- The code `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)` appends a new value to the list `suffZero`.
- The last element of `suffZero` before the operation is 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- The new value appended to `suffZero` is `0 + (n - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
- Therefore, `suffZero` now contains two elements: 0 and `n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
