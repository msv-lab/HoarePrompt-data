The code snippet assigns the value `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` to the variable `oneInd`. To understand the output state, we need to consider the initial state and the impact of this assignment.

- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>'.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0.
- `suffZero` is a list with an additional element appended, which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is equal to the length of `suffZero` minus 1.
- `zeroInd` is the sum of the last two elements of `suffZero`.

The function `func_1(preOne, zr)` is called with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments. The result of this function is then multiplied by 2 and assigned to `oneInd`.

Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `oneInd`. However, we can state that `oneInd` is now equal to `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
