Postcondition: ***`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing two elements: 0 and `n`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If `zr` <= `ol`, `ans[i]` is set to `n + 1 + zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `n` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `zr` > `ol`, the last element of `ans` is set to `n - (2 * preOne[-1])`. In both cases, `i` is `n - 1`, the character at the last position of `s1` is '<', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is 1, `zeroInd` is `n`, and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]` if `zr` > `ol` or `2 * func_1(preOne, 1)` if `zr` <= `ol`.***
