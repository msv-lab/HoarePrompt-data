Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of the characters in `s1` that are equal to '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list with an additional element appended, which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is the character at index `n - 2` in `s1`.**

In natural language: The code appends a new element to the `suffZero` list. This new element is the sum of the last element in `suffZero` and the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
