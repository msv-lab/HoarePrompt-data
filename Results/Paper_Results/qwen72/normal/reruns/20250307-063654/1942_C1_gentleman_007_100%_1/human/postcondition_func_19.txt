The function `func_20` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns the integer part of the square root of `x`. If `x` is 0 or 1, it returns `x` itself. For `x` greater than 1, the function uses a binary search approach to find the largest integer `mid` such that `mid * mid` is less than or equal to `x`. The final state of the program is that `mid` is the integer part of the square root of `x`, and the function returns this value.
