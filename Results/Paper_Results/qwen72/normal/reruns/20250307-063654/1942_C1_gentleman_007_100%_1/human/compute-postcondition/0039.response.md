Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started.
- `q` is a deque with the front element removed and all unvisited nodes from `graph[ver]` appended to the back.
- `q` must contain at least one element.
- `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1.
- `ver` is now the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ver, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`ver`**: This variable holds the value of the element that was at the front of the deque `q` before the `popleft()` operation. Since `q` has at least one element, `ver` is guaranteed to have a value.
2. **`end=' '`**: This parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `ver` followed by a space.
- The value of `ver` is the element that was at the front of the deque `q` before the `popleft()` operation.

### Final Output:
Output: **[ver] (where [ver] is the value of the element that was at the front of the deque `q` before the `popleft()` operation)**
