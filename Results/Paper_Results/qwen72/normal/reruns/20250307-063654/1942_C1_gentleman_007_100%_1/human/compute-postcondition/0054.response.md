Output State: **The deque `q` is empty, and `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in the adjacency lists of the vertices processed by the loop are set to 1.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues until the deque `q` is empty, meaning all vertices that were added to `q` have been processed.
- The variable `ver` will hold the value of the last vertex processed by the loop before `q` became empty.
- The list `vis` will be updated to mark all vertices that were processed by the loop as visited (1). This includes the initial vertex and all its reachable vertices that were not already visited when the loop started.
- The graph `graph` remains unchanged as it is only used to look up adjacency lists and is not modified by the loop.
