Output State: **`ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least 3 elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`, `vis[ver]` is 1, `vis[node]` is 1, and `node` is appended to the end of `q`.** 

The code snippet `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the end of the deque `q`. Since the initial state specifies that `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]` and `vis[node]` is set to 1 if it was 0, the output state reflects that `node` is now at the end of the deque `q` and `vis[node]` is 1. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
