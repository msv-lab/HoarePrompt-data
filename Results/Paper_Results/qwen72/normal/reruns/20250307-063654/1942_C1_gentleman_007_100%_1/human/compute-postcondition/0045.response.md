The only objects in the loop head are `node` and `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` contains more than one element, the loop will execute again with the next element in `graph[ver]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ver` is the value that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, `graph[ver]` contains at least one element, and `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[ver]` must still contain at least one element (which is now the second element, since the first one has been processed), and `node` will be set to this next element.

State: **`ver` is the value that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, `graph[ver]` contains at least one element, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`**
