Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started.
   - `q` is a deque with the front element removed and possibly additional elements appended.
   - `q` must have at least one element for the loop to execute one more time.
   - `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` has been fully processed.
   - `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ver, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `ver` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - `ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started. This means `ver` is the element that was at the front of `q` and has been processed (i.e., removed from the front of `q` and its neighbors have been marked as visited).

4. **Output:**
   - The value of `ver` will be printed, followed by a space.

Given the initial state, the value of `ver` is known to be the element that was at the front of the deque `q` before the loop started. Since the exact value of `ver` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the initial state.

Output: **ver (where ver is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started)**
