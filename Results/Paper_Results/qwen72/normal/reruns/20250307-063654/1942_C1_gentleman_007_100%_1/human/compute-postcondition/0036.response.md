Output State: **`ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed and all unvisited nodes from `graph[ver]` appended to the back, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1.**

In natural language, after the loop has finished all its iterations:
- The variable `ver` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
- The deque `q` has had its front element (which was `ver`) removed. Additionally, all nodes from `graph[ver]` that were not already visited (i.e., `vis[node]` was initially 0) have been appended to the back of `q`.
- The list `vis` has been updated such that `vis[ver]` is set to 1, and for every `node` in `graph[ver]`, `vis[node]` is also set to 1, indicating that all these nodes have been visited.
