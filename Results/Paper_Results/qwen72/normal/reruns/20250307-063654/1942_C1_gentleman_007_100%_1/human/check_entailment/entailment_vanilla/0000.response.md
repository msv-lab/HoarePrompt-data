To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it solves the problem as described. The problem involves maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, given that Bessie has already chosen \( x \) vertices and you can choose no more than \( y \) additional vertices (where \( y = 0 \) in this version).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - Bessie has chosen \( x \) vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices and no additional vertices (since \( y = 0 \)).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - A triangle is formed by choosing 3 vertices of the polygon.
   - The diagonals must not intersect inside the polygon.
   - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from \( x \) vertices is \( x - 2 \) (since each triangle uses 3 vertices, and the first triangle uses 3 vertices, the second uses 1 additional vertex, and so on).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program contains several functions, but none of them directly address the problem of forming triangles from the chosen vertices.
   - The functions provided seem to be for various other purposes, such as:
     - `func_1` and `func_2` for reading input.
     - `func_3` and `func_4` for creating lists and 2D lists.
     - `func_5` and `func_6` for creating adjacency lists and matrices.
     - `func_7` to `func_19` for various mathematical and algorithmic operations (e.g., prime factorization, greatest common divisor, binary search).
     - `func_20` to `func_25` for operations like square root calculation, modular exponentiation, longest common subsequence, and graph traversal (DFS and BFS).

4. **Relevant Functions**:
   - The problem does not require any of the complex operations provided in the functions.
   - The solution can be derived directly from the number of chosen vertices \( x \).

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from \( x \) vertices is \( x - 2 \).
   - This is because the first triangle uses 3 vertices, and each subsequent triangle uses 1 additional vertex.

6. **Program Implementation**:
   - The program does not contain a function that directly computes \( x - 2 \).
   - The program is overly complex and does not address the problem at hand.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It lacks the necessary logic to compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake based on the given vertices. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
