The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `q`. If `len(q)` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is a deque with the front element removed and all unvisited nodes from `graph[ver]` appended to the back. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed and all unvisited nodes from `graph[ver]` appended to the back, `q` must contain at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1**
