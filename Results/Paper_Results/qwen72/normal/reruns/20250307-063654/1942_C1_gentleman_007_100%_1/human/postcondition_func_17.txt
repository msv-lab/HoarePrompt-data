The function `func_18` accepts a sorted list of integers `p` and an integer `x` within the range of values in `p`. It returns the index of the last element in `p` that is less than or equal to `x`. If `x` is less than the first element in `p`, it returns `-1`. If `x` is equal to the last element in `p`, it returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of `p`.
