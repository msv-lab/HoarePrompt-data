Output State: **`ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, and `node` appended to the end, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` has been fully processed and must have at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1, `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`, and the current value of `vis[node]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ver` remains unchanged.
- The deque `q` has the front element removed and now has `node` appended to the end.
- The structure of `graph` and the processed state of `graph[ver]` remain unchanged.
- The list `vis` remains unchanged in terms of the elements that are set to 1, but the specific value of `vis[node]` is still 0.
- The value of `node` remains the first element in `graph[ver]`.
