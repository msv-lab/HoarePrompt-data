Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed and all unvisited nodes from `graph[ver]` appended to the back, `q` must contain at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1, `ver` is now the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ver` is the value that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, `graph[ver]` contains at least one element, `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is `0`), `node` is marked as visited (`vis[node]` is `1`) and `node` is added to the end of `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ver` is the value that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, `graph[ver]` contains at least one element, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is 0, `q` now contains `node` at the end, and `vis[node]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ver` is the value that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, `graph[ver]` contains at least two elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` has been appended to the queue `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `node` remains unmodified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
