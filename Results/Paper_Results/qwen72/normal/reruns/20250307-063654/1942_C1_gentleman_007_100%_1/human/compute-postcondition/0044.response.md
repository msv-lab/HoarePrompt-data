Postcondition: ***`ver` is the value that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, `graph[ver]` contains at least one element, `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`. If `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is `0`), `node` is marked as visited (`vis[node]` is `1`) and `node` is added to the end of `q`.***
