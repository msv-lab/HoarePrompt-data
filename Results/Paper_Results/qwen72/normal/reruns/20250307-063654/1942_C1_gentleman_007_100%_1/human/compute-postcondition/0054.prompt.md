Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element represents the adjacency list of a vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1, and `q` is a deque containing the vertex `ver`.
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed and possibly additional elements appended, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` has been fully processed, and `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed and all unvisited nodes from `graph[ver]` appended to the back, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After all iterations of the loop, `q` will contain all unvisited nodes from `graph[ver]` appended to the back, and `vis` will be updated to mark all these nodes as visited (1). The value of `ver` will be the next element that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, and the loop will have processed all elements in `graph[ver]` that were not already visited.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
