The function `func_14` accepts a dictionary `d` where each key is an integer and each value is the number of occurrences of that key. It calculates and returns the sum of `i` raised to the power of `d[i] - 1` multiplied by `i - 1` for each key `i` in the dictionary. The dictionary `d` remains unchanged after the function execution.
