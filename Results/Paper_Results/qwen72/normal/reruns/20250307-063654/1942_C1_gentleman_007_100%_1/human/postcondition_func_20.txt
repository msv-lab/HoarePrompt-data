The function `func_21` accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `mod`, where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, and `mod` is a positive integer. It returns the result of `a` raised to the power of `b` modulo `mod`. After the function concludes, `a` is modified to be `a % mod`, `b` is 0, and `mod` remains unchanged. The final state of the program includes the returned value being the result of the modular exponentiation, and `b` being 0.
