The only objects in the loop head are `node`, `graph`, and `ver`. The loop iterates over the elements in `graph[ver]`, so for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `graph[ver]` that has not been processed yet.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started.
- `graph[ver]` has been fully processed and must have at least two elements.
- `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `node` must be the next element in `graph[ver]`. Since `graph[ver]` has at least two elements and has been fully processed, the next `node` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `graph[ver]` has at least two elements, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]` that has not been processed yet, `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1.**
