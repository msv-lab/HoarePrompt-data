The function `func_25` accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the vertex `ver`, printing each visited vertex. The function modifies the `vis` list to mark all visited vertices as 1. The function does not return any value, but it ensures that the deque `q` is empty and the `vis` list reflects the visited status of all processed vertices.
