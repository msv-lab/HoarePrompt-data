### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, and Bessie has already chosen \( x \) vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing no more than \( y \) additional vertices.
   - In this version, \( y = 0 \), so we can only use the vertices Bessie has already chosen.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the given code is to count the number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.
   - The initial count is set to \( x - 2 \), which is the minimum number of triangles that can be formed by connecting \( x \) vertices in a polygon.
   - The code then checks for additional triangles that can be formed by looking at the differences between consecutive vertices in the sorted list of chosen vertices.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This is used to read the test case parameters.
   - **Function 2**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers, returning a list. This is used to read the chosen vertices.
   - **Function 3**: Creates a list of \( n \) elements, each initialized to \( v \). This function is not used in the given code.

   - **Function 16**: Computes a list of derangements. This function is not used in the given code.
   - **Function 17**: Finds the index of an element in a sorted list. This function is not used in the given code.
   - **Function 18**: Finds the index of the last element in a sorted list that is less than or equal to \( x \). This function is not used in the given code.
   - **Function 19**: Finds the index of the first element in a sorted list that is greater than or equal to \( x \). This function is not used in the given code.
   - **Function 20**: Computes the integer part of the square root of \( x \). This function is not used in the given code.
   - **Function 21**: Computes \( a \) raised to the power of \( b \) modulo \( mod \). This function is not used in the given code.
   - **Function 22**: Computes the longest common subsequence of two lists. This function is not used in the given code.
   - **Function 23**: Computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a list. This function is not used in the given code.
   - **Function 24**: Performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph. This function is not used in the given code.
   - **Function 25**: Performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph. This function is not used in the given code.

4. **Main Code Analysis**:
   - The main code reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It initializes the answer to \( x - 2 \).
   - It reads the chosen vertices and sorts them.
   - It checks for additional triangles by looking at the differences between consecutive vertices.
   - It prints the final answer for each test case.
