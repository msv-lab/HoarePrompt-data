The function `func_24` accepts a vertex `ver` and performs a depth-first traversal of the graph starting from `ver`. It marks all reachable vertices as visited by setting their corresponding `vis` values to 1. The function does not return any value but prints the vertices in the order they are visited. After the function concludes, the `stack` is empty, and the `vis` list reflects the visitation status of all vertices that were reachable from the initial `ver`.
