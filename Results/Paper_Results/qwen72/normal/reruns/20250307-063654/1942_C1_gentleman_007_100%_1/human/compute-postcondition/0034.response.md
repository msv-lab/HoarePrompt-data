Output State: **`ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `graph[ver]` has at least two elements, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]` that has not been processed yet, `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1, `q` now includes `node` at its back.**

The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the `node` has been visited. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
