Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with given vertices. The functions in the program are not used to solve the problem and seem to be unrelated to the task at hand. For example, functions like `func_11` and `func_13` are for generating prime numbers and factorizing numbers, which are not relevant to the problem of triangulating a polygon.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to implement a function that calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the given vertices of a polygon. This typically involves sorting the vertices, considering the polygon's structure, and using a combinatorial approach to count the possible triangles.

Here's a simplified version of what a correct solution might look like:

```python
def max_triangles(n, x, vertices):
    vertices.sort()
    vertices.append(vertices[0] + n)  # To handle wrap-around
    max_triangles = 0
    for i in range(x):
        # Calculate the number of triangles that can be formed between vertices[i] and vertices[i+1]
        segment_length = vertices[i + 1] - vertices[i] - 1
        max_triangles += max(0, segment_length - 1)
    return max_triangles

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    vertices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_triangles(n, x, vertices))
```

This function `max_triangles` sorts the vertices, adds a wrap-around vertex to handle the circular nature of the polygon, and then iterates through the segments between chosen vertices to count the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed. This is a more appropriate approach to solving the given problem.
