This function is not directly related to the problem description provided. However, for the problem, the preconditions are: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n, x, and y are integers for each test case where 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0; the list of x integers contains distinct values ranging from 1 to n.
