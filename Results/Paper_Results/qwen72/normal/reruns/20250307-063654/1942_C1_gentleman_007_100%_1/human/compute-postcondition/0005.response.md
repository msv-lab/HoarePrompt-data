To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`.
- `q` is a deque with the front element removed.
- `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists.
- `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ver, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`ver`**: This variable holds the value that was at the front of the deque `q` before the front element was removed. Since `ver` is explicitly defined as this value, we know that it will be printed.
2. **`end=' '`**: The `end` parameter in the `print` function specifies that the output should be followed by a space instead of a newline. This means that the value of `ver` will be printed followed by a space.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the value of `ver` followed by a space. The exact value of `ver` is not provided in the initial state, but it is known to be the value that was at the front of the deque `q` before the front element was removed.

Output: **[ver] (where [ver] is the value that was at the front of the deque `q` before the front element was removed)**
