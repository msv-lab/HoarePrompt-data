Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` and `b` are lists of integers or characters, and both are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `len(b) + 1` elements, and each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements from `dp[1][1]` to `dp[len(a)][len(b)]`. These elements are updated based on the loop logic: for each `i` from 1 to `len(a)` and each `j` from 1 to `len(b)`, if `a[i - 1]` is equal to `b[j - 1]`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][j - 1]`. `i` is `len(a)`, and `j` is `len(b)`. `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while i != 0 and j != 0:
    if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
        i -= 1
    else:
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
        l.append(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` and `b` are lists of integers or characters, and both are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `len(b) + 1` elements, and each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements from `dp[1][1]` to `dp[len(a)][len(b)]`. `i` is `len(a)` and `j` is either `len(b) - 1` or `len(b)`. `l` is an empty list if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` or `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`. Otherwise, `l` contains the last element of `a`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `j` is either `len(b)` or `len(b) - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a` and `b` are lists of integers or characters, and both are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `len(b) + 1` elements, and each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements from `dp[1][1]` to `dp[len(a)][len(b)]`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, and `j` is either `len(b) - 2` or `len(b) - 1`. `l` remains an empty list if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` or `dp[i - 1][j]`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `j` is either `len(b) - 1` or `len(b) - 2`. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `j` is either `len(b) - 1` or `len(b) - 2`, and `l` contains the last element of `a` if `dp[i][j + 1]` is not equal to `dp[i][j]` or `dp[i - 1][j + 1]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` and `b` are lists of integers or characters, and both are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `len(b) + 1` elements, and each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements from `dp[1][1]` to `dp[len(a)][len(b)]`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, and `j` is either `len(b) - 3` or `len(b) - 2`, and `j` is now `j - 1`. `l` remains an empty list if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` or `dp[i - 1][j]`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `j` is either `len(b) - 2` or `len(b) - 3`, and `l` contains the last element of `a` if `dp[i][j + 1]` is not equal to `dp[i][j]` or `dp[i - 1][j + 1]`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is now `len(a) - 1` or `len(a) - 2`, and `j` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is decreased by 1, and `j` is decreased by 1. In both cases, `l` remains an empty list if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` or `dp[i - 1][j]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
