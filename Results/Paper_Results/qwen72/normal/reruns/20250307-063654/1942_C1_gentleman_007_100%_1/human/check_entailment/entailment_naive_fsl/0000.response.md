Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake from a regular polygon with given vertices. The functions listed in the program are not relevant to the problem at hand, and there is no logic implemented to handle the input and output as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
