Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed and possibly additional elements appended, and `q` must have at least one element for the loop to execute one more time, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` has been fully processed, and `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed. If `vis[node]` is not set to 1, `node` is appended to the end of `q`, and `vis[node]` is set to 1. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` has been fully processed and must have at least one element. `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1. `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` has been fully processed and must have at least two elements. `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1. If `vis[node]` was initially 0, then `node` is appended to the back of `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains 1 and `node` is not appended to `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `graph[ver]` has at least two elements, `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]` that has not been processed yet, `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1. If `vis[node]` is not set to 1, `q` now includes `node` at its back.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
