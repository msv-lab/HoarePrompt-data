The only objects in the loop head are `node`, `graph`, and `ver`. For the loop to execute, `graph[ver]` must be a non-empty iterable (e.g., a list or a set). The state of `ver` and `graph` must be such that `graph[ver]` contains at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`.
- `q` is a deque with the front element removed.
- `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists.
- `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `graph[ver]` is non-empty. The variable `node` will be the first element in `graph[ver]`.

State: **`ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must be non-empty, `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`, `vis[ver]` is 1**
