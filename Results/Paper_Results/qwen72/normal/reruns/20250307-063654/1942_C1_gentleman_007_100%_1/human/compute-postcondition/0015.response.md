The only objects in the loop head are the variables `node` and the list `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[ver]` must have at least 2 elements, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[ver]` must have at least 3 elements, and `node` will be the third element in `graph[ver]`.

State: **`ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least 3 elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`, `vis[ver]` is 1. If `vis[node]` is 0, then `vis[node]` is set to 1 and `node` is appended to the end of `q`.**
