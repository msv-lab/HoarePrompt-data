The function `func_8` accepts a list of lists `l` with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each inner list has the same length. It returns a new list of lists `p` with dimensions `(n + 1)` x `(m + 1)`. The first row and the first column of `p` are all zeros. Each element `p[i][j]` (for `i` from 1 to `n` and `j` from 1 to `m`) is calculated as the sum of the element `l[i-1][j-1]` and the values from the previous row and column in `p`, minus the value from the previous row and column. The original list `l` remains unchanged.
