The function `func_15` accepts two parameters, `n` (a non-negative integer) and `mod` (a positive integer), and returns a list `f` of `n + 1` elements. The first element of the list is 1, and each subsequent element is the factorial of the index `i` (from 1 to `n`), taken modulo `mod` twice. The final state of the program is that `f` contains the sequence of values [1, (1 * 1) % mod % mod, (1 * 2) % mod % mod, ..., (1 * n!) % mod % mod].
