The function `func_12` accepts an integer `num` greater than 1 and a list or dictionary `Prime_array` where the keys or indices are integers and the values are prime numbers. It returns a dictionary `d` where the keys are the prime factors of the original `num` and the values are the counts of how many times each prime factor divides `num`. The function modifies `num` to 1 by repeatedly dividing it by its prime factors, and `Prime_array` remains unchanged.
