Postcondition: ***`ver` is the value that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, `graph[ver]` contains at least two elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`. If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` has been appended to the queue `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `node` remains unmodified.***
