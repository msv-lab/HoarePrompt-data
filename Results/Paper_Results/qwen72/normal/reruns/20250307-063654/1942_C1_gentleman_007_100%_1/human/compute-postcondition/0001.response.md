Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where each element represents the adjacency list of a vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 0 if vertex `i` has not been visited, and 1 if it has been visited, `q` is a deque containing the vertex `ver`.**

The vertex `ver` has been added to the deque `q`, making `q` no longer empty. The states of `ver`, `graph`, and `vis` remain unchanged.
