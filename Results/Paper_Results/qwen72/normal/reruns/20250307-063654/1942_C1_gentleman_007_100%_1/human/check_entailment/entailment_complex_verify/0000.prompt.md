You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the string `s` containing the elements of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in the correct order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_22` accepts two non-empty lists `a` and `b` of integers or characters. It computes the longest common subsequence (LCS) of `a` and `b` and returns this LCS as a string in the correct order. The input lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.

#Function 23:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_23(arr):
    l = []
    for i in arr:
        pos = bisect_left(l, i)
        
        if pos == len(l):
            l.append(i)
        else:
            l[pos] = i
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of integers that contains the longest increasing subsequence of `arr` in ascending order.
    return len(l)
    #The program returns the length of the list `l`, which contains the longest increasing subsequence of `arr` in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_23` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of `arr`. The function does not modify the input list `arr`. After the function concludes, the list `l` contains the elements of the LIS in ascending order, and the function returns the length of this list.

#Function 24:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, and graph is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the graph. vis is a list of integers where vis[i] is 0 if vertex i has not been visited, and 1 if it has been visited.
def func_24(ver):
    stack = []
    stack.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(stack):
        ver = stack.pop()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                stack.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the `stack` is empty. All nodes that were reachable from the initial `ver` and not initially visited have been visited, and their corresponding `vis` values are set to 1. The `ver` variable holds the last node that was processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_24` accepts a vertex `ver` and performs a depth-first traversal of the graph starting from `ver`. It marks all reachable vertices as visited by setting their corresponding `vis` values to 1. The function does not return any value but prints the vertices in the order they are visited. After the function concludes, the `stack` is empty, and the `vis` list reflects the visitation status of all vertices that were reachable from the initial `ver`.

#Function 25:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in a graph, and graph is a dictionary or list of lists where each element represents the adjacency list of a vertex. vis is a list of integers where vis[i] is 0 if vertex i has not been visited, and 1 if it has been visited.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: The deque `q` is empty, and `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in the adjacency lists of the vertices processed by the loop are set to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_25` accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the vertex `ver`, printing each visited vertex. The function modifies the `vis` list to mark all visited vertices as 1. The function does not return any value, but it ensures that the deque `q` is empty and the `vis` list reflects the visited status of all processed vertices.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem of maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake from a regular polygon with given vertices. The functions listed in the program are not relevant to the problem at hand, and there is no logic implemented to handle the input and output as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
