Output State: **`ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least 2 elements, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`, `vis[ver]` is 1, `vis[node]` is 1, and `node` is appended to the end of `q`.**

Explanation:
- The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged:
  - `ver` is still the value that was at the front of the deque `q`.
  - `q` is still a deque with the front element removed.
  - `graph` is still a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least 2 elements.
  - `node` is still the second element in `graph[ver]`.
  - `vis[ver]` is still 1.
  - `node` is still appended to the end of `q`.
