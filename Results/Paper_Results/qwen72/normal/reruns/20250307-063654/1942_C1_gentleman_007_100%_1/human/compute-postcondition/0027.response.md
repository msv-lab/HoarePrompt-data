Postcondition: ***`ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed. If `vis[node]` is not set to 1, `node` is appended to the end of `q`, and `vis[node]` is set to 1. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` has been fully processed and must have at least one element. `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1. `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`.***
