Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers or characters, and both are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `len(b) + 1` elements, and each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements from `dp[1][1]` to `dp[len(a)][len(b)]`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a)`, and `j` is either `len(b) - 2` or `len(b) - 1`. `l` remains an empty list if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]` or `dp[i - 1][j]`. If `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `j` is either `len(b) - 1` or `len(b) - 2`. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `j` is either `len(b) - 1` or `len(b) - 2`, and `l` contains the last element of `a` if `dp[i][j + 1]` is not equal to `dp[i][j]` or `dp[i - 1][j + 1]`. `i` is now `len(a) - 1` or `len(a) - 2`.**
