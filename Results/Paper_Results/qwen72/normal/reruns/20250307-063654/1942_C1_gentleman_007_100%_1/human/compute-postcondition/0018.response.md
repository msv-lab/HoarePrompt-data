Postcondition: ***`ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least 3 elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`, `vis[ver]` is 1. If `vis[node]` is 0, then `vis[node]` is set to 1 and `node` is appended to the end of `q`. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains 0.***
