Output State: **`ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least 3 elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`, `vis[ver]` is 1, `vis[node]` is 1, and `node` is appended to the end of `q`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1. All other conditions and variable states from the initial state remain unchanged. Thus, `vis[node]` is now 1, and the rest of the state is the same as the initial state.
