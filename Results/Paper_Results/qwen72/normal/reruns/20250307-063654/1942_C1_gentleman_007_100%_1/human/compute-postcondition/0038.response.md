Output State: **`ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed and all unvisited nodes from `graph[ver]` appended to the back, `q` must contain at least one element, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1, `ver` is now the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation.**
