The function `func_6` accepts two integers `n` and `m`, where `4 <= n <= 10^9` and `2 <= m <= min(n, 2 * 10^5)`. It returns a list of lists `l` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` initialized to 0. For each pair `(x, y)` returned by `func_1()` during `m` iterations, the elements `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` are set to 1. After the function concludes, `l` represents a symmetric adjacency matrix where the positions `(x, y)` and `(y, x)` are marked as 1 for each pair `(x, y)` generated by `func_1()`.
