Postcondition: ***`ver` is the value that was the new front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` has been fully processed and must have at least two elements. `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1. If `vis[node]` was initially 0, then `node` is appended to the back of `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains 1 and `node` is not appended to `q`.***
