Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must be non-empty, `node` is the first element in `graph[ver]`, and `vis[ver]` is 1. If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` is appended to the end of `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least 2 elements, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`, `vis[ver]` is 1. If `vis[node]` is 0, then `vis[node]` is set to 1 and `node` is appended to the end of `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least 3 elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`, `vis[ver]` is 1. If `vis[node]` is 0, then `vis[node]` is set to 1 and `node` is appended to the end of `q`. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
