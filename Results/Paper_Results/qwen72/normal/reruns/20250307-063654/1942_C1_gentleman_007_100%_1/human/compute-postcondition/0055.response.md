The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex in a graph. The function also implicitly uses two other parameters: `graph`, which is a dictionary or list of lists where each element represents the adjacency list of a vertex, and `vis`, which is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 0 if vertex `i` has not been visited, and 1 if it has been visited. However, these parameters are not explicitly listed in the function signature.

The function returns:
- Case_1: If `ver` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of `vis`, the function returns an error message indicating that the vertex is out of bounds.
- Case_2: If `ver` has already been visited (i.e., `vis[ver]` is 1), the function returns `False`.
- Case_3: If `ver` has not been visited (i.e., `vis[ver]` is 0), the function marks `ver` as visited by setting `vis[ver]` to 1 and returns `True`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `ver` representing a vertex in a graph. It returns an error message if `ver` is out of bounds, `False` if `ver` has already been visited, and `True` if `ver` is marked as visited.**
