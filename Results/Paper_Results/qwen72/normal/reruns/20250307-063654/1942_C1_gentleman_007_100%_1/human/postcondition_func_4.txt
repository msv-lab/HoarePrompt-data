The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= n, representing the number of vertex pairs chosen to form diagonals. It returns a list `l` of `n + 1` lists, where each inner list at index `x` and `y` (for each pair returned by `func_1()`) contains the corresponding `y` or `x` value from the pairs returned by `func_1()`. The length of each inner list at these indices will be equal to the number of times `x` or `y` appears in the pairs returned by `func_1()`.
