Output State: **`ver` is the value that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, `graph[ver]` contains at least one element, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`, `q` now contains `node` at the end, `vis[node]` is 1.**

The code snippet sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1. All other initial conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the updated value of `vis[node]`.
