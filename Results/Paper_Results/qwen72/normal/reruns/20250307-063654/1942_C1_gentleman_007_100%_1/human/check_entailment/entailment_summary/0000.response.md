### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, given that Bessie has already chosen \( x \) vertices and we can choose no more than \( y \) additional vertices (in this case, \( y = 0 \)).

The provided code snippet is the main logic for solving the problem. Let's break down the code and see if it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) (where \( y = 0 \)).
   - It then reads \( x \) distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to \( x - 2 \). This is because the minimum number of triangles that can be formed with \( x \) vertices in a polygon is \( x - 2 \).

3. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The code sorts the list of chosen vertices `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list to check for additional triangles:
     - If two consecutive vertices in the sorted list are exactly 2 apart, it increments `ans` by 1.
     - It also checks if the last vertex in the list is \( n - 1 \) and the first vertex is 1, or if the last vertex is \( n \) and the first vertex is 2. If either condition is true, it increments `ans` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The code prints the value of `ans`, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Initialization:**
  - `ans = x - 2` is a correct starting point because \( x \) vertices can form at least \( x - 2 \) triangles.

- **Sorting:**
  - Sorting the vertices is necessary to check for consecutive vertices that can form additional triangles.

- **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
  - The condition `if arr[i - 1] + 2 == arr[i]` checks if two consecutive vertices in the sorted list are exactly 2 apart, which means they can form a triangle with the vertex in between.
  - The conditions `if arr[x - 1] == n - 1 and arr[0] == 1` and `if arr[x - 1] == n and arr[0] == 2` check if the polygon can be wrapped around to form additional triangles using the first and last vertices in the list.

- **Output:**
  - The output is the value of `ans`, which is correctly calculated based on the conditions provided.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed given the constraints. The code handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement and correctly checks for additional triangles.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
