The function `func_19` accepts a sorted list `p` of distinct integers and an integer `x`. It returns the length of the list `p` if the last element of `p` is less than `x`. Otherwise, it returns the index `mid` of the smallest element in `p` that is greater than or equal to `x`. The function does not modify the input list `p`.
