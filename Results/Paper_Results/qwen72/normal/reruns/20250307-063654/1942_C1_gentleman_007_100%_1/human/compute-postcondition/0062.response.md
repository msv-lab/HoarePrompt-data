Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are lists of integers or characters, and both are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `len(b) + 1` elements, and each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements from `dp[1][1]` to `dp[len(a)][len(b)]`. `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `j` is either `len(b)` or `len(b) - 1`. `l` is an empty list if `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, otherwise `l` contains the last element of `a`. Additionally, `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`.***
