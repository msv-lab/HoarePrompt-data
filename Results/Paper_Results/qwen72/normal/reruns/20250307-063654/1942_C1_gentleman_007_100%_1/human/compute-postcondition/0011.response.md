The only objects in the loop head are `node` and `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `graph[ver]`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `graph[ver]` that hasn't been processed yet. At the end of the last iteration, `node` was the first element in `graph[ver]`, and `graph[ver]` must be non-empty. After the last iteration, `node` has been processed, so the next `node` will be the second element in `graph[ver]`.

State: **`ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` is a deque with the front element removed, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least 2 elements, `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`, and `vis[ver]` is 1. If `vis[node]` is 0, `node` is appended to the end of `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1.**
