Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers or characters, and both are non-empty. `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `len(b) + 1` elements, and each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements from `dp[1][1]` to `dp[len(a)][len(b)]`. `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. `l` contains the elements of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in reverse order. `s` is a string containing the elements of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in the correct order.**
