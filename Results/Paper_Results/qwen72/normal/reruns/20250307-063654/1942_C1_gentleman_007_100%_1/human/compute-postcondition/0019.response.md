Output State: **`ver` is the value that was at the front of the deque `q` before the loop started, `q` is a deque with the front element removed and possibly additional elements appended, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` has been fully processed, and `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `ver` retains the value it had when the loop started, which was the first element in the deque `q`.
- The deque `q` has had its front element removed (which was `ver`), and any neighbors of `ver` that were not already visited have been appended to the end of `q`.
- The `graph` dictionary or list of lists remains unchanged, but all the neighbors of `ver` (i.e., `graph[ver]`) have been processed.
- The `vis` list has been updated to mark `ver` and all its neighbors as visited (i.e., `vis[ver]` and `vis[node]` for all `node` in `graph[ver]` are set to 1).
