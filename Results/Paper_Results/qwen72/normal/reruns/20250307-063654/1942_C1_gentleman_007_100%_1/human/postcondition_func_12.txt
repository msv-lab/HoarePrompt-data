The function `func_13` accepts a positive integer `n` such that 4 <= n <= 10^9 and returns a dictionary containing the prime factorization of `n`. The dictionary keys are the prime factors, and the values are the corresponding exponents indicating the number of times each prime factor divides `n`. If `n` is 1, the function returns an empty dictionary. After the function concludes, `n` is reduced to 1, and the dictionary `d` contains the complete prime factorization of the initial `n`.
