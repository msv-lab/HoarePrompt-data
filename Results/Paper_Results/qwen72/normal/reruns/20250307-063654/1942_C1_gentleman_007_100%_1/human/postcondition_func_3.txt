The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`. It returns a list of `n` inner lists, where each inner list contains `m` copies of the value `v`. The parameters `n` and `m` are non-negative integers, and `v` can be of any type. After the function concludes, the program state includes a new list of lists as specified, and the original parameters `n`, `m`, and `v` remain unchanged.
