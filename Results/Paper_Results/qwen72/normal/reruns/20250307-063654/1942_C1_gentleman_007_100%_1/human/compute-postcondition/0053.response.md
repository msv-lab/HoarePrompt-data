Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `q` will contain all unvisited nodes from `graph[ver]` appended to the back, and `vis` will be updated to mark all these nodes as visited (1). The value of `ver` will be the next element that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, and the loop will have processed all elements in `graph[ver]` that were not already visited.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The deque `q` will have all the unvisited nodes from the adjacency list `graph[ver]` appended to its back.
- The list `vis` will have been updated to mark all these new nodes as visited (i.e., their corresponding indices will be set to 1).
- The variable `ver` will hold the value of the next element that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, which will be the next node to be processed in the next iteration of the broader context (e.g., a BFS loop).
- The loop will have processed all elements in `graph[ver]` that were not already visited, ensuring that all reachable nodes from `ver` are added to `q` and marked as visited in `vis`.
