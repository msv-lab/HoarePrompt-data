The only objects in the loop head are `node` and `graph[ver]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `graph[ver]`. If `graph[ver]` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ver` is the value that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, `graph[ver]` contains at least one element, and `node` is the second element in `graph[ver]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more element, and `node` will be the next element in `graph[ver]` (which is the third element in this case).

State: **`ver` is the value that was at the front of `q` before the `popleft()` operation, `graph[ver]` contains at least two elements, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`**
