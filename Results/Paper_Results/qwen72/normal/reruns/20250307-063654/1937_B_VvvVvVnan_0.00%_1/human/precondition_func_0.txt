The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the dimensions of the grid `n`, and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, top_row, bottom_row):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the width of the grid (2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5), `top_row` and `bottom_row` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
