The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. Since the initial state does not specify that we are inside a loop, the `continue` statement would result in an error if executed in this context. However, assuming we are inside a loop, the `continue` statement would simply cause the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next one without changing any variables.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`, `x` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a cumulative XOR value from `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears in `x`, `i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If `upper` > `lower`, the condition `upper` > `lower` holds. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.**
