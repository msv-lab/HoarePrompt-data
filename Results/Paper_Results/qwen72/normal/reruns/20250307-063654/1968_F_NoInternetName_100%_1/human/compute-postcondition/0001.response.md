Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers for each query such that 1 <= l < r <= n. `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(func_1(int))` updates the list `a` by applying the function `func_1` to each element of `a` and converting the result to an integer.
- The length of `a` remains `n`, and each element `a_i` is still within the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30, but the values of the elements are now the result of `func_1` applied to the original elements and converted to integers.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
