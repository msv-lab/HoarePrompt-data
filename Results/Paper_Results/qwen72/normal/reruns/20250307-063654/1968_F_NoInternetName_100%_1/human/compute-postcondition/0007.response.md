Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`, `x` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 0 ^ i, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists, `inds[0]` now contains the list `[0, 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends the value `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`.
- `x[-1]` is the last element of `x`, which is `0 ^ i`.
- `len(x)` is 2, so `len(x) - 1` is 1.
- Therefore, `inds[0 ^ i]` is updated to include the value 1.
- Since `inds[0]` already contains `[0]`, after the code execution, `inds[0]` will be `[0, 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
