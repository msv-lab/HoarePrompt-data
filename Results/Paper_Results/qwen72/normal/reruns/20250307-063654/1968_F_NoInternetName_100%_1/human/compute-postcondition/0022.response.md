Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`, `x` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a cumulative XOR value from `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears in `x`, `i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.**
