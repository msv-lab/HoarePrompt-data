Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` and `q` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
2. `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
3. `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`.
4. `x` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
5. `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a cumulative XOR value from `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears in `x`.
6. `i` is 2.
7. `q` must be greater than 2.
8. `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
9. `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists.
10. `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
11. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the condition `upper` > `lower` holds. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.
12. `upper` is now the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides a detailed setup of the variables and objects, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or objects. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**

### Explanation:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper`. The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the output of the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'Yes'`.
