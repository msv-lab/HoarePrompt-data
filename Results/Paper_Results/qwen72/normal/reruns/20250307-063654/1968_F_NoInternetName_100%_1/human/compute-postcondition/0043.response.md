Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`, `x` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a cumulative XOR value from `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears in `x`, `i` is 2, `q` must be greater than 2, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the condition `upper` > `lower` holds and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.**

Explanation:
- The code `lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]` updates the value of `lower`.
- `inds[x[r]]` is a list of indices where the cumulative XOR value `x[r]` appears in `x`.
- `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` finds the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`.
- If no such index exists, `func_4` returns `None`, and the expression `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0` evaluates to `0`.
- Therefore, `lower` is assigned the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `0` if no such index exists.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, `r`, and `upper` remain unchanged.
