To determine what will be printed when the `print('Yes')` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `q` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`.

2. **Cumulative XOR Calculation:**
   - `x` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point. This means:
     - `x[0]` is 0 (the initial cumulative XOR).
     - `x[1]` is `a[0]`.
     - `x[2]` is `a[0] ^ a[1]`.
     - `x[3]` is `a[0] ^ a[1] ^ a[2]`.
     - And so on, up to `x[n]` which is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a`.

3. **Dictionary of Indices:**
   - `inds` is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key is a cumulative XOR value from `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears in `x`.

4. **Loop and Conditions:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `q` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists.
   - `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - `upper` is greater than `lower`.

Given these conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement will always execute if the conditions are met. The conditions are:

- `q` is greater than 0.
- `upper` is greater than `lower`.

Since the problem states that `upper` is greater than `lower`, the `print('Yes')` statement will be executed.

Output: **Yes**
