Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. **`n` and `q`**: These are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
2. **`a`**: This is a list of integers of length `n` where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\). After some processing, `a` is converted using `func_1` and `int`.
3. **`x`**: This is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
4. **`inds`**: This is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a cumulative XOR value from `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears in `x`.
5. **`i`**: This is set to 2.
6. **`q`**: It must be greater than 2.
7. **`l` and `r`**: These are new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
8. **`lower`**: This is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists.
9. **`upper`**: This is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the condition `upper` > `lower` holds and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'No'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement itself.
- The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the string `'No'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'No'`, regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **No**
