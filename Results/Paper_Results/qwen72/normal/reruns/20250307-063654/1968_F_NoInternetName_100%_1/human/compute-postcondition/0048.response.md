Output State: **`i` is `q - 1`, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)` in the last iteration, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If `upper` > `lower`, the condition `upper` > `lower` holds. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop has completed all `q` iterations.
- The variable `i` is now `q - 1`, indicating that the loop has run from `0` to `q - 1` (inclusive).
- The variable `q` remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5.
- The variables `l` and `r` hold the values returned by `func_1(int)` in the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `lower` is the first index in the list `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or 0 if no such index exists.
- The variable `upper` is the last index in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
- If `upper` is greater than `lower`, the condition `upper` > `lower` holds, and the loop would have printed 'Yes' for this iteration. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`, and the loop would have printed 'No' for this iteration.
