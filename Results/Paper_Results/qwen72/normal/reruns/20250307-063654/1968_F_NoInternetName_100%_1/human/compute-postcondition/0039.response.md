Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`, `x` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a cumulative XOR value from `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears in `x`, `i` is 2, `q` must be greater than 2, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the condition `upper` > `lower` holds. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`. `upper` is now the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `l, r = func_1(int)` updates the values of `l` and `r` to the new values returned by the function `func_1(int)`.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `lower` and `upper` are still valid based on the new values of `l` and `r`.
- The relationship between `x[l - 1]` and `x[r]` and the conditions for `upper` and `lower` remain as described in the initial state.
