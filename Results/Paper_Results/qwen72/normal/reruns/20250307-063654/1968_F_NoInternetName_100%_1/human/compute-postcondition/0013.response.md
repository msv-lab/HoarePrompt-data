Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`, `x` is a list containing four elements: 0, 0 ^ i, (0 ^ i) ^ i, and ((0 ^ i) ^ i) ^ i, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists, `inds[0]` now contains the list `[0, 1]`, `inds[(0 ^ i) ^ i]` now contains the list `[2]`, `inds[((0 ^ i) ^ i) ^ i]` now contains the list `[3]`, `i` is `a[2]`.**
