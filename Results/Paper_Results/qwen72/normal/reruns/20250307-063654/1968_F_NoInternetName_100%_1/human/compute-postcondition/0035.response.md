Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`n` and `q` are integers**: 
   - \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
   - \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
2. **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`**:
   - \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\)
3. **`a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`**:
   - This means each element in `a` has been transformed by `func_1` and then converted to an integer.
4. **`x` is a list containing `n + 1` elements**:
   - Each element in `x` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
5. **`inds` is a defaultdict of lists**:
   - Each key in `inds` is a cumulative XOR value from `x`.
   - The corresponding value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears in `x`.
6. **`i` is 1**:
   - This is a simple integer variable.
7. **`q` must be greater than 1**:
   - This is a condition that must hold.
8. **`l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`**:
   - These are integers derived from some function `func_1`.
9. **`lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists**:
   - This is the first index in the list of indices for the cumulative XOR value `x[r]` that is less than `l`.
   - If no such index exists, `lower` is 0.
10. **`upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`**:
    - This is the last index in the list of indices for the cumulative XOR value `x[l - 1]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
11. **If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the condition `upper` > `lower` holds. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`**:
    - If the cumulative XOR values at `l - 1` and `r` are the same, then `upper` is greater than `lower`.
    - If they are different, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.
12. **`upper` is now the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`**:
    - This reiterates the previous point about `upper`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
