The code snippet `n, q = func_1(int)` assigns new values to `n` and `q` based on the output of `func_1(int)`. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `q` after the assignment. However, we can infer that the new values of `n` and `q` will still satisfy the constraints given in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers for each query such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**
