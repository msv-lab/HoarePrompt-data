Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and processes the queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - It uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is interesting.
   - It first checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`. If true, the subarray is interesting because the XOR of the subarray is 0, which can be split into multiple parts with XOR 0.
   - If the above condition is not met, it uses binary search to find the indices in `inds` where the prefix XOR values match the required conditions.
   - If an appropriate index is found, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Binary Search Functions:**
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are used to perform binary search to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary.
   - `func_4` adjusts the result of `func_2` to account for 1-based indexing.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
