You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

    #The program returns a map object that applies the `cast` function to each element in the list of strings obtained by splitting the input. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of values, and `cast` will convert each value to the specified type (such as int or float).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `cast` and returns a map object that applies the `cast` function to each element in a list of strings obtained by splitting a space-separated input string. The input is expected to be provided by the user, and each value in the input string will be converted to the specified type (such as int or float) using the `cast` function.

If `upper` > `lower`, the condition `upper` > `lower` holds. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and answers `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` (1 <= l < r <= n). For each query, the function determines if there exists a subarray within `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` whose cumulative XOR is zero. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the state by printing the results of the queries. After the function concludes, `n` and `q` remain integers within their original constraints, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, and `x` and `inds` are internal data structures used for query processing.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has an array `a` and a set of queries.
   - Each query specifies a subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` and asks if this subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts such that the XOR of each part is the same.

2. **Output:**
   - For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting, otherwise "NO".

### Program Analysis
#### Function 1: `func_1(cast)`
- This function reads input, splits it, and maps the `cast` function to each element.
- It is used to read integers from input lines.

#### Function 2: `func_2(arr, predicate)`
- This function performs a binary search on `arr` to find the largest index `mid` such that `predicate(arr[mid])` is true.
- It returns the index if found, otherwise `None`.

#### Function 3: `func_3(arr, predicate)`
- This function is a direct call to `func_2(arr, predicate)`.
- It is redundant and can be removed without affecting the program's functionality.

#### Function 4: `func_4(arr, predicate)`
- This function calls `func_2(arr, predicate)` and adds 1 to the result if it is not `None`.
- It is used to find the largest index `mid` such that `predicate(arr[mid])` is true and then return `mid + 1`.

#### Function 5: `func_5()`
- This function processes each test case.
- It reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
- It reads the array `a`.
- It initializes a prefix XOR array `x` and a dictionary `inds` to store indices of each prefix XOR value.
- For each element in `a`, it updates the prefix XOR array `x` and the dictionary `inds`.
- For each query, it checks if the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is interesting:
  - If `x[l-1]` equals `x[r]`, it prints "Yes" because the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR.
  - Otherwise, it uses binary search to find the largest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the largest index in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
  - If the index in `inds[x[l-1]]` is greater than the index in `inds[x[r]]`, it prints "Yes".
  - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness Check
1. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is correctly computed. Each element `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` as `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

2. **Dictionary `inds`:**
   - The dictionary `inds` correctly stores the indices of each prefix XOR value.
   - This helps in efficiently checking if there are multiple segments with the same XOR value.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The program correctly checks if `x[l-1]` equals `x[r]` to determine if the subarray can be split into two parts with the same XOR.
   - If `x[l-1]` does not equal `x[r]`, it uses binary search to find the largest indices in `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l-1]]` that satisfy the conditions.
   - The logic for comparing these indices to determine if the subarray is interesting is correct.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. It efficiently uses prefix XOR and binary search to handle the queries.

Correctness: **True**
