The function `func_5` processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and answers `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` (1 <= l < r <= n). For each query, the function determines if there exists a subarray within `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` whose cumulative XOR is zero. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the state by printing the results of the queries. After the function concludes, `n` and `q` remain integers within their original constraints, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, and `x` and `inds` are internal data structures used for query processing.
