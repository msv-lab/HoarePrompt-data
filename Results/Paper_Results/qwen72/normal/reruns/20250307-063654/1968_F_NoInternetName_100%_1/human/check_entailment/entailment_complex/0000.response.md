### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. It is used to read the number of test cases and the array elements.
   - The function is correct and essential for parsing the input.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function performs a binary search on the list `arr` to find the largest index `l` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is true.
   - The function is correct and is used to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function is a wrapper around `func_2` and is used to find the largest index `l` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is true.
   - The function is correct but redundant since it just calls `func_2` without any additional logic.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function is another wrapper around `func_2` but returns the result of `func_2` incremented by 1 if the result is not `None`.
   - The function is correct and is used to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - This function processes the main logic of the problem. It reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q` for each test case.
   - It then reads the array `a` and computes the cumulative XOR values in the list `x`.
   - It also builds a dictionary `inds` where each key is a cumulative XOR value and the value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray from `a[l-1]` to `a[r-1]` is interesting by comparing the cumulative XOR values at `x[l-1]` and `x[r]`.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the subarray from `l` to `r` has a cumulative XOR of zero, which is interesting.
   - Otherwise, it uses `func_4` and `func_3` to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary to determine if there is a subarray with a cumulative XOR of zero.
   - The function correctly prints "Yes" if the subarray is interesting and "No" otherwise.

### Overall Correctness:
The program is designed to solve the problem correctly. It reads the input, processes the cumulative XOR values, and uses binary search to efficiently answer the queries. The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is implemented correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
