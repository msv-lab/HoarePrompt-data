Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`, `x` is a list containing three elements, 0, 0 ^ i, and (0 ^ i) ^ i, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists, `inds[0]` now contains the list `[0, 1]`, `i` is `a[1]`**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the list `x`. The new element is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, where `x[-1]` is the last element of `x` and `i` is `a[1]`.
- Initially, `x` contains two elements: 0 and `0 ^ i` (which is `i` since `0 ^ i` equals `i`).
- The new element appended to `x` is `(0 ^ i) ^ i`, which simplifies to `i ^ i` and results in 0 (since any integer XORed with itself is 0).
- Therefore, `x` now contains three elements: 0, `i`, and 0.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
