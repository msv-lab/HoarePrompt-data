The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `cast` and returns a map object that applies the `cast` function to each element in a list of strings obtained by splitting a space-separated input string. The input is expected to be provided by the user, and each value in the input string will be converted to the specified type (such as int or float) using the `cast` function.
