Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `q` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`.
   - `x` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a cumulative XOR value from `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears in `x`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists.
   - `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the condition `upper` > `lower` holds. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.
   - `upper` is now the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('No')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'No'`.
   - The initial state and the variables described do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, or `upper`.

Output: **No**
