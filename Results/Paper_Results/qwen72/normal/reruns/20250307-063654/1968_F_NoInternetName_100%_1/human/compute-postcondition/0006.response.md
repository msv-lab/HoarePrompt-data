Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`, `x` is a list containing two elements, 0 and 0 ^ i, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists, and `inds[0]` now contains the list `[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` (which is 0) and `i` to the list `x`.
- The initial state specifies that `x` is a list containing a single element, 0. After the code is executed, `x` will contain two elements: 0 and the result of `0 ^ i`.
- The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so the exact value of the second element in `x` depends on `i`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
