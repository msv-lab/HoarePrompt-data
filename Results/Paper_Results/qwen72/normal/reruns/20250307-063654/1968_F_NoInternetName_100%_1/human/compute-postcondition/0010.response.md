Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`, `x` is a list containing three elements, 0, 0 ^ i, and (0 ^ i) ^ i, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists, `inds[0]` now contains the list `[0, 1]`, `inds[(0 ^ i) ^ i]` now contains the list `[2]`, `i` is `a[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends the value `2` (which is `len(x) - 1`) to the list `inds[(0 ^ i) ^ i]`.
- Since `x` contains the elements `[0, 0 ^ i, (0 ^ i) ^ i]`, `x[-1]` is `(0 ^ i) ^ i`.
- The value `(0 ^ i) ^ i` simplifies to `0` because `0 ^ i` is `i` and `i ^ i` is `0`.
- Therefore, `inds[0]` is updated to include the value `2`, making it `[0, 1, 2]`.
- However, the initial state already mentions that `inds[0]` contains `[0, 1]`, so the correct update is that `inds[(0 ^ i) ^ i]` now contains `[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
