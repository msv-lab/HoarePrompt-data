Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `a` is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`, `x` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a cumulative XOR value from `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears in `x`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variables `n` and `q` remain unchanged, with `n` being the length of the list `a` and `q` being the number of queries.
- The list `a` remains a list of integers of length `n`, each converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`.
- The list `x` now contains `n + 1` elements. The first element is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- The `inds` dictionary now maps each cumulative XOR value from `x` to a list of indices where this value appears in `x`. For example, `inds[0]` will contain the indices where the cumulative XOR is 0, and `inds[some_value]` will contain the indices where the cumulative XOR is `some_value`.
