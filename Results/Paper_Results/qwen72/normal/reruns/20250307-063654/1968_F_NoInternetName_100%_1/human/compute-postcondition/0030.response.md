Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`n` and `q`** are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
2. **`a`** is a list of integers of length `n` where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
3. **`a`** is now a list of integers converted from the original `a` using `func_1` and `int`.
4. **`x`** is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
5. **`inds`** is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a cumulative XOR value from `x` and the corresponding value is a list of indices where this cumulative XOR value appears in `x`.
6. **`i`** is 1.
7. **`q`** must be greater than 1.
8. **`l` and `r`** are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
9. **`lower`** is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or 0 if no such index exists.
10. **`upper`** is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
11. If **`upper`** > **`lower`**, the condition `upper` > `lower` holds. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or objects directly.
- The condition described in the initial state (`upper` > `lower`) is not checked in the code snippet. The `print` statement will always execute and print `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `upper` and `lower`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
