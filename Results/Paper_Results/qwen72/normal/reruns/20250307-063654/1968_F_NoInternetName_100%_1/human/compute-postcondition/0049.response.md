The function `func_5` accepts parameters `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, and `r`. `n` and `q` are integers with the constraints 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30. For each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.

The function processes these inputs and returns the result of each query. Each query is defined by a pair of integers `l` and `r`, and the function returns a specific value based on the elements of the list `a` between indices `l` and `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n` and `q`, a list of integers `a` of length `n`, and for each query, integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= l < r <= n. It returns a result for each query based on the elements of the list `a` between the indices `l` and `r`.**
