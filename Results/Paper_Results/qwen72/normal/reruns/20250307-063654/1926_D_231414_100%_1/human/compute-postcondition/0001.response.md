Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `times` is an input integer. `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The variable `check` is assigned the value `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is 2147483647. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `times`) remain unchanged.
