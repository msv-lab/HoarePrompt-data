To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to evaluate the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` with the given initial state. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - `size` is 1.
   - `number` is not equal to 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\).

3. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   - Substitute `size` with 1: \((1 << (1 + 1)) - 1\).
   - Simplify the expression: \((1 << 2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\).
   - The condition becomes \(3 \leq \text{number}\).

4. **Check the Initial State**:
   - `number` is already given to be in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
   - Since \(3 \leq \text{number}\) is a subset of \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), the condition \(3 \leq \text{number}\) is satisfied by the initial state.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - No adjustments are needed to the initial state because the loop condition is already satisfied.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), `size` is 1, and `number` is not equal to 0.**
