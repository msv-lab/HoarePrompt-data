### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating an array of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in the array is exactly equal to a given integer \( X \), where \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \).
   - The array should have a length of at most 200, and all elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - It then prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will result in exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - It starts by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( X - 1 \) (i.e., \( 2^k \le X - 1 \)).
   - It then appends the integers from 0 to \( k-1 \) to the sequence.
   - It recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences needed, which is \( X - 2^k \).
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the sequence to ensure the increasing subsequences count is correct by adding the result of the recursive call to the last \( k \) elements.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach leverages the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence of length \( n \) can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the largest power of 2 that fits into the remaining number of subsequences and appends the corresponding elements to the sequence.
   - The recursive call ensures that the remaining number of subsequences is handled, and the sequence is modified to maintain the correct count of increasing subsequences.
   - The modification step ensures that the elements added in the recursive call do not interfere with the increasing nature of the subsequences.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( X = 2 \) by generating a sequence of length 1 with a single element.
   - For larger values of \( X \), the program generates a sequence that is guaranteed to have the correct number of increasing subsequences by the recursive construction.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, which matches the required output format.
   - The sequence generated is within the specified length and element range.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial Sequence Construction**:
  - The function `func_1` starts by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( X - 1 \). This is done using the loop `while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number: size += 1`.
  - It then appends integers from 0 to \( k-1 \) to the sequence, where \( k \) is the size determined in the previous step.

- **Recursive Call**:
  - The function makes a recursive call to `func_1` with the remaining number of subsequences needed, which is \( X - 2^k \).
  - The result of the recursive call is stored in `result`.

- **Sequence Modification**:
  - After the recursive call, the function modifies the last \( k \) elements of the sequence by adding `result` to each of them. This ensures that the elements added in the recursive call do not interfere with the increasing nature of the subsequences.
  - The assert statement `assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` ensures that the indices being modified are within the bounds of the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given range of \( X \). The recursive approach and the sequence construction logic are sound and handle the problem requirements effectively. The sequence generated is within the specified length and element range, and the program correctly handles edge cases.

Final: **True**
