Output State: **number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, sequence is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9], size is 1, and the size of the generated sequence is returned. Additionally, number is not equal to 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `size`, which is now set to 1. The other conditions and variables (`number`, `sequence`) remain as they were initially described.
