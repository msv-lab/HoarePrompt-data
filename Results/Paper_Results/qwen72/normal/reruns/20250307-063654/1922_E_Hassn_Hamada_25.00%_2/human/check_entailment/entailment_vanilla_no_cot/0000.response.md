Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem by generating an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is designed to recursively construct the array by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and the combinatorial nature of increasing subsequences. Here's a brief explanation of how the program works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n - 1` and an empty list `result`.
   - The function calculates the size of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number` and appends a sequence of integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `result` list.
   - It then recursively calls itself with the remaining part of the number (`number - (1 << size) + 1`).
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the last `result` elements of the list to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence.
   - It prints the sequence itself, which is constructed to have exactly X increasing subsequences.

The program's logic is sound and should work for the given constraints. The assertions in the code help ensure that the sequence is being modified correctly, and the recursive approach ensures that the sequence is built to meet the required number of increasing subsequences.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program should correctly generate the required array for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
