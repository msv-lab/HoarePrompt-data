The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `size`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
- `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200 + `size`, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1.
- `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
- `sequence[-result - 1]` is updated to `sequence[-result - 1] + result`.
- `sequence[-result - i - 1]` is updated to `sequence[-result - i - 1] + result`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `size` must remain the same. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is 2.
- `size` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200 + `size`, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence), `sequence[-result - 1]` is updated to `sequence[-result - 1] + result, `sequence[-result - i - 1]` is updated to `sequence[-result - i - 1] + result.**
