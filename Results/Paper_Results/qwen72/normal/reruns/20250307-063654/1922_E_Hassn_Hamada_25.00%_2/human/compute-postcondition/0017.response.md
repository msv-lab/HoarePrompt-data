Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 203, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last element is 2, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2.** 

The value of `i` (which is 2) is appended to the list `sequence`. The length of `sequence` is now at most 203, and its last element is 2. The values of `number`, `size`, and `i` remain unchanged.
