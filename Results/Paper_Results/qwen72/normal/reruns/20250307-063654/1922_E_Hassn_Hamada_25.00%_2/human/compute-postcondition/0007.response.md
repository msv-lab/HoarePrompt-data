The variables in the loop head are `number` and `size`. The condition for the loop to execute is \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\).

At the end of the last iteration:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\)
- `size` is 2
- `number` is not equal to 0

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to evaluate the condition with the current values:
- \((1 << (2 + 1)) - 1 = (1 << 3) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\)
- The condition is \(7 \leq \text{number}\)

Since `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\) and `number` is not equal to 0, it is possible that `number` is greater than or equal to 7. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one more time with the current state.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), `size` is 2, and `number` is not equal to 0**
