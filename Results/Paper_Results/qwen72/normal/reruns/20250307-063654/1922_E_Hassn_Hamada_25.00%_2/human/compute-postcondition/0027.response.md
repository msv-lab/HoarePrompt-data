Output State: **The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\), and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. The last `size` elements of `sequence` are updated by adding `result` to each of them.**
