### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - If it is impossible to find such an array, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate the required sequence and return its size.
   - It uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.

3. **Base Case**:
   - If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. This is correct because an empty sequence has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence itself).

4. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function calculates the smallest `size` such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\). This is equivalent to finding the smallest \( k \) such that \( 2^{k+1} - 1 > \text{number} \).
   - It then appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the sequence.
   - The function makes a recursive call with the updated `number` and `sequence`.
   - After the recursive call, it updates the last `size` elements of the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to each of them.

5. **Sequence Length and Element Range**:
   - The sequence length is managed by the recursive function, ensuring it does not exceed 200.
   - The elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) as they are initially set to integers from 0 to `size - 1` and then updated by adding the result of the recursive call.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the smallest `size` such that the number of increasing subsequences is greater than `number`.
   - The recursive call and the subsequent updates ensure that the sequence is built in a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches `number`.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case where `number` is 0.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by managing the `size` and the recursive calls.

8. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which is not possible given the constraints and the algorithm), it should print \(-1\). However, the algorithm is designed to always find a valid sequence, so this case is not expected.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. It correctly generates an array with the required number of increasing subsequences and handles the constraints appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
