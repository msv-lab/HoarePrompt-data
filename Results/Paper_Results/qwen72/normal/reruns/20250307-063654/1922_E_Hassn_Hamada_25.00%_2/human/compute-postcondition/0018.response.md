Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200 + `size`, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\), and `i` is `size` - 1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `number` remains within its initial range. The `sequence` list will have grown by `size` elements, and these new elements will be the integers from 0 to `size` - 1, appended to the original list. The `size` variable retains its initial value, which is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1\) is greater than `number`. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `size` - 1, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
