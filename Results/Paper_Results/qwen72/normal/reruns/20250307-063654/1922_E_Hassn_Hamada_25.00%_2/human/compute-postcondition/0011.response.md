Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\), and `number` is not equal to 0.**

In natural language, the loop will continue to increment `size` until \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1\) is greater than `number`. This means that `size` will be the smallest integer for which the condition \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) holds true. The `sequence` and `number` variables remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
