To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `size`. The loop will execute if `size` is greater than 0, and `i` will start from 0 and iterate up to `size - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\)
- `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200 + `size`, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1
- `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\)
- `i` is `size` - 1
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `i` should start from 0, and `size` should be greater than 0.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200 + `size`, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**
