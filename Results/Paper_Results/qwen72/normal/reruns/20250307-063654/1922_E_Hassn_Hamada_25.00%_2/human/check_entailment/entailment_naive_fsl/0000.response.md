Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where \( X = 2 \). According to the problem description, for \( X = 2 \), the array should have exactly 2 increasing subsequences. However, the program outputs an array of length 1 with a single element (e.g., `0`), which only has 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the single element itself).

For \( X = 2 \), a correct output could be an array of length 2, such as `[0, 1]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[0]` and `[0, 1]`.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for \( X = 2 \) and is therefore incorrect.
