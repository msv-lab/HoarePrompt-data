You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number` (an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18) and `sequence` (a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9]). The function returns 0 if `number` is 0. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > number, and `result` is the value returned by a recursive call to `func_1` with the parameters `number - (1 << size) + 1` and the modified `sequence`. The function appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence` and updates the last `size` elements of `sequence` by adding `result` to each of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating an array of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in the array is exactly equal to a given integer \( X \), where \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \).
   - The array should have a length of at most 200, and all elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - It then prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will result in exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - It starts by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( X - 1 \) (i.e., \( 2^k \le X - 1 \)).
   - It then appends the integers from 0 to \( k-1 \) to the sequence.
   - It recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences needed, which is \( X - 2^k \).
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the sequence to ensure the increasing subsequences count is correct.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach leverages the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence of length \( n \) can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the largest power of 2 that fits into the remaining number of subsequences and appends the corresponding elements to the sequence.
   - The recursive call ensures that the remaining number of subsequences is handled, and the sequence is modified to maintain the correct count of increasing subsequences.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( X = 2 \) by generating a sequence of length 1 with a single element.
   - For larger values of \( X \), the program generates a sequence that is guaranteed to have the correct number of increasing subsequences by the recursive construction.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, which matches the required output format.
   - The sequence generated is within the specified length and element range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given range of \( X \). The recursive approach and the sequence construction logic are sound and handle the problem requirements effectively.

Correctness: **True**
