Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 202, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last element is 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**. 

The code snippet `sequence.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the end of the `sequence` list. The length of `sequence` is now at most 202, and the last element is 1. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
