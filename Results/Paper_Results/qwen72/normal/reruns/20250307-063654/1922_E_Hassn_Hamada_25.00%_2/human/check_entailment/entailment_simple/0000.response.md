### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to construct an array of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array where the elements are in strictly increasing order and the indices are in increasing order.
   - If no such array exists, the program should output \(-1\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and initializes an empty list `result`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with \( n - 1 \) and `result` as arguments.
   - After `func_1` returns, it prints the length of `result` and the elements of `result`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will have a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - It first checks if `number` is 0. If so, it returns 0, indicating that the sequence is complete.
   - It then finds the smallest `size` such that \( (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number} \). This is equivalent to finding the smallest \( k \) such that \( 2^{k+1} - 1 > \text{number} \).
   - It appends the integers from 0 to `size` - 1 to `sequence`.
   - It recursively calls `func_1` with \( \text{number} - (1 << \text{size}) + 1 \) and the updated `sequence`.
   - After the recursive call, it updates the last `size` elements of `sequence` by adding the result of the recursive call to each of them.
   - Finally, it returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Base Case**: When `number` is 0, the function returns 0, which is correct because an empty sequence has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).
   - **Recursive Case**: The function finds the smallest `size` such that \( 2^{size+1} - 1 > \text{number} \). This ensures that the sequence generated will have at least \( 2^{\text{size}} \) increasing subsequences.
   - **Sequence Construction**: The function appends the integers from 0 to `size` - 1 to `sequence`, which ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing up to this point.
   - **Recursive Call**: The function then recursively calls itself with the remaining number of increasing subsequences needed, which is \( \text{number} - (1 << \text{size}) + 1 \).
   - **Updating Elements**: The function updates the last `size` elements of `sequence` by adding the result of the recursive call to each of them. This ensures that the new elements are greater than the previous elements, maintaining the strictly increasing property.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call, which correctly represents the total length of the sequence.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( X = 2 \) correctly by returning a sequence of length 1 (e.g., [0]).
   - The program handles larger values of \( X \) by constructing a sequence that meets the requirements.

6. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 and that the elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given constraints. The recursive approach and the sequence construction logic are sound and meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
