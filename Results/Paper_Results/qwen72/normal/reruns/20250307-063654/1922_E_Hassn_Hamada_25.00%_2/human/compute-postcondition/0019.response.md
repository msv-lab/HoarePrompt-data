Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200 + `size`, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\), `i` is `size` - 1, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `number` remains an integer within the specified range.
- The variable `sequence` remains a list of integers with the specified properties.
- The variable `size` remains the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\).
- The variable `i` remains `size` - 1.
- A new variable `result` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. The exact value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
