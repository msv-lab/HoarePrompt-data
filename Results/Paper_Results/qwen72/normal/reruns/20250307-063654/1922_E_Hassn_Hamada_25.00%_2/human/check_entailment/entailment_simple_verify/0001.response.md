### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating an array of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in the array is exactly equal to a given integer \( X \), where \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \).
   - The array should have a length of at most 200, and all elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - It then prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will result in exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - It starts by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( X - 1 \) (i.e., \( 2^k \le X - 1 \)).
   - It then appends the integers from 0 to \( k-1 \) to the sequence.
   - It recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences needed, which is \( X - 2^k \).
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the sequence to ensure the increasing subsequences count is correct.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach leverages the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence of length \( n \) can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the largest power of 2 that fits into the remaining number of subsequences and appends the corresponding elements to the sequence.
   - The recursive call ensures that the remaining number of subsequences is handled, and the sequence is modified to maintain the correct count of increasing subsequences.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( X = 2 \) by generating a sequence of length 1 with a single element.
   - For larger values of \( X \), the program generates a sequence that is guaranteed to have the correct number of increasing subsequences by the recursive construction.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, which matches the required output format.
   - The sequence generated is within the specified length and element range.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**:
  - `number` is an integer such that \( 2 \le \text{number} \le 10^{18} \).
  - `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

- **Base Case**:
  - If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. This is correct because an empty sequence has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence itself).

- **Finding the Largest Power of 2**:
  - The loop `while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:` finds the smallest `size` such that \( (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number} \). This is equivalent to finding the largest \( k \) such that \( 2^k \le \text{number} \).
  - This step is correct and ensures that the largest possible power of 2 is used to generate the sequence.

- **Appending Elements**:
  - The loop `for i in range(size): sequence.append(i)` appends the integers from 0 to \( size - 1 \) to the sequence. This is correct and ensures that the sequence has the initial elements needed to form the increasing subsequences.

- **Recursive Call**:
  - The function recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1`. This is correct because it reduces the problem to finding the remaining number of increasing subsequences needed.
  - The recursive call returns the size of the generated sequence, which is stored in `result`.

- **Modifying the Sequence**:
  - The loop `for i in range(size): sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` modifies the last `size` elements of the sequence by adding `result` to each of them. This step ensures that the sequence maintains the correct number of increasing subsequences.
  - The assertion `assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` ensures that the indices used for modification are valid.

- **Return Value**:
  - The function returns `size + result`, which is the total size of the sequence after the recursive call and modifications. This is correct and ensures that the sequence length is accurately reported.

### Final Evaluation:

The program correctly generates an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given range of \( X \). The recursive approach and the sequence construction logic are sound and handle the problem requirements effectively. The annotated code confirms that the program maintains the correct state and behavior at each step.

Final: **True**
