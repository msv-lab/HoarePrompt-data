### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating an array of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in the array is exactly equal to a given integer \( X \), where \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \).
   - The array should have a length of at most 200, and all elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - It then prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will result in exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - It starts by finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( X - 1 \) (i.e., \( 2^k \le X - 1 \)).
   - It then appends the integers from 0 to \( k-1 \) to the sequence.
   - It recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences needed, which is \( X - 2^k \).
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the sequence to ensure the increasing subsequences count is correct.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach leverages the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence of length \( n \) can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the largest power of 2 that fits into the remaining number of subsequences and appends the corresponding elements to the sequence.
   - The recursive call ensures that the remaining number of subsequences is handled, and the sequence is modified to maintain the correct count of increasing subsequences.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( X = 2 \) by generating a sequence of length 1 with a single element.
   - For larger values of \( X \), the program generates a sequence that is guaranteed to have the correct number of increasing subsequences by the recursive construction.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, which matches the required output format.
   - The sequence generated is within the specified length and element range.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**:
  - `number` is an integer such that \( 2 \le \text{number} \le 10^{18} \).
  - `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

- **Base Case**:
  - If `number` is 0, the function returns 0, which is correct because an array with no elements has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).

- **Recursive Case**:
  - The function finds the smallest `size` such that \( (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number} \). This is equivalent to finding the largest \( k \) such that \( 2^k \le \text{number} \).
  - It appends the integers from 0 to \( k-1 \) to the sequence. This ensures that the sequence has \( 2^k \) increasing subsequences.
  - It recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences needed, which is \( \text{number} - (1 << size) + 1 \).
  - After the recursive call, it modifies the sequence by adding `result` to the last `size` elements. This ensures that the sequence maintains the correct number of increasing subsequences.

- **Assertions**:
  - The assertions in the code ensure that the indices used for modifying the sequence are valid. This is crucial for maintaining the correctness of the sequence.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic and the recursive approach are sound. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the largest power of 2 that fits into the remaining number of subsequences and appends the corresponding elements to the sequence. The recursive call ensures that the remaining number of subsequences is handled, and the sequence is modified to maintain the correct count of increasing subsequences. The program also handles edge cases and prints the output in the required format.
