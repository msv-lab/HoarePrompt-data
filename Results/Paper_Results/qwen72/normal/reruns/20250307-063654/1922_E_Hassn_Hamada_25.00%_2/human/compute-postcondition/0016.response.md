The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `size`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `size`. Therefore, `size` must be greater than 2.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 202, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last element is 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
