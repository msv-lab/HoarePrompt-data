Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200 + `size`, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0, `i` is `size` - 1, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence), and for each `j` from 0 to `size` - 1, `sequence[-result - j - 1]` is updated to `sequence[-result - j - 1] + result.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `number` and `size` variables remain unchanged from their initial values. The `sequence` list is still a list of integers with the same length constraints and element range as initially, but the last `size` elements of the list have been modified. Specifically, for each index `j` from 0 to `size` - 1, the element at the position `sequence[-result - j - 1]` has been incremented by the value of `result`. The variable `i` is now equal to `size` - 1, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
