Reasoning:  
The problem requires generating an array of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is designed to construct such an array by recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

1. **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, the function returns 0, indicating that no elements need to be added to the sequence. This is correct because an empty subsequence is considered increasing.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function calculates the smallest `size` such that \( (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \) is greater than `number`. This is done to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It then appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`. This step ensures that the sequence has a certain number of elements that can form increasing subsequences.
   - The function makes a recursive call to `func_1` with the updated `number` and `sequence`. The updated `number` is `number - (1 << size) + 1`, which effectively reduces the problem size.
   - After the recursive call, the function updates the last `size` elements of the `sequence` by adding the result of the recursive call to each of them. This step ensures that the elements in the sequence are distinct and can form the required number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which should not happen given the constraints and the logic of the function), the program would print -1. However, the function `func_1` is designed to always generate a valid sequence for the given constraints.

4. **Constraints**:
   - The sequence length is at most 200, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The elements of the sequence are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), which is also within the allowed range.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case correctly.
   - The recursive calls and updates ensure that the sequence is constructed in a way that meets the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
