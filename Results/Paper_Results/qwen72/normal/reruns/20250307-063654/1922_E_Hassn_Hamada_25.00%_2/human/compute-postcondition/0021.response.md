Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200 + `size`, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence), `sequence[-result - 1]` is updated to `sequence[-result - 1] + result`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `number` remains unchanged.
- The value of `sequence` remains a list of integers with the same properties, but the element at the index `sequence[-result - 1]` is updated by adding `result` to it.
- The value of `size` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `result` remains the same as it was returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
- The specific element in `sequence` that is updated is `sequence[-result - 1]`, which is incremented by `result`.
