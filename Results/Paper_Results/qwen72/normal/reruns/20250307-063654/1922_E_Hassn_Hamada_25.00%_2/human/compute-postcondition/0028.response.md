Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number` and `sequence`. `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > number, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. Additionally, the last `size` elements of `sequence` are updated by adding `result` to each of them.**
