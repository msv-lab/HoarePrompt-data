The code snippet updates the value of `sequence[-result - i - 1]` by adding `result` to it. The initial state provides the context for the variables involved. Let's break down the impact of the code:

- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
- `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200 + `size`, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1.
- `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
- `sequence[-result - 1]` is updated to `sequence[-result - 1] + result`.
- `sequence[-result - i - 1]` is updated to `sequence[-result - i - 1] + result`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
```

This line of code updates the element at the index `-(result + i + 1)` in the `sequence` list by adding `result` to it. Since `i` is 2, the index being updated is `-(result + 2 + 1)`, which simplifies to `-(result + 3)`.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200 + `size`, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence), `sequence[-result - 1]` is updated to `sequence[-result - 1] + result, `sequence[-result - 3]` is updated to `sequence[-result - 3] + result.**
