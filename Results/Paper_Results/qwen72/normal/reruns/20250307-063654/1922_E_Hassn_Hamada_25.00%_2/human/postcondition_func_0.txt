The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number` (an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18) and `sequence` (a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9]). The function returns 0 if `number` is 0. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is the smallest integer such that (1 << (size + 1)) - 1 > number, and `result` is the value returned by a recursive call to `func_1` with the parameters `number - (1 << size) + 1` and the modified `sequence`. The function appends integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence` and updates the last `size` elements of `sequence` by adding `result` to each of them.
