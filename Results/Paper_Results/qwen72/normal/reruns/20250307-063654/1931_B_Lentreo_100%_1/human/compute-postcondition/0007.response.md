The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as it is the initial value for the range function.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers where the length of `nums` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` in `nums` is an integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. `n` is now equal to the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. `mean` is the integer value of `total // n`. `total % n` is equal to 0. `curr` is 0, `i` is 0.**
