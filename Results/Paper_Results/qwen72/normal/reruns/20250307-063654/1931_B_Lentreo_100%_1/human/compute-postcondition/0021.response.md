Output State: **The program returns 'YES'**. This means that after evaluating the conditions and performing the necessary calculations, the program confirms that the sum of all elements in `nums` minus `n * mean` is 0, and no point during the loop did `curr` become less than 0. Therefore, the program successfully returns the string 'YES'.
