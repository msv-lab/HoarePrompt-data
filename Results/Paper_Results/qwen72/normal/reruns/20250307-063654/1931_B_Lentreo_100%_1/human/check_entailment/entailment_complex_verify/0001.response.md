### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input Validation:**
     - The function calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. This check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
   - **Mean Calculation:**
     - The mean amount of water each container should have is calculated as `total // n`.
   - **Cumulative Difference Check:**
     - The function initializes `curr` to 0 and iterates through each container.
     - For each container, it updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
     - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it returns 'NO' because it means that the left containers do not have enough water to balance the right containers.
     - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

4. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the cumulative difference `curr` is non-negative throughout the iteration, which is a valid way to check if the operation can be performed without violating the `i < j` constraint.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - `n = 1`, `nums = [43]`
     - Mean = 43
     - `curr` remains 0 throughout the loop.
     - Output: 'YES' (Correct)
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - `n = 2`, `nums = [1, 3]`
     - Mean = 2
     - `curr` becomes -1 after the first container, which is negative.
     - Output: 'NO' (Correct)
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - `n = 5`, `nums = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`
     - Mean = 3
     - `curr` values: 1, 3, 1, 0, 0
     - Output: 'YES' (Correct)
   - **Test Case 4:**
     - `n = 3`, `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
     - Mean = 2
     - `curr` values: -1, -1, 0
     - Output: 'NO' (Correct)
   - **Test Case 5:**
     - `n = 7`, `nums = [4, 5, 5, 0, 6, 4, 4]`
     - Mean = 4
     - `curr` values: 0, 1, 2, -2, 0, 0, 0
     - Output: 'NO' (Correct)
   - **Test Case 6:**
     - `n = 7`, `nums = [6, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4]`
     - Mean = 4
     - `curr` values: 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2
     - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The cumulative difference check ensures that the operation constraints are respected, and the examples provided verify the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
