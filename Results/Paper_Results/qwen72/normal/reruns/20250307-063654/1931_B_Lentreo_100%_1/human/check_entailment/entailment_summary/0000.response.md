Reasoning:  
The provided program and the problem description have a slight mismatch in the operation described. The problem states that water can be poured from the i-th container to the j-th container where i < j, meaning water can only move from a left container to a right container. However, the program checks if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by ensuring that the cumulative difference from the mean does not become negative at any point. This approach is actually correct for the problem as stated, because if the cumulative difference from the mean becomes negative, it means that at some point, the total amount of water in the containers to the left of the current one is less than what is required to reach the mean, which is impossible to correct by pouring water only to the right.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the details for each test case.
2. **Sum and Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the total amount of water and the mean amount of water per container. Since the sum of water is guaranteed to be divisible by the number of containers, the mean will be an integer.
3. **Cumulative Difference Check**: The program iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative difference from the mean. If at any point this cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that the total amount of water in the containers to the left of the current one is less than the required amount to reach the mean, making it impossible to equalize the water levels using the allowed operations.
4. **Output**: The program outputs 'YES' if it is possible to equalize the water levels, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water only from left to right.

Correctness: **True**
