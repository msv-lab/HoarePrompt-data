Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of integers where the length of `nums` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` in `nums` is an integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in `nums` is `total`. The current value of `n` is equal to the length of `nums`. The current value of `total % n` is not 0.**
