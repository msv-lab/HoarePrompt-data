Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers where the length of `nums` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` in `nums` is an integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. `n` is now equal to the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. `mean` is the integer value of `total // n`. `total % n` is equal to 0. `curr` is now `nums[0] - mean`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `curr` is updated to `nums[0] - mean`.
- All other variables (`nums`, `n`, `total`, `mean`, `total % n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
