The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `nums` (which determines the value of `n`). According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is equal to the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers where the length of `nums` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` in `nums` is an integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. `n` is now equal to the length of `nums` and must be greater than 1. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. `mean` is the integer value of `total // n`. `total % n` is equal to 0. `curr` is now `nums[0] - mean`, `i` is 1, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.**
