Reasoning: 

The original assessment is incorrect in its conclusion that the program is incorrect. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input and Initial State**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if the total is divisible by `n`.
   - If the total is not divisible by `n`, it returns 'NO'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant but does not affect correctness.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference from the mean as it iterates through the containers.

3. **Cumulative Difference Check**:
   - The program iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO'. This is because if `curr` becomes negative, it means that the cumulative amount of water in the containers from the start up to the current index is less than the required cumulative mean, which implies that it is impossible to balance the water by only pouring from a lower-index container to a higher-index container.

4. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to balance the water.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example input provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     1
     4
     1 3 2 4
     ```
   - The mean amount of water is `(1 + 3 + 2 + 4) // 4 = 2.5`, but since the problem guarantees that the sum is divisible by `n`, this example is invalid. The correct mean should be an integer.
   - For a valid example, consider:
     ```
     1
     4
     1 3 2 3
     ```
   - The mean amount of water is `(1 + 3 + 2 + 3) // 4 = 2`.
   - The program will iterate through the containers:
     - `i = 0`: `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` (negative, return 'NO')
     - The program correctly identifies that it is impossible to balance the water with the given constraints.

6. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic of the program is correct because it ensures that at no point does the cumulative difference from the mean become negative. This is a necessary and sufficient condition to determine if the water can be balanced by only pouring from a lower-index container to a higher-index container.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct and the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
