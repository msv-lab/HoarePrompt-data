You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` and checks if it is possible to make all elements in the list equal by performing a series of operations where each element can be increased or decreased by 1. The function returns 'NO' if at any point during the process, the current cumulative difference from the mean becomes negative, indicating that it is not possible to achieve the goal. If the function completes the iteration without encountering a negative cumulative difference, it returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all elements equal.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, but the distribution of water cannot be made equal by pouring water only from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```
The average amount of water is `(1 + 3 + 2 + 4) // 4 = 2.5`, which is not an integer, but the program checks for divisibility by `n` and proceeds to the next step. However, the problem description guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so the average should always be an integer. The issue is in the logic of the `func_1` function, which incorrectly returns 'NO' if at any point `curr` becomes negative. This logic fails to account for the possibility that water can be poured from a higher-index container to a lower-index container in a subsequent step to balance the distribution.

A correct approach would involve checking if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed across all containers, and then ensuring that the operation constraints (i.e., pouring from a lower-index container to a higher-index container) can be met to achieve this distribution. The current program does not correctly handle this, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
