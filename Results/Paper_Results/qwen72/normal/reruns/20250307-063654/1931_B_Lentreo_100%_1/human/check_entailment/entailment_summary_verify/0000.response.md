### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from a lower-index container to a higher-index container.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is guaranteed to be divisible by the number of containers, `n`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function first checks if the total sum of the water in the containers is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant.
   - The function calculates the mean amount of water each container should have, `mean = total // n`.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr` from the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, the function returns 'NO'. This is because a negative `curr` indicates that more water has been poured out than has been poured in, which means it's impossible to balance the water distribution using the allowed operations.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic of the function is correct. If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means that the cumulative water deficit (i.e., the total amount of water that needs to be poured in) exceeds the cumulative water surplus (i.e., the total amount of water that can be poured out). This is a valid condition to return 'NO'.
   - The function correctly identifies that if `curr` remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it is possible to balance the water distribution by pouring water from lower-index containers to higher-index containers.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     1 3 2 4
     ```
     - The mean is `(1 + 3 + 2 + 4) // 4 = 2.5`, which is not an integer. However, the problem guarantees that the sum is divisible by `n`, so this example is invalid.
   - For a valid example:
     ```
     1
     4
     1 3 3 3
     ```
     - The mean is `(1 + 3 + 3 + 3) // 4 = 2.5`, which is not an integer, but the problem guarantees it should be. Let's assume a valid input:
     ```
     1
     4
