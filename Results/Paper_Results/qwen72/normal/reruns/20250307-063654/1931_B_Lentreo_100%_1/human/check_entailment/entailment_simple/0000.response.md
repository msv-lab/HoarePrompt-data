### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the list `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function first checks if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`. This check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have after the operations: `mean = total // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean amount.

3. **Loop to Check Feasibility:**
   - The function iterates through each container.
   - For each container, it updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current amount of water in the container and the mean amount.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO'. This is because if `curr` is negative, it means that the cumulative amount of water in the containers up to that point is less than the expected cumulative mean, which implies that it is impossible to balance the water using the given operations (since water can only be poured from a container with more water to a container with less water, and `i < j`).

4. **Final Check:**
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES'. This indicates that it is possible to balance the water in all containers.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- The logic inside `func_1` is sound. The check for `total % n != 0` is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness since the problem guarantees that the sum is divisible by `n`.
- The loop correctly tracks the cumulative difference and ensures that the water can be balanced by checking if `curr` ever becomes negative.
- The program returns the correct output for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
