### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initial Checks**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `nums` as the argument.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(nums)`.
   - It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n` using `total % n != 0`. If not, it returns 'NO'. However, this check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

3. **Cumulative Difference Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have: `mean = total // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference from the mean as the function iterates through the list.
   - The function iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean: `curr += nums[i] - mean`.

4. **Negative Cumulative Difference Check**:
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, the function returns 'NO'. This is because a negative `curr` indicates that the amount of water in the containers processed so far is less than the required mean, and it is impossible to balance the containers by only pouring water from left to right (i.e., from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index).

5. **Final Return**:
   - If the function completes the iteration without encountering a negative `curr`, it returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the problem's constraints and guarantees.
- The logic of checking the cumulative difference is sound. If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means that the containers cannot be balanced by the given operations.
- The function returns 'YES' if the cumulative difference remains non-negative throughout the iteration, which is the correct condition for the problem.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
