Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect in its conclusion that the program is **False**. Let's break down the logic of the program and the problem description to understand why the program is actually correct.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the operation of pouring water from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.
- **Constraints**: The sum of the amounts of water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers, `n`.

### Program Logic:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers, `n`, and the list of water amounts, `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initial Check**: The program checks if the sum of the water amounts, `total`, is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'. However, the problem guarantees that `total % n == 0`, so this check will always pass.
   - **Calculate Mean**: The mean amount of water per container, `mean`, is calculated as `total // n`.
   - **Cumulative Sum Check**: The program maintains a cumulative sum, `curr`, and iterates through the list `nums`. For each element, it updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current element and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

### Key Points:
- **Cumulative Sum Check**: The critical part of the program is the cumulative sum check. The idea is to ensure that at no point during the process of redistributing water does the cumulative sum of the differences from the mean become negative. This is because if `curr` becomes negative, it means that more water has been poured out than can be poured back in, which violates the constraint that water can only be poured from a lower-index container to a higher-index container.

### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1**: `1 3 2 4`
  - `total = 10`, `n = 4`, `mean = 2.5` (which is not an integer, but the problem guarantees it will be).
  - The program calculates:
    - `curr = 1 - 2.5 = -1.5` (negative, so it returns 'NO').
  - This is correct because it is impossible to make all containers have 2.5 units of water using the given operation.

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n` and ensures that the cumulative sum of the differences from the mean does not become negative. This is a valid approach because:
  - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means that the water cannot be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water while adhering to the constraint that water can only be poured from a lower-index container to a higher-index container.
  - If `curr` remains non-negative throughout the loop, it means that the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is sound and correctly implements the necessary checks to determine if the water can be evenly distributed. The original assessment incorrectly identified a flaw in the program's logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
