The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` and checks if it is possible to make all elements in the list equal by performing a series of operations where each element can be increased or decreased by 1. The function returns 'NO' if at any point during the process, the current cumulative difference from the mean becomes negative, indicating that it is not possible to achieve the goal. If the function completes the iteration without encountering a negative cumulative difference, it returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all elements equal.
