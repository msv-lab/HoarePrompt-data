Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, but the distribution of water cannot be made equal by pouring water only from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```
The average amount of water is `(1 + 3 + 2 + 4) // 4 = 2.5`, which is not an integer, but the program checks for divisibility by `n` and proceeds to the next step. However, the problem description guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so the average should always be an integer. The issue is in the logic of the `func_1` function, which incorrectly returns 'NO' if at any point `curr` becomes negative. This logic fails to account for the possibility that water can be poured from a higher-index container to a lower-index container in a subsequent step to balance the distribution.

A correct approach would involve checking if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed across all containers, and then ensuring that the operation constraints (i.e., pouring from a lower-index container to a higher-index container) can be met to achieve this distribution. The current program does not correctly handle this, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
