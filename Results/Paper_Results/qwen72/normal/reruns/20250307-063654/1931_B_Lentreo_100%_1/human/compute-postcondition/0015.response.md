Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), each element `a_i` in `nums` is an integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. `n` is equal to the length of `nums` and is greater than 1. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `mean` is the integer value of `total // n`. `total % n` is equal to 0. `curr` is now `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean`, and `i` is 1. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.***
