You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers where the length of nums is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element a_i in nums is an integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in nums is divisible by n.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of integers where the length of `nums` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` in `nums` is an integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. `n` is now equal to the length of `nums`. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. Additionally, `total % n` is equal to 0.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `nums` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), each element `a_i` in `nums` is an integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. `n` is equal to the length of `nums` and is greater than 0. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `mean` is the integer value of `total // n`. `total % n` is equal to 0. `curr` is now the sum of all elements in `nums` minus `n * mean`, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `curr` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `curr` is 0.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 'NO' in most cases. It returns 'YES' in a specific case that is not fully described.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'.

Case_3: The program returns 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns 'NO'

Case_5: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
