Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if the total is divisible by `n`. Since the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, this check is always true and does not affect the correctness of the program.

3. **Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have after the operations, which is `total // n`.

4. **Operation Feasibility Check**: The program then iterates through the list of water amounts and maintains a cumulative difference `curr` between the current amount of water and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that it is not possible to balance the water using the allowed operations (pouring from a container to a container with a higher index). If `curr` remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it means that the water can be balanced.

5. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" if it is possible to balance the water and "NO" otherwise, which matches the problem's requirements.

The logic and implementation are sound and align with the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
