### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `nums` as input.
   - It calculates the total amount of water in all containers.
   - It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. This check is indeed redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water each container should have, which is `total // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean amount.

3. **Cumulative Difference Check:**
   - The program iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO' because it means that it is impossible to balance the water without violating the `i < j` constraint.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `nums` is a list of integers where the length of `nums` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` in `nums` is an integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - `n = len(nums)` correctly sets `n` to the length of `nums`.
  - `total = sum(nums)` correctly calculates the total amount of water.
  - The check `if total % n != 0` is redundant and will never be true given the problem constraints.
  - `mean = total // n` correctly calculates the mean amount of water each container should have.
  - `curr = 0` initializes the cumulative difference to 0.
  - The loop `for i in range(n)` iterates through each container.
  - `curr += nums[i] - mean` updates the cumulative difference.
  - `if curr < 0` checks if the cumulative difference becomes negative. If it does, the function returns 'NO' because it indicates that the left containers do not have enough water to balance the right containers.
  - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES'.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 1`, `nums = [43]`
  - Mean = 43
  - `curr` remains 0 throughout the loop.
  - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `nums = [1, 3]`
  - Mean = 2
  - `curr` becomes -1 after the first container, which is negative.
  - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 5`, `nums = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`
  - Mean = 3
  - `curr` values: 1, 3, 1, 0, 0
  - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `n = 3`, `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
  - Mean = 2
  - `curr` values: -1, -1, 0
  - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - `n = 7`, `nums = [4, 5, 5, 0, 6, 4, 4]`
  - Mean = 4
  - `curr` values: 0, 1, 2, -2, 0, 0, 0
  - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

- **Test Case 6:**
  - `n = 7`, `nums = [6, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4]`
  - Mean = 4
  - `curr` values: 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2
  - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The cumulative difference check ensures that the operation constraints are respected, and the program handles all test cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
