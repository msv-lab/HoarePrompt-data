Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), each element `a_i` in `nums` is an integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. `n` is equal to the length of `nums` and is greater than 0. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `mean` is the integer value of `total // n`. `total % n` is equal to 0. `curr` is now the sum of all elements in `nums` minus `n * mean`, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `curr` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `curr` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list `nums`.
- In each iteration, `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the current element `nums[i]` and the mean value `mean`.
- The mean value `mean` is calculated as `total // n`, where `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
- Since the sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, the mean value `mean` is an integer.
- After `n` iterations, `curr` will be the sum of all differences `nums[i] - mean` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The sum of all elements in `nums` is `total`, and the sum of `n * mean` is also `total` because `mean` is `total // n`.
- Therefore, `curr` will be `total - n * mean`, which simplifies to `total - total`, resulting in `curr` being 0.
- If at any point during the loop `curr` becomes less than 0, the loop will return 'NO'. Otherwise, after all iterations, `curr` will be 0.
