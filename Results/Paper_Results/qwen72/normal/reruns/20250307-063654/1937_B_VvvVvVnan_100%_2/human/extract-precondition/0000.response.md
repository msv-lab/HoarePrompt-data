Precondition: **The function should accept multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) and two binary strings of length n, representing the two rows of the grid. The function should return the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for each test case.**
