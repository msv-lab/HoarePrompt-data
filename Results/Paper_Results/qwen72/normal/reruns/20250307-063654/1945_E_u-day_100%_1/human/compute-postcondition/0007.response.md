The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is 0 if the first element of `arr` is equal to the current value of `k`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is 0 if the first element of `arr` is equal to the current value of `k`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
