To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider which variables are part of the loop head and how they change. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`
- `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is 1 if `arr[i]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- `n` remains the same, so `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`k`, `arr`, and `pos`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is 1 if `arr[i]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
