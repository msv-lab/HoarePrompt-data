Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the permutation is not sorted and requires more than one swap to make the binary search work correctly. For example, consider the input where `n = 6`, `x = 3`, and the permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`. The program will only perform one swap, which is insufficient to make the binary search work correctly in this case. The correct output should be `2` swaps, but the program only outputs `1` swap. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
