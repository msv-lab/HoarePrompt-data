Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is 1 if `arr[i]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.***
