To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `low + 1 < high`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`

The loop condition `low + 1 < high` translates to `0 + 1 < n`, which simplifies to `1 < n`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 1. Since the initial state already specifies that `n` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set.**
