To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `while low + 1 < high`. The variables `low` and `high` are the only ones that can be adjusted to ensure the loop condition remains true.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `low` is 0 or `n // 2`
- `high` is `n // 2` or `n`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is `n-1`
- `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`
- `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise it remains -1
- `st` is a set containing the value `n // 2`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true. Let's analyze the possible values of `low` and `high`:

1. If `low` is 0 and `high` is `n // 2`:
   - `low + 1` is 1
   - `high` is `n // 2`
   - The condition `1 < n // 2` must be true. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n // 2` must be greater than 1 for the condition to hold. This implies `n` must be greater than 2.

2. If `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`:
   - `low + 1` is `n // 2 + 1`
   - `high` is `n`
   - The condition `n // 2 + 1 < n` must be true. Since `n` is greater than 1, this condition will always be true as long as `n` is greater than 2.

Given that `n` is greater than 1, the condition `low + 1 < high` will be true if `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to `low` or `high` as long as `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, and `st` is a set containing the value `n // 2`.**
