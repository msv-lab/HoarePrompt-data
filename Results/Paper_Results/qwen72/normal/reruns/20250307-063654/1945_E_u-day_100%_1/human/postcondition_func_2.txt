The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly but calls `func_1` to get `n` and `k`, and `func_2` to get `arr`. It then searches for the integer `k` in the permutation list `arr`. If `k` is found, it sets `pos` to the index of `k` in `arr`. The function also performs a binary search to determine the position of `k` in the sorted list `arr`. If `k` is found in `arr`, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than `k` (incremented by 1) and the value `0` (since `pos` remains -1 and is incremented by 1). The final state of the program includes `pos` being set to the index of `k` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1. The set `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the binary search, and `low` and `high` are the indices of the largest and smallest elements in `arr` that are less than or equal to and greater than `k`, respectively.
