Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The variable `n` is still greater than 0, indicating that the loop had at least one iteration.
- The variable `i` is set to `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `arr` that the loop iterated over.
- The variable `k` has been updated to the value returned by `func_1()`.
- The list `arr` has been updated to the value returned by `func_2()`, and it still contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in some permutation.
- The variable `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found in `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` remains -1.
