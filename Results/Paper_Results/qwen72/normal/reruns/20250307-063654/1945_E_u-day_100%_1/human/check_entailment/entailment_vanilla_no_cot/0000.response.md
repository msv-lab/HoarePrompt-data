Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search will find the element `x` at the correct position. However, the program only performs a single swap if the binary search does not find `x` at the position `low`. This is insufficient to guarantee that the binary search will find `x` in all cases, especially when more than one swap is needed.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where multiple swaps are required. The logic for determining the swaps is also flawed, as it does not consider the correct positions for the elements to be swapped to ensure the binary search will work correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
2. Determine the correct position where `x` should be for the binary search to find it.
3. Perform swaps to move `x` to this correct position, ensuring that the binary search will find it. This may involve more than one swap, and the program should be able to handle this.

The current program does not meet these requirements, hence it is incorrect.
