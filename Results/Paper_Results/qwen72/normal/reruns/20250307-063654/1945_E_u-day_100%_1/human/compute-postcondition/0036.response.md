Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is the index of the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, and `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` is greater than 1**: This remains true as it was in the initial state.
- **`i` is `n-1`**: This also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`k` is the value returned by `func_1()`**: This value remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`**: This list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise remains -1**: This variable is not updated within the loop, so its value remains as it was after the initial checks.
- **`low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`**: The loop continues to narrow down the range `[low, high)` until `low` and `high` are adjacent. `low` will be the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- **`high` is the index of the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`**: Similarly, `high` will be the index of the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.
- **`st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution**: The set `st` will contain all the midpoints that were calculated during the loop, which are the values of `mid` at each iteration. These midpoints are the points where the loop checked the value of `arr[mid]` against `k`.

The loop essentially performs a binary search on the list `arr` to find the position of `k`. When the loop terminates, `low` and `high` will be adjacent indices, with `low` being the index of the largest element less than or equal to `k` and `high` being the index of the smallest element greater than `k`. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints that were checked during the search.
