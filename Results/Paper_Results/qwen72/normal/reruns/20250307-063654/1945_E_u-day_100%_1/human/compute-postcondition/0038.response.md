Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than 1.
2. `i` is set to `n-1`.
3. `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
4. `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing a permutation. It is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`.
5. `k` is found in `arr`.
6. `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`, which is `low`.
7. `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
8. `high` is the index of the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.
9. `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `0`.
- The initial state provides detailed information about the variables and objects, but none of this information is used in the `print` statement.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
