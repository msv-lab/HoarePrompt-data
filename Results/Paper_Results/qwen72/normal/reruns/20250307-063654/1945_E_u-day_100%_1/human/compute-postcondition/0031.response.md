Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set containing the value `n // 2`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` which is `n // 2`.**
