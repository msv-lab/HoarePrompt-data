Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers. It is used to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - The function works correctly for the given input format.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers. It is used to read the permutation `arr`.
   - The function works correctly for the given input format.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function processes each test case. It reads `n` and `k` using `func_1`, and the permutation `arr` using `func_2`.
   - It then searches for the index of `k` in `arr` and stores it in `pos`.
   - The function performs a binary search to determine the position of `k` in the sorted list `arr`.
   - If `k` is found at the position `low` after the binary search, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `k` is not found at the position `low`, it prints `1` followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped to move `k` to the correct position.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation of `func_3`:

- **Binary Search Initialization**:
  - The binary search initialization should be `low = 0` and `high = n`, not `low = 0` and `high = n + 1`. The problem description specifies that `r = n + 1` is not necessary and can lead to out-of-bounds errors.

- **Binary Search Logic**:
  - The binary search logic is correct in terms of narrowing down the range, but it does not handle the case where `k` is not in the sorted position correctly.
  - The function should also consider the case where `k` is not found in the permutation, which is not possible according to the problem constraints (since `k` is guaranteed to be in the permutation).

- **Swapping Logic**:
  - The function prints `1` followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped to move `k` to the correct position. However, it does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed to make the binary search work correctly.
  - The problem specifies that up to 2 swaps can be performed, but the function only performs 1 swap.

Given these issues, the function `func_3` does not meet the problem's requirements of ensuring that `k` is found correctly after at most 2 swaps.

Correctness: **False**
