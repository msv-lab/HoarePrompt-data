Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the input and splits it into integers, which is appropriate for reading the first line of each test case (containing `n` and `k`).
   - `func_2` reads the next line and converts it into a list of integers, which is suitable for reading the permutation `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**:
   - The function `func_3` iterates over the permutation `arr` to find the index of `k` and stores it in `pos`. This is necessary to know where `k` is located in the permutation.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search is performed to find the position where `k` should be if the array were sorted. The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which is a standard condition for binary search.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated and used to update `low` or `high` based on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than or less than `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it means `k` is found at the correct position, and the function prints `0` (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, the function prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. This is intended to swap the element at `low` with the element at `pos` to place `k` at the correct position.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k` is not found in the permutation by setting `pos` to `-1`.
   - The function correctly prints the indices for the swap, but there is a potential issue: if `k` is not found in the permutation, `pos` will be `-1`, and `pos + 1` will be `0`. This means the function will always try to swap the element at `low` with the first element in the permutation, which might not be the correct swap.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm is designed to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `k` is found at the correct position after the binary search.
   - However, the current implementation only performs 1 swap, and it does not handle the case where `k` is not found in the permutation correctly. It should print `0` if `k` is not found, as the problem does not require finding `k` if it is not in the permutation.

7. **Final Check**:
   - The function does not handle the case where `k` is not in the permutation, which is a critical flaw. The problem statement guarantees that `k` is in the permutation, but the function should still correctly handle this case to be robust.

Given the above reasoning, the function is not fully correct because it does not handle the case where `k` is not found in the permutation, and it only performs 1 swap instead of potentially 2 swaps as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
