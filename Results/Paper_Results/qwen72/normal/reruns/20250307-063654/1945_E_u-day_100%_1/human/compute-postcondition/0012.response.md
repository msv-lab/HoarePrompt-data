Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, `pos` is set to 2. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.***
