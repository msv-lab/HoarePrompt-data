### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using a binary search algorithm.
   - We are allowed to perform at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running the binary search.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation:**
   - Binary search is designed to work on sorted arrays. In a permutation, the elements are not sorted, so we need to ensure that the element `x` is in the correct position relative to the binary search's mid-point calculations.
   - The binary search algorithm provided in the problem description is correct for a sorted array, but it needs to be adapted for the permutation.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1`**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This is used to read the test case parameters and the permutation.
   - **`func_2`**: Converts the output of `func_1` into a list. This is used to read the permutation.
   - **`func_3`**:
     - Reads the test case parameters `n` and `x`.
     - Reads the permutation `arr`.
     - Finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
     - Initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
     - Performs the binary search to find the position `low` where `x` should be.
     - If `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, no swaps are needed.
     - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it prints one swap to move `x` to the correct position.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is correct. It narrows down the search range by comparing the middle element with `x`.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which ensures that the search range is reduced to a single element.

5. **Swap Logic:**
   - The program only performs one swap if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`. This swap moves `x` to the position `low`.
   - However, the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program only needs to output one swap if it can achieve the goal with one.
   - The program does not handle the case where more than one swap might be needed, but it is not required to do so according to the problem statement.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position (`arr[low] == x`).
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position and needs to be moved.

7. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the number of swaps (0 or 1) and the indices of the swap if needed.
   - This matches the required output format.

### Challenges and Inaccuracies in the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program only performs one swap if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`. This is correct, but it does not fully address the requirement that up to 2 swaps are allowed.
- The function summary for `func_3` is slightly incorrect. It states that if `arr[low]` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than `k` and the value `0`. However, the program actually prints `1` followed by the indices of the swap to move `x` to the correct position.
- The program does not handle the case where more than one swap might be needed, but this is not a requirement according to the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct for the given problem. It correctly finds the position of `x` in the permutation and performs the necessary swap to ensure that the binary search will find `x` correctly. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program only needs to output one swap if it can achieve the goal with one.

Final: **True**
