Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pos = i` updates the value of `pos` to the current value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `pos` while maintaining the initial conditions of the other variables.
