The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n representing the number to be found, and `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation. The function returns the index of `k` in the permutation `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
