Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `high` is the index of the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`. `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, `pos` is set to `low`. If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, `pos` remains -1.***
