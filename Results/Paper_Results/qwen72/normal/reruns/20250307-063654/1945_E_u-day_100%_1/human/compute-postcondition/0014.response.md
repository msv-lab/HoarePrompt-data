Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the values 0 and `n` to the variables `low` and `high`, respectively. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged from the initial state. The initial state information is still valid, and the new variables `low` and `high` are now part of the output state.
