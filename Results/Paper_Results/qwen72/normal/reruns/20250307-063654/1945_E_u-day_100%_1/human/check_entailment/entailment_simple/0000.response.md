### Reasoning:

1. **Function Calls and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_3()` for each test case.
   - `func_1()` reads the input for `n` and `k` and returns them as integers.
   - `func_2()` reads the permutation `arr` and returns it as a list of integers.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - The program correctly finds the index `pos` of the element `k` in the permutation `arr` using a simple loop.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to 0 and `n` respectively.
   - It then performs a binary search to find the position of `k` in the permutation.
   - The binary search loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which is a standard condition for binary search.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low] == k`, the program correctly prints `0` because no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low] != k`, the program prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a single swap.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program assumes that `pos` will always be found in the permutation, which is true because the input is guaranteed to be a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where `pos` is not found, which is not possible given the problem constraints.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of needing more than one swap to make the binary search work correctly. The problem states that up to 2 swaps are allowed, but the program only prints one swap.

6. **Correctness of the Binary Search:**
   - The binary search is performed correctly, but it assumes that the permutation can be made sorted with at most one swap, which is not always the case.
   - For example, if `k` is at a position that requires more than one swap to make the binary search work, the program will still only print one swap, which may not be sufficient.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not always ensure that the binary search will find the correct position of `k` after at most 2 swaps. The program only prints one swap, which is not always sufficient to make the binary search work correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**
