The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `low + 1 < high`. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` which is `n // 2`.

- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `high` is updated to `n // 2`.
- If `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`, `low` is updated to `n // 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must still be true after the updates. Let's consider both cases:

1. **If `high` is updated to `n // 2`:**
   - `low` remains 0.
   - `high` is now `n // 2`.
   - The condition `low + 1 < high` becomes `0 + 1 < n // 2`, which simplifies to `1 < n // 2`.

2. **If `low` is updated to `n // 2`:**
   - `low` is now `n // 2`.
   - `high` remains `n`.
   - The condition `low + 1 < high` becomes `n // 2 + 1 < n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, either of these conditions must be true:
- `1 < n // 2` (if `high` was updated to `n // 2`).
- `n // 2 + 1 < n` (if `low` was updated to `n // 2`).

Given that `n` is greater than 1, both conditions can be true depending on the value of `n`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set containing the value `n // 2`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` which is `n // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `high` is updated to `n // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`, `low` is updated to `n // 2`.**
