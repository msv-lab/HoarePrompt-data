Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set containing the values `n // 2` and `mid` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`, which simplifies to `n // 2`.
- The set `st` initially contains the value `n // 2`.
- The code `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` (which is `n // 2`) to the set `st`.
- Since `mid` is already in `st`, the set `st` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) retain their initial values.
