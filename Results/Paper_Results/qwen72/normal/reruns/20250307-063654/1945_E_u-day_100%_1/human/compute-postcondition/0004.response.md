Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, and the first element of `arr` is equal to the current value of `k`.**
