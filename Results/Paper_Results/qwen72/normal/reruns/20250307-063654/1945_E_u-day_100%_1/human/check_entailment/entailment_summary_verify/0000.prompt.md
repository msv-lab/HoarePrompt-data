You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly but calls `func_1` to get `n` and `k`, and `func_2` to get `arr`. It then searches for the integer `k` in the permutation list `arr`. If `k` is found, it sets `pos` to the index of `k` in `arr`. The function also performs a binary search to determine the position of `k` in the sorted list `arr`. If `k` is found in `arr`, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than `k` (incremented by 1) and the value `0` (since `pos` remains -1 and is incremented by 1). The final state of the program includes `pos` being set to the index of `k` if `k` is found, otherwise `pos` remains -1. The set `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the binary search, and `low` and `high` are the indices of the largest and smallest elements in `arr` that are less than or equal to and greater than `k`, respectively.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the permutation is not sorted and requires more than one swap to make the binary search work correctly. For example, consider the input where `n = 6`, `x = 3`, and the permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`. The program will only perform one swap, which is insufficient to make the binary search work correctly in this case. The correct output should be `2` swaps, but the program only outputs `1` swap. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
