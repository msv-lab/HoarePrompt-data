Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation, and `arr` is now updated to the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1.**

In natural language: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_1()`. The list `arr` initially contains a permutation of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and it is then updated to the value returned by the function `func_2()`. The variable `pos` is set to -1. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
