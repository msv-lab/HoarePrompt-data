To determine what will be printed by the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
   - `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing a permutation.
   - `arr` is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`.
   - If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
   - `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `high` is the index of the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.
   - `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Since `arr` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, it contains all unique integers in that range.
   - `k` is a value returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is updated by `func_2()`. The exact values of `k` and `arr` are not provided, but we know `arr` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `high` is the index of the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.
   - `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, otherwise it remains -1.
   - The condition `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` implies that `k` is not present in `arr` at the index `low`.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since `pos` remains -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, and the condition `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` indicates that `k` is not in `arr`, `pos` will be -1.
   - `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`. Since `k` is not in `arr`, `low` will be the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than `k`.
   - The `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement will print `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - `low + 1` will be the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than `k`, incremented by 1.
   - `pos + 1` will be -1 + 1, which is 0.

Output: **low + 1, 0 (where low is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than `k`)**
