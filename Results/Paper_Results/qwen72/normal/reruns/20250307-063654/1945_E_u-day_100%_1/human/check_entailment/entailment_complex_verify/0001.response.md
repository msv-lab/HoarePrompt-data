### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search. However, the permutation is not necessarily sorted, so we can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works correctly on a sorted array. In this problem, we need to ensure that the element `x` is in the correct position relative to the binary search's mid-point calculations.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1`**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This is used to read the test case parameters and the permutation.
   - **`func_2`**: Converts the output of `func_1` into a list. This is used to read the permutation.
   - **`func_3`**: 
     - Reads the test case parameters `n` and `x`.
     - Reads the permutation `arr`.
     - Finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
     - Initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
     - Performs the binary search to find the position `low` where `x` should be.
     - If `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, no swaps are needed.
     - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it prints one swap to move `x` to the correct position.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is correct. It narrows down the search range by comparing the middle element with `x`.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which ensures that the search range is reduced to a single element.

5. **Swap Logic:**
   - The program only performs one swap if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`. This swap moves `x` to the position `low`.
   - The program does not handle the case where more than one swap might be needed, but the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program only needs to output one swap if it can achieve the goal with one.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position (`arr[low] == x`).
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position and needs to be moved.

7. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the number of swaps (0 or 1) and the indices of the swap if needed.
   - This matches the required output format.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x` using `func_1` and the permutation `arr` using `func_2`.

- **Finding the Position of `x`:**
  - The program correctly finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation `arr`.

- **Binary Search:**
  - The binary search is implemented correctly. It initializes `low` and `high` and iteratively narrows down the search range.
  - The loop condition `low + 1 < high` ensures that the search range is reduced to a single element.

- **Swap Output:**
  - If `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, the program correctly outputs `0` (no swaps needed).
  - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, the program outputs `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap `x` to the correct position.

### Issues and Corrections:

- **Incorrect Swap Output:**
  - The program outputs `1` followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1` when `x` is not in the correct position.
  - However, if `pos` is `-1` (i.e., `x` is not found in the permutation), the program will output `1` followed by `low + 1` and `0`, which is incorrect because `0` is not a valid index in the permutation.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    elif pos == -1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

### Final Evaluation:

- **Correctness:**
  - The original program is mostly correct but has a minor issue where it outputs `0` for the swap indices if `x` is not found in the permutation.
  - The corrected code addresses this issue by checking if `pos` is `-1` and outputting `0` swaps in that case.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the issue with swap indices when `x` is not found in the permutation.)
