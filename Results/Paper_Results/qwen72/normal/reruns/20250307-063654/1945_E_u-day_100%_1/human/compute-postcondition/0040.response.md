Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than 1.
2. `i` is `n-1`.
3. `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
4. `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing a permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`.
5. If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
6. `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
7. `high` is the index of the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.
8. `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop execution.
9. `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and objects, but none of this context affects the `print` statement in the code snippet.
- The value `1` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
