You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We need to perform at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation such that a binary search will correctly find `x`.
   - The binary search algorithm is provided and works by maintaining two pointers `l` and `r` and narrowing down the search range until `r - l = 1`.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works correctly on a sorted array. However, in this problem, we are dealing with a permutation, which is not necessarily sorted.
   - To make the binary search work, we need to ensure that the element `x` is in the correct position relative to the binary search's mid-point calculations.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1`**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This is used to read the test case parameters and the permutation.
   - **`func_2`**: Converts the output of `func_1` into a list. This is used to read the permutation.
   - **`func_3`**: 
     - Reads the test case parameters `n` and `x`.
     - Reads the permutation `arr`.
     - Finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
     - Initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
     - Performs the binary search to find the position `low` where `x` should be.
     - If `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, no swaps are needed.
     - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it prints one swap to move `x` to the correct position.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is correct. It narrows down the search range by comparing the middle element with `x`.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which ensures that the search range is reduced to a single element.

5. **Swap Logic:**
   - The program only performs one swap if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`. This swap moves `x` to the position `low`.
   - The program does not handle the case where more than one swap might be needed, but the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program only needs to output one swap if it can achieve the goal with one.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position (`arr[low] == x`).
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position and needs to be moved.

7. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the number of swaps (0 or 1) and the indices of the swap if needed.
   - This matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem. It correctly finds the position of `x` in the permutation and performs the necessary swap to ensure that the binary search will find `x` correctly.

Correctness: **True**
