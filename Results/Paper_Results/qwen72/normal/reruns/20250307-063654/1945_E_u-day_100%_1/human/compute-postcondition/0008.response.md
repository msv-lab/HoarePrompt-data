Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation and is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial condition for `pos` (0 if the first element of `arr` is equal to the current value of `k`, otherwise -1) is overridden by the new assignment `pos = i`.
