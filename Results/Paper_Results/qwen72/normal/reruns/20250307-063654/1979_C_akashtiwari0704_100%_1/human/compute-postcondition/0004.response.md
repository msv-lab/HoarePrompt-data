Output State: **`l` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`**

Explanation: The variable `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `g` and the first element of the list `l`. The list `l` still has at least one element, and `i` remains 0.
