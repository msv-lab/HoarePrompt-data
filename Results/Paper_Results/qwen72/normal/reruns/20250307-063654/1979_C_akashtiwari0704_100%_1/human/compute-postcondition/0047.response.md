Output State: **`sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `i` is 2, `bets` is the number of iterations, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `T` is `t - 1`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is updated to `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`, `l` is a list with at least 3 elements.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`.
- All other variables (`sumo`, `i`, `bets`, `a[i]`, `T`, `t`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
