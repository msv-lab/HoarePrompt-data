Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`.
   - `i` is `bets - 1`.
   - `bets` is the number of iterations.
   - `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`.
   - `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `sumo`, `i`, `bets`, and `a[i]`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - The value `-1` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `-1` regardless of the values of `sumo`, `i`, `bets`, or `a[i]`.

Output: **-1**
