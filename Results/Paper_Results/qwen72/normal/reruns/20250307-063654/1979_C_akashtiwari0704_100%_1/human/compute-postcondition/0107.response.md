Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where each element is `prod // a[i]` for `i` in the range of `bets`, `bets` is an input integer, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for `i` in the range of `bets`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
