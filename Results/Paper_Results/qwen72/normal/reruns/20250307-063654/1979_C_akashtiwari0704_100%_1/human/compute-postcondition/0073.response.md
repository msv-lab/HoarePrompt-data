Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t - 1`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, each element `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[j]`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[0]` followed by a space and the value of `a[1]` followed by a space.**
