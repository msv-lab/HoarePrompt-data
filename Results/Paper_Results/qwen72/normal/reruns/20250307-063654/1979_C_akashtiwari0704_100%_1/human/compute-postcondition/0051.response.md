Functionality: ** The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all the elements in the list. The function modifies a variable `g` to compute the LCM, but it does not affect the input list `l` or any other external variables. After the function concludes, the program state is such that `g` holds the LCM of the elements in `l`. **
