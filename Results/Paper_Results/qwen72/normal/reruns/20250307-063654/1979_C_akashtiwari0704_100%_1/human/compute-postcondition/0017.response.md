The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `bets`. If `bets` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `sumo` being 0 does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `bets` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`sumo` is 0, `i` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 0**
