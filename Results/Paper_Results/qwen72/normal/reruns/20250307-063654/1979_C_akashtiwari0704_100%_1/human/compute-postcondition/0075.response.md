The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of the element at index `2` of the list `a` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. The initial state indicates that `bets` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of the list `a` is accessed and converted to a string. The value of `ans` is updated by appending this string and a space to its current value. The values of `bets` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[2]` followed by a space.**
