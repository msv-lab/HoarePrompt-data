The code snippet `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` updates the list `a` with new integer values provided by the user. The other variables (`bets`, `i`, `sumo`, `T`, `t`, `g`, `prod`) remain unchanged, but their values and relationships are still valid.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`.**
