`bets` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, each element `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[j]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`.**
