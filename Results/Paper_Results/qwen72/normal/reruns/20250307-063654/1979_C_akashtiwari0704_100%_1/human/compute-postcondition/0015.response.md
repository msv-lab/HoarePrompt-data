Output State: **The function `lcm` remains unchanged and can still accept a list `l` of integers and return the least common multiple (LCM) of all the elements in the list. The list `l` remains unchanged, and the variable `g` still holds the LCM of the elements in `l`. The variable `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input, and `bets` is still an input integer. The variable `prod` is now the LCM of the elements in `a`.**
