Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of integers `k` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The variable `t` is assigned the value of an input integer. The total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.**
