Postcondition: ***`sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `bets` is the number of iterations, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the state remains unchanged. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` each followed by a space.***
