Output State: **`sumo` is `prod // a[0]`, `i` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`**

Explanation:
- `sumo` is incremented by the integer value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `a[0]` is used.
- The value of `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]` as per the initial state.
- Therefore, `sumo` becomes `prod // a[0]`.
- The values of `i` and `bets` remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`.
