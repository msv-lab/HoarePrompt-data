The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `bets` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `bets` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2.
- `bets` must be greater than 2.

State: **`sumo` is `prod // a[0] + a[1]`, `i` is 2, `bets` must be greater than 2, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`**
