Output State: **`sumo` is `prod // a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, `i` is 2, `bets` must be greater than 2, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`**

The value of `sumo` is updated by adding the integer value of `a[2]` to its previous value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
