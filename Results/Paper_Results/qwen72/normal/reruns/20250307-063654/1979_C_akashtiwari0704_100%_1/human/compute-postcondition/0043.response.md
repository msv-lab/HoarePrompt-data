Output State: **`sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `i` is 0, `bets` is the number of iterations, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `T` is `t - 1`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` must be a non-empty list**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
- The other variables (`sumo`, `i`, `bets`, `a[i]`, `T`, `t`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
- Since `i` is 0, the specific update to `g` is `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`.
- The precondition that `l` must be a non-empty list is still valid.
