Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `T` is `t - 1`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.
- The values of `bets`, `sumo`, `i`, `T`, `t`, `g`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The new state of `a` is a list of integers based on the user's input.
