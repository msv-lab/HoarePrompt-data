Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bets` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is 1, `l` is a list with at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, each element `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[j]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is 0, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list with at least 1 element, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, each element `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[j]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, `l` is a list with at least 2 elements, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, each element `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[j]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is 2, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`, `l` is a list with at least 2 elements, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, each element `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[j]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
