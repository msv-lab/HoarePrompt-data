Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `bets` must be greater than 1, `sumo` is `prod // a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`**

Explanation:
- The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of `a[2]`.
- Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]`.
- The initial value of `sumo` is `prod // a[0] + a[1]`.
- After the code execution, `sumo` becomes `prod // a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
