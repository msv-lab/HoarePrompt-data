Output State: **`bets` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, `l` is a list with at least 2 elements, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, each element `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[j]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`.
- The values of `bets`, `i`, `sumo`, `T`, `t`, `l`, `a`, and `prod` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `a[j]` or setting `ans` remains the same, as it depends on the value of `sumo` relative to `prod`.
