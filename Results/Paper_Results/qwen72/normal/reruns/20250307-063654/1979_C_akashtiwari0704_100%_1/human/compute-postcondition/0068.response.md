Postcondition: **`bets` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t - 1`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, and each element `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[j]`. Additionally, `sumo` is less than `prod`.**
