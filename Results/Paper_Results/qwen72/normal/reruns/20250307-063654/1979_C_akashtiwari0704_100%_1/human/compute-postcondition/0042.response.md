To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`.

1. **`i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range` function and will start from 0.
2. **`l`**: The loop will execute if `l` is a non-empty list. The length of `l` determines how many times the loop will run.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`.
- `i` is `bets - 1`.
- `bets` is the number of iterations.
- `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`.
- `T` is `t - 1`.
- `t` is the total number of iterations.
- `g` is 1.

The loop head is:
```
for i in range(len(l)):
```

For the loop to execute:
- `l` must be a non-empty list. If `l` is empty, `len(l)` will be 0, and the loop will not execute.
- `i` will start from 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `l` is a non-empty list and `i` starts from 0.

State: **`sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `i` is 0, `bets` is the number of iterations, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `T` is `t - 1`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is 1, `l` must be a non-empty list**.
