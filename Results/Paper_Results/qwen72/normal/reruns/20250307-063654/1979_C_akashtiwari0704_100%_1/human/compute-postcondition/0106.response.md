Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list of integers where each element is `prod // a[i]` for `i` in the range of `bets`.
2. `bets` is an input integer.
3. `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for `i` in the range of `bets`.
4. `T` is `t`.
5. `t` is the total number of iterations.
6. `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`.
7. `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`.
8. `i` is `bets - 1`.
9. The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables. It is a straightforward print of a constant value.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
