Output State: **`sumo` is `prod // a[0] + a[1]`, `i` is 1, `bets` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`**

Explanation:
- `sumo` is updated by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`, and `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`.
- The new value of `sumo` is `prod // a[0] + a[1]`.
- The values of `i`, `bets`, `a[0]`, and `a[1]` remain unchanged.
