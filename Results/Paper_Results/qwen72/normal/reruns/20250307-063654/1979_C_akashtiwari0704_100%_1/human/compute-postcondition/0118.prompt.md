Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of integers `k` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The variable `t` is assigned the value of an input integer. The total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `i` is `bets - 1`, `bets` is the number of iterations, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the state remains unchanged. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` each followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`bets` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `t - 1`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, each element `a[j]` for `j` from 0 to `bets - 1` is now `prod // a[j]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers where each element is `prod // a[i]` for `i` in the range of `bets`, `bets` is an input integer, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for `i` in the range of `bets`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no changes are made. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of all elements in `a` separated by spaces, and `bets` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
