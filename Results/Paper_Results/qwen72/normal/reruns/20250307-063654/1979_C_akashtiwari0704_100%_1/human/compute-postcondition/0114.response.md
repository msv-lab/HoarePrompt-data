Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each element is `prod // a[i]` for `i` in the range of `bets`, `bets` must be greater than 1, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for `i` in the range of `bets`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[0]` followed by a space, the value of `a[1]` followed by a space, and now the value of `a[2]` followed by a space.**
