The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `bets` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `bets` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `i` is 2, `bets` must be greater than 2, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[0]` followed by a space and the value of `a[1]` followed by a space.**
