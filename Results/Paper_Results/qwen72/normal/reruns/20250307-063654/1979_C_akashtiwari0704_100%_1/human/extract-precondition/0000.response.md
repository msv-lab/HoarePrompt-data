Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of integers `k` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The function should ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.**
