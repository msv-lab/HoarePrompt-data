Output State: **The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all the elements in the list. After the function concludes, the list `l` remains unchanged, and the variable `g` holds the LCM of the elements in `l`. The function does not modify any other variables or state outside of its scope. `bets` is an input integer.**
