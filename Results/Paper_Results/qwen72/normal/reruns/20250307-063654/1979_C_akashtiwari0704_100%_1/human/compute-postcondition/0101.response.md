The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `bets`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `bets` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. `bets` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `bets` must be greater than 1, `sumo` is `prod // a[0] + a[1]`, `T` is `t`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `l`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `a`, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`**
