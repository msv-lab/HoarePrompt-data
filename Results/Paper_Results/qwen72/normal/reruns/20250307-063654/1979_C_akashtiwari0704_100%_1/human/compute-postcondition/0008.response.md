Output State: **`l` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `g` is updated to `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The precondition that `l` must have at least 3 elements is still valid.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
