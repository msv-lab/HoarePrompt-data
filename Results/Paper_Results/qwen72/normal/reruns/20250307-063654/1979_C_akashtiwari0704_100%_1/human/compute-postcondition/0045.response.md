Output State: **`sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `i` is 1, `bets` is the number of iterations, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `T` is `t - 1`, `t` is the total number of iterations, `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, `l` is a list with at least 2 elements.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function. The other variables (`sumo`, `i`, `bets`, `a[i]`, `T`, `t`, and `l`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states.
