To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while a and a[0] == 0:
```

This loop will execute if two conditions are met:
1. The list `a` is not empty (`a` is truthy).
2. The first element of the list `a` is 0 (`a[0] == 0`).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed.
- `res` is 0.
- `i` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`).

The only objects in the loop head that can be adjusted are `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a` must be non-empty**: The list `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
2. **First element of `a` must be 0**: The first element of the list `a` must be 0 for the loop to execute.

### Current State:
- `a` is a list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed. This means that if `a` is non-empty, the first element of `a` cannot be 0 (since leading zeros are removed).

### Adjustment Needed:
- To make the loop execute, we need to adjust `a` so that it is non-empty and its first element is 0. However, since `a` is already described as having leading zeros removed, the only way to ensure the loop executes is to modify the state of `a` to include a leading zero.

### Final State:
- `a` must be a non-empty list with a leading zero.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with a leading zero, `res` is 0, `i` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`)**.
