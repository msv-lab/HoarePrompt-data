Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and the last element of `a` is no longer 0 (it has been removed), `res` is 0, `i` is the last index of the updated list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`)**. 

The last element of `a` has been removed, so the list `a` is now one element shorter. The variable `i` is updated to reflect the new last index of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
