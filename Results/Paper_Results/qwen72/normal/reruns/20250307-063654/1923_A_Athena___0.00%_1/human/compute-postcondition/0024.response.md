The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a`. The loop's execution depends on the length of the list `a` and the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is a list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed that must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must have at least one more element (i.e., at least 2 elements) for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` remains 0, and `i` is 1**
