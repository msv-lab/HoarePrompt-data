You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers 0 or 1. The function removes all leading and trailing zeros from `a`, then counts the number of zeros remaining in the list. It prints the modified list `a` and the count of zeros for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases `t`.
   - Each test case contains two lines:
     - The first line is the number of cells `n`.
     - The second line is a list of `n` integers `a` where `0` represents a free cell and `1` represents a cell with a chip.
   - Constraints: \(1 \le t \le 1000\), \(2 \le n \le 50\), and at least one cell contains a chip.

2. **Goal:**
   - Move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.
   - Minimize the number of operations required.

3. **Operations:**
   - Choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left.
   - The cell where the chip was before the operation becomes free.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of integers `a`.

2. **Trimming the List:**
   - The program trims the list `a` by removing leading and trailing zeros.
   - This step is crucial because it effectively reduces the problem to the subarray containing all the chips and the free cells between them.

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program then counts the number of free cells (`0`s) within the trimmed list.
   - The idea is that the number of free cells within the trimmed list is the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result `res` for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
- **Trimming the List:**
  - Removing leading and trailing zeros is correct because it isolates the subarray where the chips are located and the free cells between them.
  - This step ensures that we only consider the relevant part of the ribbon.

- **Counting Free Cells:**
  - The number of free cells within the trimmed list is indeed the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.
  - Each free cell represents a gap that needs to be filled by moving a chip to the left.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If all chips are already in a single block, the trimmed list will contain no free cells, and the program will correctly output `0`.
  - If there are no free cells between the chips, the program will also correctly output `0`.

- **General Case:**
  - For cases where there are free cells between the chips, the program will count these free cells and output the correct number of operations.

### Example Verification:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - Trimmed list: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
  - Free cells: `1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `6`, `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - Trimmed list: `1`
  - Free cells: `0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `6`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Trimmed list: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Free cells: `0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Trimmed list: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - Free cells: `2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `9`, `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - Trimmed list: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
  - Free cells: `3`
  - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It trims the list to focus on the relevant subarray and counts the free cells within this subarray, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.
