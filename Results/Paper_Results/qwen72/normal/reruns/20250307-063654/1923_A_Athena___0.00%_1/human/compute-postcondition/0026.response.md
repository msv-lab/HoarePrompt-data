Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element is 0. Otherwise, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, and 0 if the first element of `a` is not 0.***
