Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and the last element of `a` is now the second-to-last element before the code execution, `res` is 0, `i` is the last index of the updated list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`)**

Explanation:
- The last element of `a` is removed using `a.pop()`.
- Since `a` was a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and the last element was 0, the last element is now the second-to-last element before the code execution.
- The value of `i` is updated to the last index of the updated list `a`, which is `len(a) - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
