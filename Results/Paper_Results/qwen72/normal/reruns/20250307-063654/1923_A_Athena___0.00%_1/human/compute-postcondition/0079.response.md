Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and the last element of `a` is now removed, `res` is 0, `i` is the last index of the updated list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`)**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now `t - 1`.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
- The last element of the list `a` is removed using `a.pop()`, so the last element of `a` is no longer 0.
- The value of `res` remains 0.
- The index `i` is updated to the last index of the updated list `a`, which is now `len(a) - 1`.
