Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list without a leading zero (but now with one less element at the beginning), `res` is 0, `i` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`)**

The value of `t` remains greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`. The value of `n` remains an input integer. The list `a` is still non-empty and without a leading zero, but it now has one less element at the beginning due to the `pop(0)` operation. The value of `res` remains 0. The value of `i` is now the last index of the updated list `a`, which is `len(a) - 1`.
