Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed.
- `res` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Leading and Trailing Zeros Removal**:
   - The list `a` is described as having all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed. This means that if `a` originally contained any zeros at the beginning or end, they have been removed.
   - For example, if `a` was originally `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0]`, after removing leading and trailing zeros, `a` would be `[1, 2, 3]`.

2. **Content of `a`**:
   - Since `a` is a list of integers with leading and trailing zeros removed, the exact content of `a` depends on the original list before the zeros were removed.
   - However, the precondition does not provide the original list, so we can only describe the content of `a` based on the given information.

### Output:
The `print(a)` statement will print the list `a` after all leading and trailing zeros have been removed. The exact content of `a` is not specified in the initial state, but it will be a list of integers with no leading or trailing zeros.

Output: **a (where a is a list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed)**
