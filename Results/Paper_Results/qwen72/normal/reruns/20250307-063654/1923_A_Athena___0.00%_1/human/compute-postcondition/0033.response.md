Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`, and `i` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`)**

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
