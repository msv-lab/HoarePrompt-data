Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them. The logic in the program is flawed because it only counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list, which does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of moves required.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
The expected output is `2`, as you need to move the chips to form a single block. However, the program will output `3` because it counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Identify the range of the ribbon that contains all the chips (i.e., the first and last positions of the chips).
2. Count the number of free cells (zeros) within this range.
3. The minimum number of operations required is the number of free cells within this range, as you can move each chip to the left to fill these free cells.

The provided program does not implement this logic correctly, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
