Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `t` is updated to `t - 1`.
3. `n` is an input integer.
4. `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed.
5. `res` is 0.
6. `i` is the last index of the updated list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1` if `a` is not empty, or `i` is undefined if `a` is empty).

### Code Snippet:
```
print(a)
```

### Analysis:
- The list `a` is described as a non-empty list with all leading and trailing zeros removed.
- Since `a` is non-empty, it means there is at least one element in the list that is not zero.
- The exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, but we know that `a` is a list with no leading or trailing zeros.

### Output:
The `print(a)` statement will print the list `a` after all leading and trailing zeros have been removed.

Output: **a (where a is a non-empty list with all leading and trailing zeros removed)**
