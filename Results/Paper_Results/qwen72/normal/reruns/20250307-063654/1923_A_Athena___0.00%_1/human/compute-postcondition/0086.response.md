The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the list `a` and the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 2 elements, `res` is 0, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is 0, `res` is set to 1.**
