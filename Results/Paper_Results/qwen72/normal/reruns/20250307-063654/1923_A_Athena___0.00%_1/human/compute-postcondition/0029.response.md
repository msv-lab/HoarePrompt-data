Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `res` is 3 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element is 0. Otherwise, `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, and 1 if the first element of `a` is not 0, provided that the third element of `a` is 0. If the third element of `a` is not 0, `res` remains as it was initially (2 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element is 0, 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, and 0 if the first element of `a` is not 0).***
