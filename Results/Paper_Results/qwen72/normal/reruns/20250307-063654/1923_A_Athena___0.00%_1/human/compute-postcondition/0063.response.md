The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after the decrement.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`, `i` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`)**

After the adjustment:
