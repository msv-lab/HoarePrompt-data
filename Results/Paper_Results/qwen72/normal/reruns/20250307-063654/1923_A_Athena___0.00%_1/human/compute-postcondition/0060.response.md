Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2. If `a[2]` is 0, `res` is 2 if `a[1]` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1. If `a[2]` is not 0, `res` remains 1 if `a[1]` is 0, otherwise `res` remains 0.***
