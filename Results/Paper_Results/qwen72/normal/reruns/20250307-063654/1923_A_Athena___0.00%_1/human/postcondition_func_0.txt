The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers 0 or 1. The function removes all leading and trailing zeros from `a`, then counts the number of zeros remaining in the list. It prints the modified list `a` and the count of zeros for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
