Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current element `a[i]` is 0.**

The value of `res` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
