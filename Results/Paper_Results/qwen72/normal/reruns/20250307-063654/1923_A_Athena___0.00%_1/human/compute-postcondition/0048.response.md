Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and the last element of `a` is now removed, `res` is 0, `i` is the new last index of the updated list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 2` if the list had more than one element before the pop, or `i` is undefined if the list had only one element before the pop).**
