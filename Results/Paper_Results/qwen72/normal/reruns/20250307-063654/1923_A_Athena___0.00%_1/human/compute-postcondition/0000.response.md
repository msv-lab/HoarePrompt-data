Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is either 0 or 1, representing whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). At least one cell in each test case contains a chip. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and has been set to the value provided by the user input.**
