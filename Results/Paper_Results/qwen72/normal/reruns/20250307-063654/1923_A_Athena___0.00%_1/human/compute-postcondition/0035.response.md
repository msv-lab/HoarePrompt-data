Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 0, `i` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`), and `a` is updated to a new list of integers based on the input.**
