Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and the last element of `a` is 0 (except the last element which has been removed), `res` is 0, `i` is the last index of the updated list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`)**. 

The last element of `a` (which was 0) has been removed, so the new last element of `a` is the second-to-last element from the initial state. The value of `i` is now one less than its initial value, as it is the last index of the updated list `a`.
