The variables in the loop head are `a` and the condition `a[0] == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be a non-empty list and its first element must be 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `a` must now have a first element that is 0, and it must still be non-empty.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed and the new first element is 0, `res` is 0**
