Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have all trailing zeros removed, in addition to the leading zeros that were already removed. The variable `t` remains greater than 0, `n` remains the input integer, and `res` remains 0, as these variables are not modified within the loop.
