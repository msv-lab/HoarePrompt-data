The first element of the list `a` is removed. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed and the new first element is 0, after executing `a.pop(0)`, the list `a` will have its new first element removed, and the next element in the list will become the new first element. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `res` are not affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element removed, `res` is 0**
