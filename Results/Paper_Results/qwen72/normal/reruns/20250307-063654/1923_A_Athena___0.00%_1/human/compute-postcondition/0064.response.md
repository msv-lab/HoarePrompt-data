Output State: **`t` is greater than 1 and now `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`, `i` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `len(a) - 1`)**

The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
