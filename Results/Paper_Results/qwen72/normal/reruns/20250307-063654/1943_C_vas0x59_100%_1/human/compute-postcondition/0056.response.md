Output State: **The loop will continue appending values to `path_ba` until it encounters a value of `-1` in the `previous` list. At the end of the loop, `path_ba` will contain the sequence of vertices that form the path from `b` to the starting vertex, with the last element being `-1`. The variable `n` will be the last value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` before the loop breaks, which is `-1`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`) will remain unchanged. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (an integer). `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` (an integer).**
