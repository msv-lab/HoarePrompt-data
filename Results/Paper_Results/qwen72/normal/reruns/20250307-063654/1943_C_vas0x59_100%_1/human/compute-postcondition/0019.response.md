Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the `u`-th list contains the value `v` and the `v`-th list in `u2vs` now contains an additional value `u - 2` and `u`, `_` is 2, `u` and `v` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `u` is now `u - 1`, `v` is now `v - 1`, and the `v`-th list in `u2vs` now contains an additional value `u - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is an integer greater than 3.
- The list `u2vs` is updated such that the `v`-th list (after `v` is updated to `v - 1`) now contains an additional value `u - 1`.
- The value of `_` remains 2.
- The values of `u` and `v` are updated to the values provided by the user input, and then `u` is set to `u - 1` and `v` is set to `v - 1`.
- The `u`-th list in `u2vs` (after `u` is updated to `u - 1`) already contains the value `v` (after `v` is updated to `v - 1`).
- The `v`-th list in `u2vs` (after `v` is updated to `v - 1`) now contains an additional value `u - 1`.
