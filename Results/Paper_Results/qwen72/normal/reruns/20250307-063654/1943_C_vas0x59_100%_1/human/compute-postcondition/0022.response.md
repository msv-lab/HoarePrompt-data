Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `u` and `v` are the last input values, each decremented by 1, `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from vertex 0, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
