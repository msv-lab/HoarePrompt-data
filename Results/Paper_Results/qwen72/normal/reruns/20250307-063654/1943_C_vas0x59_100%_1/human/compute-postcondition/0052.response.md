Output State: **`i` is 2, `ci` is at least 2, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length of at least 1, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`, `c` is the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.**

The value of `i` remains 2, `ci` is still at least 2, `path_ba` is still a list with an odd length of at least 1, and `n` is still -1. The list `ops` now contains the additional tuple `(c, 2)`, where `c` is the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.
