Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, `_` is `n - 2`, and the values of `u` and `v` are the last input values, each decremented by 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `n - 1` iterations, the following conditions hold true:
- The variable `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1, as it was in the initial state.
- The list `u2vs` now contains `n` lists, where each list at index `i` (representing vertex `i + 1`) contains the indices of the vertices that are connected to vertex `i + 1` in the tree. These indices are adjusted by subtracting 1 from the original input values.
- The loop counter `_` is equal to `n - 2`, indicating that the loop has completed `n - 1` iterations.
- The variables `u` and `v` are the last input values provided by the user, each decremented by 1. These values represent the last edge added to the tree.
