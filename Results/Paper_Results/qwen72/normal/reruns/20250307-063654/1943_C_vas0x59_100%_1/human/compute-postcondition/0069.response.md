Postcondition: **`path_ba` is a list containing the sequence of vertices that form the path from `b` to the starting vertex, with the last element being `-1`. The variable `n` is `-1`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`) remain unchanged. `ops` is a list that, if `len(path_ba)` is odd, contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `ci` is the integer division of `len(path_ba)` by 2 and `c` is the vertex at index `ci` in `path_ba`. If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the maximum value of `i` that is less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`, where `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.**
