The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ci`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `ci + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `ci` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `ci` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.

- `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
- `ci` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `ci` is at least 2, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length of at least 1, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`, `c` is the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.**
