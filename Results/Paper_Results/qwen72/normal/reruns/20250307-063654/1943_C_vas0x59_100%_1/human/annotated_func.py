#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of integers `l` and returns the index of the largest integer in the list. After the function concludes, the list `l` remains unchanged, and the user receives the index of the largest integer in the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are provided for the function `func_2`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and the subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree. The values of `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 <= u, v <= n and u â‰  v.

The variable `n` will be the last value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` before the loop breaks, which is `-1`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`) will remain unchanged.

    #State: `path_ba` is a list containing the sequence of vertices that form the path from `b` to the starting vertex, with the last element being `-1`. The variable `n` is `-1`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`) remain unchanged. `ops` is a list that, if `len(path_ba)` is odd, contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `ci` is the integer division of `len(path_ba)` by 2 and `c` is the vertex at index `ci` in `path_ba`. If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the maximum value of `i` that is less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`, where `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.

    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ops))` statement will print the length of the `ops` list.
    #   - The length of `ops` depends on whether `L` is odd or even.
    #
    #Let's summarize the possible outputs:
    #
    #- If `L` is odd, `len(ops) = L // 2 + 1`.
    #- If `L` is even, `len(ops) = 2 * (L // 2 // 2)`.
    #
    #Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ops)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated length of `ops`.
    #
    #Output:
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [c + 1] [i] for each tuple (c, i) in `ops` (where `c` is a vertex in `path_ba` and `i` is an index based on the length of `path_ba` and the conditions described)
    return None
    #The program returns `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads from the standard input to construct a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from vertex 0 to find a vertex `a` and another BFS from vertex `a` to find a vertex `b`. The function constructs a path from `b` to the starting vertex. Depending on the length of this path, it generates a list of operations `ops` and prints the length of `ops`. Finally, it prints each operation in a specific format and returns `None`. The function does not modify any global state or input parameters.
