Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the `u`-th list contains the value `v` and the `v`-th list in `u2vs` now contains an additional value `u - 2` and `u`, `_` is 2, `u` and `v` are updated to the values provided by the user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `u` and `v`.
- The values of `n`, `u2vs`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The new values of `u` and `v` are determined by the user input.
