No input parameters are provided for the function `func_2`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and the subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree. The values of `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 <= u, v <= n and u â‰  v.
