Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the `u`-th list now contains the value `v`, `_` is 1, `u` is `u - 2`, `v` is `v - 2`, and the `v`-th list in `u2vs` now contains an additional value `u - 2`. `u` and `v` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is decremented by 1, so `v` is now `v - 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
