Postcondition: ***`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and `n`. If `n` is -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `u2vs` remains a list of `n` lists, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `u` and `v` are the last input values, each decremented by 1, `d` is the first value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.***
