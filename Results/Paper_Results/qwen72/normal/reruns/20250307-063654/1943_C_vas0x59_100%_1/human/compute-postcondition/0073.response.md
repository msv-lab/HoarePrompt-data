The function `func_2` does not accept any input parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input. The first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree. The subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree, where each `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 <= u, v <= n and u â‰  v. After processing this input, the function returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of vertices `n` and the edges of a tree from the standard input, and then processes this information. It does not return any value.**
