The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `range(n - 1)`. For the loop to execute, the expression `range(n - 1)` must generate at least one value. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which implies that `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `_` is 0**
