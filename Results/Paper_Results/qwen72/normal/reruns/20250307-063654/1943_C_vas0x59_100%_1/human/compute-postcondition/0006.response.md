Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the `u`-th list now contains the value `v`, `_` is 0, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is `v - 1`**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the list at index `u` in `u2vs`. Since `u` is `u - 1` and `v` is `v - 1`, the `u`-th list in `u2vs` now contains the value `v`. The other variables remain unchanged.
