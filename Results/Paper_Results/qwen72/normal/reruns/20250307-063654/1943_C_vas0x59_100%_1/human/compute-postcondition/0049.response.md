The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `ci`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `ci + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `ci` is at least 0

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1
- `ci` must still be at least 0, but since `i` is now 1, `ci` must be at least 1 for the loop to continue executing.

The other variables (`path_ba`, `n`, `ops`, and `c`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is at least 1, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length of at least 1, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, 0)`, `c` is the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.**
