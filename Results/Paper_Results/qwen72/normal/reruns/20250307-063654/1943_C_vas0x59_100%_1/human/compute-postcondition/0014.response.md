The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and the current value of `_`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than 2.
- `_` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `_` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `n - 1` must be greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n - 1` must be greater than 2, which means `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the `u`-th list contains the value `v` and the `v`-th list in `u2vs` now contains an additional value `u - 2` and `u`, `_` is 2, `u` is `u - 2`, `v` is `v - 2`**
