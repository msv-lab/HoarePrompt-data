Output State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is at least 1, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length of at least 1, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`, `c` is the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.**

The code appends the tuple `(c, 1)` to the list `ops`, which initially contains the tuple `(c, 0)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
