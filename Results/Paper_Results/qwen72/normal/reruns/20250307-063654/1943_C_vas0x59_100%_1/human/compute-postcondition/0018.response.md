Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the `u`-th list contains the value `v` and the `v`-th list in `u2vs` now contains an additional value `u - 2` and `u`, `_` is 2, `u` and `v` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `u` is now `u - 1`, `v` is now `v - 1`, and the `u`-th list in `u2vs` now contains an additional value `v`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where `n` is an integer greater than 3.
- The `u`-th list in `u2vs` initially contains the value `v`.
- The `v`-th list in `u2vs` contains an additional value `u - 2` and `u`.
- The variables `u` and `v` are updated to the values provided by the user input, and then `u` is set to `u - 1` and `v` is set to `v - 1`.
- The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value `v` to the `u`-th list in `u2vs`.
- Therefore, the `u`-th list in `u2vs` now contains an additional value `v`, in addition to the value it already had.
- All other information from the initial state remains valid.
