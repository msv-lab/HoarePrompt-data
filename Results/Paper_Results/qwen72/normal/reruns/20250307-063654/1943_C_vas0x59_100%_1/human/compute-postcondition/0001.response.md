Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and the subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree. The values of `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 <= u, v <= n and u â‰  v. `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list containing `n` empty lists. Each empty list corresponds to a vertex in the tree, and will later be used to store the vertices connected to it by edges. The values of `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
