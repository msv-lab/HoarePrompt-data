To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the sequence of vertices that form the path from `b` to the starting vertex, with the last element being `-1`.
- `n` is `-1`.
- `ops` is a list that depends on the length of `path_ba`:
  - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `ci` is the integer division of `len(path_ba)` by 2 and `c` is the vertex at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
  - If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the maximum value of `i` that is less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`, where `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - Let's assume `path_ba` has a specific length, say `L = len(path_ba)`.
   - The last element of `path_ba` is `-1`, so the actual path vertices are from index 0 to `L-2`.

2. **Construct `ops` Based on the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - If `L` is odd:
     - `ci` is `L // 2`.
     - `ops` will contain tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `c` is the vertex at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
   - If `L` is even:
     - `ci2` is `L // 2`.
     - `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.
     - `ops` will contain tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the maximum value of `i` that is less than `L - ci1`.

3. **Apply the `map` Function**:
   - The `map` function applies the lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` to each tuple in `ops`.
   - For each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops`, the lambda function will produce a string `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.

4. **Print the Result**:
   - The `print` function will print each string produced by the `map` function, separated by a newline (`\n`).

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider two examples to illustrate the output:

#### Example 1: `path_ba` is `[1, 2, 3, -1]` (Even Length)
- `L = 4` (even).
- `ci2 = 4 // 2 = 2`.
- `ci1 = 2 - 1 = 1`.
- `ops` will contain tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the maximum value of `i` that is less than `4 - 1 = 3`.
  - `i = 1`: `c1 = path_ba[1] = 2`, `c2 = path_ba[2] = 3`.
  - `ops = [(2, 1), (3, 1)]`.
- Applying the lambda function:
  - For `(2, 1)`: `f'{2 + 1} {1}'` -> `'3 1'`.
  - For `(3, 1)`: `f'{3 + 1} {1}'` -> `'4 1'`.
- Output:
  ```
  3 1
  4 1
  ```

#### Example 2: `path_ba` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, -1]` (Odd Length)
- `L = 5` (odd).
- `ci = 5 // 2 = 2`.
- `ops` will contain tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, `(c, 2)` where `c` is the vertex at index `2` in `path_ba`.
  - `c = path_ba[2] = 3`.
  - `ops = [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)]`.
- Applying the lambda function:
  - For `(3, 0)`: `f'{3 + 1} {0}'` -> `'4 0'`.
  - For `(3, 1)`: `f'{3 + 1} {1}'` -> `'4 1'`.
  - For `(3, 2)`: `f'{3 + 1} {2}'` -> `'4 2'`.
- Output:
  ```
  4 0
  4 1
  4 2
  ```

### General Output:
Based on the initial state and the logic of the code, the output will depend on the length of `path_ba` and the specific values in `path_ba`. However, the format of the output will always be a series of strings, each containing two integers separated by a space, where the first integer is the vertex value plus 1, and the second integer is the index value.

Output: **[c + 1] [i] for each tuple (c, i) in `ops` (where `c` is a vertex in `path_ba` and `i` is an index based on the length of `path_ba` and the conditions described)**
