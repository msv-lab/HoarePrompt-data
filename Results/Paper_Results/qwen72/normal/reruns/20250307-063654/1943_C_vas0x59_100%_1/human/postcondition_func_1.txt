The function `func_2` reads from the standard input to construct a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from vertex 0 to find a vertex `a` and another BFS from vertex `a` to find a vertex `b`. The function constructs a path from `b` to the starting vertex. Depending on the length of this path, it generates a list of operations `ops` and prints the length of `ops`. Finally, it prints each operation in a specific format and returns `None`. The function does not modify any global state or input parameters.
