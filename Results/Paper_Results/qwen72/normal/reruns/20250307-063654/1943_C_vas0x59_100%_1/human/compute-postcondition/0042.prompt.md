Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `u` and `v` are the last input values, each decremented by 1, `d` is the first value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. If `n` is -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `u` and `v` are the last input values, each decremented by 1, `d` is the first value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values of `b` and `n`, and `n` has been appended to `path_ba`. If `n` is -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `u2vs` remains a list of `n` lists, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `u` and `v` are the last input values, each decremented by 1, `d` is the first value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values of `b` and `n`, and `n` has been appended to `path_ba` again. If `n` is -1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `u2vs` remains a list of `n` lists, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `u` and `v` are the last input values, each decremented by 1, `d` is the first value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
