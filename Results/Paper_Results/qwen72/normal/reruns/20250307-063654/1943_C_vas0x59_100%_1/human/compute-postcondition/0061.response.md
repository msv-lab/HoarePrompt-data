Output State: **`i` is 1, `path_ba` must have at least 4 elements, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (an integer), `ops` contains the tuple `(ci1, 1)` and `(ci2, 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- `path_ba` still must have at least 4 elements.
- `ci1` is still `ci2 - 1`, where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (an integer).
- The list `ops` now contains the tuple `(ci1, 1)` and the new tuple `(ci2, 1)` after the `append` operation.
