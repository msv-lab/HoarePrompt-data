You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are provided for the function `func_2`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and the subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree. The values of `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 <= u, v <= n and u ≠ v.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, `_` is `n - 2`, and the values of `u` and `v` are the last input values, each decremented by 1.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: The loop will continue appending values to `path_ba` until it encounters a value of `-1` in the `previous` list. At the end of the loop, `path_ba` will contain the sequence of vertices that form the path from `b` to the starting vertex, with the last element being `-1`. The variable `n` will be the last value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` before the loop breaks, which is `-1`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`) will remain unchanged.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: `i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length of at least 1, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, `c` is the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: `i` reaches the maximum value such that `i < len(path_ba) - ci1` and is odd, `path_ba` contains the sequence of vertices from `b` to the starting vertex with the last element being `-1`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (an integer), `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the maximum value of `i` that satisfies the loop condition.
    #State: `path_ba` is a list containing the sequence of vertices that form the path from `b` to the starting vertex, with the last element being `-1`. The variable `n` is `-1`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`) remain unchanged. `ops` is a list that, if `len(path_ba)` is odd, contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `ci` is the integer division of `len(path_ba)` by 2 and `c` is the vertex at index `ci` in `path_ba`. If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the maximum value of `i` that is less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`, where `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ops))` statement will print the length of the `ops` list.
    #   - The length of `ops` depends on whether `L` is odd or even.
    #
    #Let's summarize the possible outputs:
    #
    #- If `L` is odd, `len(ops) = L // 2 + 1`.
    #- If `L` is even, `len(ops) = 2 * (L // 2 // 2)`.
    #
    #Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ops)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated length of `ops`.
    #
    #Output:
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [c + 1] [i] for each tuple (c, i) in `ops` (where `c` is a vertex in `path_ba` and `i` is an index based on the length of `path_ba` and the conditions described)
    return None
    #The program returns `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads the number of vertices `n` and the edges of a tree from the standard input, and then processes this information. It does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `None`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
