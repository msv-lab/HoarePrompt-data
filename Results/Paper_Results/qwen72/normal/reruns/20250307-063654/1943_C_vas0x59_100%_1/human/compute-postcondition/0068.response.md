Output State: **`i` reaches the maximum value such that `i < len(path_ba) - ci1` and is odd, `path_ba` contains the sequence of vertices from `b` to the starting vertex with the last element being `-1`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (an integer), `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the maximum value of `i` that satisfies the loop condition.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations:
- The variable `i` reaches the highest odd number that is less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.
- The list `path_ba` remains unchanged and contains the sequence of vertices from `b` to the starting vertex, ending with `-1`.
- `ci1` is still `ci2 - 1`, where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
- The list `ops` will contain tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd `i` starting from 1 up to the maximum value of `i` that satisfies the loop condition. Each tuple represents the value of `c1` and `c2` at the respective odd index `i` in the loop.
