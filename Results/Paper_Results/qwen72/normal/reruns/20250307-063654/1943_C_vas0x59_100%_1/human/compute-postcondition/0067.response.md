Output State: **`i` is 5, `path_ba` must have at least 7 elements, `ci1` is 2, `ci2` is 3, `ops` contains the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(ci2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`**

The value of `i` remains 5, `path_ba` still must have at least 7 elements, `ci1` is still 2, and `ci2` is still 3. The list `ops` now includes an additional tuple `(c2, 5)`, making the full list of tuples in `ops` as `(ci1, 1)`, `(ci2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`.
