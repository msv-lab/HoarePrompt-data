Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will continue appending values to `path_ba` until it encounters a value of `-1` in the `previous` list. At the end of the loop, `path_ba` will contain the sequence of vertices that form the path from `b` to the starting vertex, with the last element being `-1`. The variable `n` will be the last value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` before the loop breaks, which is `-1`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`) will remain unchanged. `ops` is an empty list. Additionally, the length of `path_ba` is an odd number. `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. `c` is the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `ci` is at least 0, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length of at least 1, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, 0)`, `c` is the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `ci` is at least 1, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length of at least 1, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`, `c` is the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `ci` is at least 2, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length of at least 1, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`, `c` is the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
