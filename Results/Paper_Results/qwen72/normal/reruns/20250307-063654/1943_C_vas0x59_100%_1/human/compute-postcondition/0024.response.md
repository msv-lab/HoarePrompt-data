Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `u` and `v` are the last input values, each decremented by 1, `d` is the first value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs(a)` function, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`.
- The value of `d` is the first value returned by the `bfs(a)` function.
- The value of `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, where `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from vertex 0.
- The value of `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs(a)` function.
- All other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
