Output State: **`i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length of at least 1, `n` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, `c` is the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `i` will have reached the value `ci + 1`, which is one more than the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
- The variable `ci` will still be the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
- The list `path_ba` will remain unchanged and will still have an odd length of at least 1.
- The variable `n` will still be -1.
- The list `ops` will contain tuples where the first element is `c` and the second element is each integer from 0 to `ci` inclusive.
- The variable `c` will still be the vertex at the index `ci` in `path_ba`.
