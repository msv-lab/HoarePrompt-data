Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the `u`-th list now contains the value `v`, `_` is 0, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, and the `v`-th list in `u2vs` now contains an additional value `u - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` adds the value `u - 1` to the `v`-th list in `u2vs`.
- The initial state specifies that `u` is `u - 1` and `v` is `v - 1`, so the value being appended is `u - 1`.
- The other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `_`) remain unchanged.
- The updated state reflects that the `v`-th list in `u2vs` now includes an additional element, which is `u - 1`.
