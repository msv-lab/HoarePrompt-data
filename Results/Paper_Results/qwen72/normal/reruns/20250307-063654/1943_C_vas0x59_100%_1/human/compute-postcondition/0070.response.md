To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, let's break down the precondition and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the sequence of vertices that form the path from `b` to the starting vertex, with the last element being `-1`.
   - `n` is `-1`.
   - The other variables (`u2vs`, `u`, `v`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, `b`) remain unchanged.
   - `ops` is a list that depends on the length of `path_ba`.

2. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`:**
   - Let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `L`.
   - The last element of `path_ba` is `-1`, so `L` is at least 1.

3. **Construct `ops` Based on the Length of `path_ba`:**
   - If `L` (the length of `path_ba`) is odd:
     - `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)` where `ci` is the integer division of `L` by 2.
     - For example, if `L = 5`, then `ci = 5 // 2 = 2`, and `ops` will contain tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`.
     - The number of tuples in `ops` will be `ci + 1`.
   - If `L` is even:
     - `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the maximum value of `i` that is less than `L - ci1`, where `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
     - For example, if `L = 6`, then `ci2 = 6 // 2 = 3` and `ci1 = 3 - 1 = 2`.
     - The tuples will be `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`.
     - The number of tuples in `ops` will be `2 * (ci2 // 2)`.

4. **Calculate the Number of Tuples in `ops`:**
   - If `L` is odd, the number of tuples in `ops` is `L // 2 + 1`.
   - If `L` is even, the number of tuples in `ops` is `2 * (L // 2 // 2)`.

5. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print(len(ops))` statement will print the length of the `ops` list.
   - The length of `ops` depends on whether `L` is odd or even.

Let's summarize the possible outputs:

- If `L` is odd, `len(ops) = L // 2 + 1`.
- If `L` is even, `len(ops) = 2 * (L // 2 // 2)`.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ops)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated length of `ops`.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is the length of the list `ops` constructed based on the length of `path_ba` as described in the precondition)**
