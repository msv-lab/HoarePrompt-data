The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `_` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `_` will be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue, specifically `n` must be greater than 2 (since `_` is now 1 and the loop condition is `_ < n - 1`).

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the `u`-th list now contains the value `v`, `_` is 1, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, and the `v`-th list in `u2vs` now contains an additional value `u - 1`.**
