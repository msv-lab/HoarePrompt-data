Output State: **`i` is 3, `path_ba` must have at least 5 elements, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (an integer), `ops` contains the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(ci2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- `path_ba` still must have at least 5 elements.
- `ci1` is still `ci2 - 1`, where `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
- The list `ops` is updated to include the new tuple `(c2, 3)`. Therefore, `ops` now contains the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(ci2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`.
