Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements provided by the user, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the number of times `t1` was greater than or equal to `t2`, `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `c` is now a list of integers provided by the user.**

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged except for `c`, which is now a list of integers provided by the user. The list `c` was previously described as a sorted list of integers in descending order, but now it is updated to the list of integers provided by the user. The other variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
