Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` remains unchanged and `t2` remains greater than `t1`. If `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1. `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.**

In natural language: The value of `i` is increased by 1. The other variables (`a`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `j`, and `ans`) remain unchanged, but the condition that `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2` still holds. The condition that if `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` remains unchanged, and if `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1, also remains valid.
