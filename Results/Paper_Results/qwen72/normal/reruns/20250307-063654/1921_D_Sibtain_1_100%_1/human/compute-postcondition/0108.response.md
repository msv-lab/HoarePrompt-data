Output State: **`a` must have at least 2 elements, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `t2`. If `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `t1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])` updates the value of `t1` to the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.
- The values of `a`, `k`, `t2`, `i`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `j` and `ans` based on the comparison between `t2` and `t1` is still valid but has not been triggered by this code snippet.
