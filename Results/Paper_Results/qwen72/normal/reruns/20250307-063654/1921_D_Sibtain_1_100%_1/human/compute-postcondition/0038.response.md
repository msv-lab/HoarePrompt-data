Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is the sum of the maximum values between `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(a)`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the length of the list `a`.
- After all iterations, the variable `k` will be `len(a) - 1` because the loop index `k` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(a) - 1`.
- The variable `i` will be `len(a)` because `i` is incremented in each iteration unless `t2` is greater than `t1`, in which case `j` is incremented.
- The variable `j` will also be `len(a)` because `j` is incremented in each iteration where `t2` is greater than `t1`, and it starts from 1.
- The variable `ans` will be the sum of the maximum values between `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` for each iteration of the loop.
- The other variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
