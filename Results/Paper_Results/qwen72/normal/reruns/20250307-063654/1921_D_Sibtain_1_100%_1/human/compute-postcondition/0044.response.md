Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1.
- `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `c` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum values between `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` for each iteration of the loop.
- `k` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `i` is `len(a)`.
- `j` is `len(a)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(0)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.
- The value `0` is a constant integer.

### Output:
The code prints the integer `0`.
Output: **0**
