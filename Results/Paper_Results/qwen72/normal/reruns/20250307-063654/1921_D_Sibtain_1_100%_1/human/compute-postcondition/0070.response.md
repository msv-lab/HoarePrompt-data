Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the previous value of `ans`, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])` updates the value of `t1` to the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.
- Since `i` is 1, `t1` is now the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `c[1]`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The value of `t2` is not affected by this code snippet, so it remains the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, with `j` being 2.
- The initial conditions for `i` and `j` are still valid: `i` is 1 and `j` is 2.
