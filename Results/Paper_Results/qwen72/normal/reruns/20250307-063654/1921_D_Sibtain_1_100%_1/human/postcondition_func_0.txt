The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` and lists of integers `a` and `c`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of `a` equal to the elements of `c` by either increasing or decreasing the elements of `a`. The function prints the result for each test case. If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` after sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order.
