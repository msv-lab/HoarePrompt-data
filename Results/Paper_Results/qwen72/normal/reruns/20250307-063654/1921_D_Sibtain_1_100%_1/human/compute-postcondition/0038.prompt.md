Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order input by the user, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, and if the list `a` contains exactly one unique integer and the list `c` contains only one unique integer, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program does not continue to the next iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order input by the user, `ans` is the maximum value between `t1` and `t2`, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the second-to-last elements of `a` and `c`. If `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order input by the user, `ans` is the maximum value between `abs(a[1] - c[1])` and `t2` plus `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is the maximum value between `abs(a[1] - c[1])` and `t2` plus `max(t1, t2)` and then `ans` is increased by `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is either 3 or 2, `j` is either 2 or 1, depending on whether `t2` is greater than `t1` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
