The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must have at least 2 elements, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i-1]` and `c[i-1]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `i` is increased by 1.
