Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1.
- `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user.
- If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal to each other, the loop continues to the next iteration with `ans` being the sum of the maximum values between `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` for each iteration of the loop.
- `k` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `i` is `len(a)`.
- `j` is `len(a)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: This is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
2. **List `c`**: This is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
3. **`a[0]`**: This is the smallest element in the list `a`.
4. **`max(c)`**: This is the largest element in the list `c` (since `c` is sorted in descending order, `max(c)` is `c[0]`).
5. **`min(c)`**: This is the smallest element in the list `c` (since `c` is sorted in descending order, `min(c)` is `c[len(c) - 1]`).

### Calculation:
- The expression `abs(a[0] - max(c))` calculates the absolute difference between the smallest element in `a` and the largest element in `c`.
- The expression `abs(a[0] - min(c))` calculates the absolute difference between the smallest element in `a` and the smallest element in `c`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the maximum of these two absolute differences.

Since the exact values of `a` and `c` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of these lists.

Output: **max(abs(a[0] - c[0]), abs(a[0] - c[len(c) - 1])) (where `a[0]` is the smallest element in the sorted list `a`, `c[0]` is the largest element in the sorted list `c`, and `c[len(c) - 1]` is the smallest element in the sorted list `c`)**
