Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the previous value of `ans`, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `c[1]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - 3]` and `c[len(c) - 3]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += max(t1, t2)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to its current value.
- The values of `t1` and `t2` are determined based on the conditions provided in the initial state.
- Since `t2` is greater than `t1`, `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to 3.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the previous value of `ans`.
