Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is increased by 1 and `t2` remains greater than `t1`. If `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1. `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.**

The code snippet `t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])` updates the value of `t1` to the absolute difference between the elements `a[i]` and `c[i]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is increased by 1 and `t2` remains greater than `t1`. If `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1. `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.**
