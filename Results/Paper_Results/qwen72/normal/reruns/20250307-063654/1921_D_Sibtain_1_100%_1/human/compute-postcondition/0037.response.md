Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is the maximum value between `abs(a[1] - c[1])` and `t2` plus `max(t1, t2)` and then `ans` is increased by `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is either 3 or 2, `j` is either 2 or 1, depending on whether `t2` is greater than `t1` or not.**
