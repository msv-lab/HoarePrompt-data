Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum values between `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(a)`**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `c` as a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 2 elements is replaced by a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `c` is a list of integers input by the user, which may or may not be sorted or in descending order.
