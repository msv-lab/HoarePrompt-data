Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[-1]` and `c[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet calculates `t2` as the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`. Since `j` is 1, `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]` refer to the last elements of `a` and `c` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
