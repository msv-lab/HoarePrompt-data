You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5. a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        a.sort()
        
        c.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
            continue
        
        i, j, ans = 0, 1, 0
        
        for k in range(len(a)):
            t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
            t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
            if t2 > t1:
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
            ans += max(t1, t2)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `_` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the number of times `t1` was greater than or equal to `t2`, `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` and lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
