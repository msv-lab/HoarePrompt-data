Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order input by the user. The list `a` contains exactly one unique integer. If the list `a` contains only one unique integer and the list `c` contains only one unique integer, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program does not continue to the next iteration of the loop.** 

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged.
