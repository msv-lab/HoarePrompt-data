Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order input by the user, `ans` is the maximum value between `abs(a[1] - c[1])` and `t2` plus `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `max(t1, t2)` to its current value.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, and the conditions for `j` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans` is the sum of its previous value (which was the maximum value between `abs(a[1] - c[1])` and `t2`) and `max(t1, t2)`.
