Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order input by the user, `ans` is the maximum value between `abs(a[1] - c[1])` and `t2`, `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, if `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` calculates the absolute difference between the elements at the indices `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j` in the lists `a` and `c`, respectively, and assigns this value to `t2`.
- The value of `j` is either 1 or 2, depending on the initial conditions. If `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2; otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.
- The other variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`) remain unchanged, but `t2` is updated based on the new calculation.
