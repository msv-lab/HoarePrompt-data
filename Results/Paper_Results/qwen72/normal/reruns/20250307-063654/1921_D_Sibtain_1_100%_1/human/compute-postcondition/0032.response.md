Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order input by the user, `ans` is the maximum value between `abs(a[1] - c[1])` and `t2` plus `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])` updates the value of `t1` to `abs(a[2] - c[2])` because `i` is 2.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `t2`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, which is the absolute difference between the second elements of the lists `a` and `c`.
