Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is the sum of the maximum values between `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(a)`, `n` and `m` are now specific integers provided by the user.**
