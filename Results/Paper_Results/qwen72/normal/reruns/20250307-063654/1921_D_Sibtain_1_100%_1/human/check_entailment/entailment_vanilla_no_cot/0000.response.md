Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. The logic for selecting elements from the sorted `a` and `c` arrays to maximize the total difference `D` is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the optimal selection can be made by comparing the differences between the smallest and largest elements of `a` and `c` in a sequential manner. This approach does not guarantee the maximum possible total difference `D`.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the total difference `D`, Vasya should select the `n` largest or smallest elements from the sorted `c` array and pair them with the corresponding elements from the sorted `a` array. This can be done by sorting `a` and `c` and then selecting the `n` largest elements from `c` and pairing them with the smallest elements from `a`, or vice versa, to maximize the absolute differences.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        c.sort()
        
        # Calculate the maximum difference by pairing the smallest elements of a with the largest elements of c
        max_diff1 = sum(abs(a[i] - c[m - 1 - i]) for i in range(n))
        
        # Calculate the maximum difference by pairing the largest elements of a with the smallest elements of c
        max_diff2 = sum(abs(a[n - 1 - i] - c[i]) for i in range(n))
        
        # The maximum of the two strategies is the answer
        print(max(max_diff1, max_diff2))

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: Both `a` and `c` are sorted.
2. **Two Strategies**:
   - **Strategy 1**: Pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `c`.
   - **Strategy 2**: Pair the largest elements of `a` with the smallest elements of `c`.
3. **Maximize Difference**: The maximum of the two strategies is the answer.

This approach ensures that the total difference `D` is maximized for all test cases.
