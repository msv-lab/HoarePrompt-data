Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum total difference \( D \) between Petya's array \( a \) and Vasya's array \( c \). The program aims to achieve this by sorting \( a \) in ascending order and \( c \) in descending order. This approach is based on the idea that the maximum difference between two elements is achieved when one is the smallest and the other is the largest. By pairing the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( c \), and vice versa, the program maximizes the absolute differences.

However, there are a few issues in the program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Single Element Arrays**:
   - The program has a special case for when \( n = 1 \). It calculates the maximum difference between the single element of \( a \) and the maximum or minimum element of \( c \). This is correct, but the logic for \( n > 1 \) is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Pairing Logic**:
   - The program uses a loop to pair elements from \( a \) and \( c \), but the logic for choosing which element to pair is incorrect. It should always pair the smallest element of \( a \) with the largest element of \( c \) and the largest element of \( a \) with the smallest element of \( c \) to maximize the difference. The current logic does not always ensure this.

3. **Redundant Special Case**:
   - The special case where all elements in \( a \) and \( c \) are the same is unnecessary because the main logic should handle this correctly. If all elements are the same, the maximum difference will be zero, which is the correct result.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
