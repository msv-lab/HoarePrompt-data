Output State: **`a` must have at least 2 elements, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`.** 

The code snippet `t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` updates the value of `t2` to the absolute difference between the elements `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. The values of `a`, `k`, `t1`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
