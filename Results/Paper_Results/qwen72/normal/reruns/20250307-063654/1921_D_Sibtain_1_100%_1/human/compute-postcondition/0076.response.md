Output State: **_ is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the number of times `t1` was greater than or equal to `t2`, `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `_` remains 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n` and `m` remain the specific integers provided by the user, as they are not modified within the loop.
- The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `c` remains a sorted list of integers in descending order, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences (`max(t1, t2)`) calculated in each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `k` is `len(a) - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `len(a)` iterations.
- The variable `i` is the number of times `t1` was greater than or equal to `t2` during the loop's execution.
- The variable `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` during the loop's execution, plus 1 (since `j` starts at 1 and increments each time `t2` is greater).
