Output State: **`a` must have at least 2 elements, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. If `t2` > `t1`, `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.**
