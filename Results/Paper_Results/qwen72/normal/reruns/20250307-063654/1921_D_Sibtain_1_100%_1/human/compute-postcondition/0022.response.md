Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order input by the user, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `c`, `t2` is the absolute difference between the second-to-last elements of `a` and `c`. If `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.***
