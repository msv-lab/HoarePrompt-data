To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **_ is 1**: This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
2. **`n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user**: These variables are also not used in the print statement, so they do not affect the output.
3. **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements**: This means `a` is a list where the elements are in ascending order.
4. **`c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user**: This means `c` is a list where the elements are in descending order.
5. **`ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration**: This implies that for each pair of elements at the same index in `a` and `c`, we calculate the absolute difference, and then we take the maximum of these differences. This process is repeated for each iteration, and the results are summed up to get `ans`.
6. **`k` is `len(a) - 1**: This variable represents the last index of the list `a`.
7. **`i` is the number of times `t1` was greater than or equal to `t2`**: This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
8. **`j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1**: This variable is also not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

Given the above information, the `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `c` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration)**
