The only objects in the loop head are the variable `k` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a` and the value of `k`. If `k` is less than the length of `a`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `a` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `a` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`a` must have at least 2 elements, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `t2`. If `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `t1`.**
