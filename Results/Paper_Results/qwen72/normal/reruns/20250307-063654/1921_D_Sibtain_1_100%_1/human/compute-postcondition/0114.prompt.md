Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, if `a` and `c` are both lists with all elements being the same and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, or if `a` has only one element, then the values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `k` remain unchanged, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 1. Otherwise, if `a` has more than one element, the values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `k` remain as they were initially, `a` is now sorted in ascending order, `c` is now sorted in descending order, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` must have at least one element, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is increased by 1 and `t2` remains greater than `t1`. If `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1. `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` must have at least one element, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `t2`. If `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` must have at least 2 elements, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. If `t2` > `t1`, `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
