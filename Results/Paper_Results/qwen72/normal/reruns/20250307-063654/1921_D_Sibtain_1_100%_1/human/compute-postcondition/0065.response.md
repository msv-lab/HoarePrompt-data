Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2.**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
