Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t2` is updated to the absolute difference between the elements at the index `len(a) - j` in list `a` and the index `len(c) - j` in list `c`.
- The value of `j` is either 1 or 2, depending on the initial condition. If `t2` was greater than `t1`, `j` is 2; otherwise, `j` is 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
