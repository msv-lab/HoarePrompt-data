Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the number of times `t1` was greater than or equal to `t2`, `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The loop counter `_` will be `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variables `n` and `m` will hold the specific integers provided by the user for the last test case.
- The list `a` will be sorted in ascending order, and the list `c` will be sorted in descending order, both containing the integers provided by the user for the last test case.
- The variable `ans` will contain the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration of the loop for the last test case.
- The variable `k` will be `len(a) - 1`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list `a`.
- The variable `i` will be the number of times `t1` (the absolute difference between the smallest elements of `a` and `c`) was greater than or equal to `t2` (the absolute difference between the largest elements of `a` and `c`).
- The variable `j` will be the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1.
