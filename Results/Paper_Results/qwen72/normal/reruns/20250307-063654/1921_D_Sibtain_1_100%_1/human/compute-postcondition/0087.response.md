To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `a` and `c` are both lists.
- If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, the values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- Otherwise, `a` is sorted in ascending order, and `c` is sorted in descending order.
- `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**:
   - If `a` and `c` are the same lists (all elements are the same and the first elements are equal), then the values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged.
   - If `a` and `c` are not the same lists, then `a` is sorted in ascending order and `c` is sorted in descending order.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement**:
   - `a[0]`: The first element of list `a`.
   - `max(c)`: The maximum element of list `c`.
   - `min(c)`: The minimum element of list `c`.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - If `a` and `c` are the same lists, then `a[0]` is equal to `c[0]`, and `max(c)` and `min(c)` are the same as `a[0]` because all elements are the same.
     - Therefore, `abs(a[0] - max(c))` and `abs(a[0] - min(c))` will both be 0.
     - The `max` function will return 0.
   - If `a` and `c` are not the same lists, then:
     - `a` is sorted in ascending order, so `a[0]` is the smallest element of `a`.
     - `c` is sorted in descending order, so `max(c)` is the first element of `c` (which is the largest element of `c`), and `min(c)` is the last element of `c` (which is the smallest element of `c`).
     - The `print` statement will compute:
       - `abs(a[0] - max(c))`: The absolute difference between the smallest element of `a` and the largest element of `c`.
       - `abs(a[0] - min(c))`: The absolute difference between the smallest element of `a` and the smallest element of `c`.
     - The `max` function will return the larger of these two values.

### Final Output:
- If `a` and `c` are the same lists:
  - Output: **0**
- If `a` and `c` are not the same lists:
  - Output: **max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))) (where `a[0]` is the smallest element of `a`, `max(c)` is the largest element of `c`, and `min(c)` is the smallest element of `c`)**

Since the exact values of `a` and `c` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the conditions given.

Output: **max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))) (where `a[0]` is the smallest element of `a`, `max(c)` is the largest element of `c`, and `min(c)` is the smallest element of `c`)**
