To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the given code snippet).
   - `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0 (these variables are not used in the given code snippet).
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 2 elements.
   - `ans` is the sum of the maximum values between `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` for each iteration of the loop.
   - `k` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `i` is `len(a)`.
   - `j` is `len(a)`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
   - `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
   - `i` and `j` are both set to `len(a)`, which means they are equal to the length of the list `a`.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = len(a)` to `i = 1` (decrementing `i` by 1 each time).
   - For each iteration, the value of `ans` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(a[i-1] - c[i-1])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.
   - `j` is also decremented by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Detailed Calculation:**
   - In the first iteration, `i` is `len(a)` and `j` is `len(a)`.
     - `a[i-1]` is the last element of `a`.
     - `c[i-1]` is the first element of `c`.
     - `a[len(a) - j]` is the first element of `a`.
     - `c[len(c) - j]` is the last element of `c`.
   - The maximum value between `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[0])` and `abs(a[0] - c[len(c) - 1])` is added to `ans`.
   - In the second iteration, `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `j` is `len(a) - 1`.
     - `a[i-1]` is the second last element of `a`.
     - `c[i-1]` is the second element of `c`.
     - `a[len(a) - j]` is the second element of `a`.
     - `c[len(c) - j]` is the second last element of `c`.
   - The maximum value between `abs(a[len(a) - 2] - c[1])` and `abs(a[1] - c[len(c) - 2])` is added to `ans`.
   - This process continues until `i` and `j` both reach 1.

5. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` will be the sum of the maximum values of the differences between corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the lists `a` and `c` for each iteration of the loop.

Since the exact values of the elements in `a` and `c` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum values between `abs(a[i-1] - c[i-1])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` for each iteration of the loop, with `i` and `j` starting from `len(a)` and decrementing to 1)**
