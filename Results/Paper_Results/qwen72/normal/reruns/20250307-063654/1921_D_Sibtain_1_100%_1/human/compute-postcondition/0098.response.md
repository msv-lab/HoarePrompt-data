Postcondition: ***`a` must have at least one element, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is increased by 1 and `t2` remains greater than `t1`. If `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1.***
