Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the length of the array `c` is greater than the length of the array `a`. Specifically, the program uses the same index for both `a` and `c` when calculating the differences, which can lead to incorrect results if `c` is longer than `a`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 4
1 2 3
4 5 6 7
```

The program will sort `a` as `[1, 2, 3]` and `c` as `[7, 6, 5, 4]`. It will then calculate the differences using the indices `i` and `j` for both arrays, but it will only use the first three elements of `c` (i.e., `[7, 6, 5]`). The correct approach should consider all possible combinations of `n` elements from `c` to maximize the total difference `D`.

The correct approach would involve selecting the `n` largest elements from `c` and then pairing them with the smallest elements of `a` to maximize the difference. The current program does not ensure this, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
