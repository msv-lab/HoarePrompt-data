Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order input by the user, `ans` is the maximum value between `abs(a[1] - c[1])` and `t2`, `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is 2, if `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that if `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. Since `i` was initially 1 and is now 2, the condition for `j` remains the same.
