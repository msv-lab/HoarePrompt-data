Postcondition: **If `a` and `c` are both lists with all elements being the same and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, or if `a` has only one element, then the values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 1. Otherwise, if `a` has more than one element, the values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain as they were initially, `a` is now sorted in ascending order, `c` is now sorted in descending order, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.**
