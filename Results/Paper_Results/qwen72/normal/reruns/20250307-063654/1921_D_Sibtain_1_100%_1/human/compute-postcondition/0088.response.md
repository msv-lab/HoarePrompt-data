Output State: **The values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `a` and `c` are both lists with all elements being the same and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 1. Otherwise, the values of `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain as they were initially, `a` is now sorted in ascending order, `c` is now sorted in descending order, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
