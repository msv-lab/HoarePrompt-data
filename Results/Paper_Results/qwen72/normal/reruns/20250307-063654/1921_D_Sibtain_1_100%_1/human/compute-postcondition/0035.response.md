Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order input by the user, `ans` is the maximum value between `abs(a[1] - c[1])` and `t2` plus `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is 3, and `j` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `t2` is greater than `t1` or not.**
