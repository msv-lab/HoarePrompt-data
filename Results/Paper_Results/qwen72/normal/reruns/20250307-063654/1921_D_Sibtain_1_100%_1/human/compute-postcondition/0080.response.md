Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements provided by the user, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the number of times `t1` was greater than or equal to `t2`, `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- This changes the value of `a` to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The other variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this code snippet.
- The precondition that `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements is now satisfied by the new list provided by the user.
- The precondition that `int(input())` must be greater than 1 is still valid, but it does not affect the current state since the input is already provided for `a`.
- The output state reflects these changes and retains all other preconditions that are still valid.
