Output State: **If `_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, then `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `ans` is 0. The values of `k` and the conditions for the loop continue to be the same as in the initial state.**
