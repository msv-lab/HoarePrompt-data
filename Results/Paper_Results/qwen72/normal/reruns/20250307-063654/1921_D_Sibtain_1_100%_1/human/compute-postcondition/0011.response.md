Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0 (though these variables are not used in the code snippet).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order input by the user.
- The list `a` contains exactly one unique integer.
- If the list `a` contains only one unique integer and the list `c` contains only one unique integer, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program does not continue to the next iteration of the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - Since `a` contains exactly one unique integer, `a` must be a list with a single element, say `a = [x]`.

2. **List `c`**:
   - `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
   - If `c` contains only one unique integer, `c` must also be a list with a single element, say `c = [y]`.

3. **Condition**:
   - The condition states that if the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
   - Since `a` and `c` both contain exactly one unique integer and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, we have `x = y`.

4. **Expression in the `print` Statement**:
   - `a[0]` is the first element of `a`, which is `x`.
   - `max(c)` is the maximum element of `c`, which is `y` (since `c` is a list with a single element).
   - `min(c)` is the minimum element of `c`, which is also `y` (since `c` is a list with a single element).
   - The expression `abs(a[0] - max(c))` simplifies to `abs(x - y)`, which is `abs(x - x) = 0`.
   - The expression `abs(a[0] - min(c))` also simplifies to `abs(x - y)`, which is `abs(x - x) = 0`.
   - The `max` function will then return the maximum of `0` and `0`, which is `0`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the maximum of the two absolute differences, both of which are `0`.

Output: **0**
