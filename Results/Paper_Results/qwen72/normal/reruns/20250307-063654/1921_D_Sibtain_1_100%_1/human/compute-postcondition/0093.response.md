Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t2` is calculated as the absolute difference between the elements at the positions `len(a) - j` in `a` and `len(c) - j` in `c`.
- The values of `a`, `k`, and `t1` remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions are still valid: `a` must have at least one element, `k` is 0, and `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.
