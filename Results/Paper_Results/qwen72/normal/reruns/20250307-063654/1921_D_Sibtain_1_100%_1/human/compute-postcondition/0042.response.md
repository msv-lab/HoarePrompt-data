Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least 2 elements, `ans` is the sum of the maximum values between `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(a)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements. After the code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` is executed, `a` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The user input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and stored in the list `a`.
- The initial state also specifies that `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0. After the user provides specific values for `n` and `m`, these variables are now specific integers.
- The variables `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the code snippet provided, so their values remain as specified in the initial state.
