Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum values between `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(a)`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and immediately start the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
