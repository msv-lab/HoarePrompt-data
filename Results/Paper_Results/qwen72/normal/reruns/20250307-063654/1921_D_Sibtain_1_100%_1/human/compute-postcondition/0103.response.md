Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `j` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.** 

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the value of `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
