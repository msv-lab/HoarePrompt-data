The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must have at least 2 elements, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, and `j` is increased by 1.
