The value of `ans` is updated by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The other variables (`_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[-1]` and `c[-1]`. If `t2` > `t1`, `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**
