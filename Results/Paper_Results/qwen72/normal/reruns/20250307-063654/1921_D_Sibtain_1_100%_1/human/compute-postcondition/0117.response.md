The function `func` is described with certain parameter constraints but does not explicitly list the parameters in its definition. Based on the provided constraints, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m`, and lists `a_i` and `b_i` of integers. However, since the function definition does not specify these parameters, it is assumed that the function might accept them in a different form, such as a list of test cases or through some other means not shown in the function signature.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the lengths of the lists `a_i` and `b_i`.
- `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function is expected to process these inputs and produce an output. However, the specific output is not provided in the question. Assuming the function is designed to return some result based on the processing of these inputs, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` and lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
