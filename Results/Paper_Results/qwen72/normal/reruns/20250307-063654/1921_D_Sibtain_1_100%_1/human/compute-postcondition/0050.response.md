Output State: **If `_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `c` is now a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, then if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal to each other, the loop continues to the next iteration with `ans` being the sum of the maximum values between `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is `len(a)`, and `j` is `len(a)`. Otherwise, the loop continues with the same values for `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j`.** 

The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and immediately jump to the next iteration. The values of `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The conditions for the loop and the variables `a` and `c` also remain the same.
