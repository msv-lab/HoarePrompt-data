Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, and `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`; `i` is increased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while the other conditions and variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still has at least one element, `k` is still 0, `t1` is still the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, and `t2` is still the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, with `t2` being less than or equal to `t1`.
