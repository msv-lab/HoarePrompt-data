Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements provided by the user, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the number of times `t1` was greater than or equal to `t2`, `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `c` is now a list of integers provided by the user.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
