Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the previous value of `ans`, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. If `t2` > `t1`, `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 2.**
