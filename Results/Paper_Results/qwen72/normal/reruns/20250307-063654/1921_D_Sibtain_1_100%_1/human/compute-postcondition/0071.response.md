Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` and `m` are specific integers provided by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers in descending order provided by the user, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` and the previous value of `ans`, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` updates the value of `t2`.
- `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`, and `len(c)` is the length of the list `c`.
- `j` is 2, so `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j` are both specific indices in the lists `a` and `c`.
- `t2` is now the absolute difference between the element at index `len(a) - 2` in `a` and the element at index `len(c) - 2` in `c`.
- The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
