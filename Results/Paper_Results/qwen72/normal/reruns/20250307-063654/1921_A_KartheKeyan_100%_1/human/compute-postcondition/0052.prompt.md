Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord` (which are now undefined because `coord` is empty), `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord` (which are also now undefined because `coord` is empty).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(4):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    coord.append((x, y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` and `p2` are still undefined because `coord` now contains only one tuple.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` and `p2` are still undefined because `coord` now contains only one tuple.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` and `p2` are still undefined because `coord` now contains only one tuple.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
