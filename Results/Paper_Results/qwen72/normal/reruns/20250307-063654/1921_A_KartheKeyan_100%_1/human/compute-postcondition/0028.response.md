Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is undefined because `coord` does not contain at least two tuples, `p2` is undefined because `coord` does not contain at least four tuples.** 

The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers provided by the user. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
