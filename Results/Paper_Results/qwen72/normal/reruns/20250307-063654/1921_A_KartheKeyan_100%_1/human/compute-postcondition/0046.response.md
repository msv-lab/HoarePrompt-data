The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `4`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The range `4` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` and `p2` are still undefined because `coord` now contains only one tuple.**
