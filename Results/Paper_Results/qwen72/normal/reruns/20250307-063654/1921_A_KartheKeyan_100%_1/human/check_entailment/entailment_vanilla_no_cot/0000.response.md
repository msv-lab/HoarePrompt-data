Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the area of the square. Here are the issues:

1. **Sorting Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, but this does not guarantee that the points are in the correct order to form the sides of the square. Sorting by the default tuple order (first by x, then by y) can lead to incorrect pairings of points.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points (p1 and p2) and then takes the square root of each distance before multiplying them. This approach is flawed because the area of a square is the square of the length of one of its sides, not the product of two distances.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic used to calculate the area is incorrect. The correct way to find the area of a square given its corners is to find the distance between two adjacent corners and then square that distance.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Find the unique x and y coordinates.
- The side length of the square is the difference between the maximum and minimum x (or y) coordinates.
- The area of the square is the square of the side length.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        x_coords = []
        y_coords = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            x_coords.append(x)
            y_coords.append(y)
        
        # Find the unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set(x_coords))
        y_coords = sorted(set(y_coords))
        
        # The side length of the square
        side_length = x_coords[1] - x_coords[0]  # or y_coords[1] - y_coords[0]
        
        # The area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)
        n -= 1

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected program will correctly compute the area of the square for the given test cases.
