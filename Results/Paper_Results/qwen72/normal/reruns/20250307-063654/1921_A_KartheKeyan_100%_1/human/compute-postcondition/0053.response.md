Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` and `p2` are still undefined.**

The `coord` list is now sorted based on the tuples it contains, but the other variables remain unchanged. The sorting is done in lexicographical order, meaning it first sorts by the first element of the tuples, and if they are equal, it sorts by the second element. The values of `i`, `n`, `res`, `x`, and `y` remain the same, and `p1` and `p2` are still undefined.
