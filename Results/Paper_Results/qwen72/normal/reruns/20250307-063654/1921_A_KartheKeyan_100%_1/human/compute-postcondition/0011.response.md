The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the range `4`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The range `4` remains constant and does not change.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.**
