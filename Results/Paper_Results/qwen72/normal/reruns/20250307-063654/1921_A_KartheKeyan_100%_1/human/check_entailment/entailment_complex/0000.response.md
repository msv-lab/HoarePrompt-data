Reasoning:  
The program is intended to calculate the area of a square given its corner coordinates. However, there are several issues with the implementation that make it incorrect:

1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: The program sorts the list of coordinates. While this can help in some cases, it does not guarantee that the points will be in the correct order to form a square. The correct approach would be to determine the side length of the square by finding the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared Euclidean distances between specific pairs of coordinates (`p1` and `p2`). However, for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent points. The squared Euclidean distance is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the area by taking the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. This is incorrect because the area of a square is simply the side length squared. The correct approach would be to find the side length and then square it.

4. **Rounding**: The program rounds the result, which is unnecessary since the area should be an integer.

A correct implementation would involve:
- Finding the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates.
- Calculating the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x (or y) coordinates.
- Squaring the side length to get the area.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
