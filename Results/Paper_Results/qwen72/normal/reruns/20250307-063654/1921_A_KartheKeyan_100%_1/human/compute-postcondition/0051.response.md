Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` and `p2` are still undefined because `coord` now contains only one tuple.**

In natural language: The initial state is updated such that the list `coord` now contains three tuples, all of which are `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user. The other variables `i`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged, and `p1` and `p2` are still undefined because `coord` now contains only one tuple.
