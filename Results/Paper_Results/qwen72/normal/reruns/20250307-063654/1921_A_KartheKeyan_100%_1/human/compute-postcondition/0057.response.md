Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be a positive integer.
   - `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)`.
   - `res` is calculated as `math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.
   - `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.
   - `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
   - `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.

2. **Understanding the Calculation:**
   - `coord` is a sorted list of four tuples, so let's denote the tuples as `coord[0] = (x0, y0)`, `coord[1] = (x1, y1)`, `coord[2] = (x2, y2)`, and `coord[3] = (x3, y3)`.
   - `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first tuples: `p1 = x1 - x0`.
   - `p2` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the fourth and third tuples: `p2 = x3 - x2`.
   - `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`: `res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`.

3. **Rounding the Result:**
   - The `print(round(res))` statement will print the rounded value of `res`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `x0`, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`.
   - However, based on the given formula, the output will be the rounded value of the product of the square roots of the differences in the x-coordinates of the specified tuples.

Output: **round(res) (where res is the product of the square roots of the differences in the x-coordinates of the specified tuples in the sorted list `coord`)**
