Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, the new tuple `(x, y)`, and the additional new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.**

The code appends the new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`, which already contains the tuples `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
