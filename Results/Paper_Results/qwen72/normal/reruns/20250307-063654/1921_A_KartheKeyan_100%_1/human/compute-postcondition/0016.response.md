Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, the new tuple `(x, y)`, the additional new tuple `(x, y)`, and another new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord`.**

Explanation:
- `p1` is calculated as the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord`, i.e., `p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`.
- The values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
