Precondition: **The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes with a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100.**

To better match the function definition with the problem, the function should be defined as follows:
```python
def func(test_cases):
```
Where `test_cases` is a list of test cases, and each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the square's corners.
