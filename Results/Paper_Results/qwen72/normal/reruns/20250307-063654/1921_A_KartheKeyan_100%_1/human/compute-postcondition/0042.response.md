Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord` (which are now undefined because `coord` is empty), `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord` (which are also now undefined because `coord` is empty).**
