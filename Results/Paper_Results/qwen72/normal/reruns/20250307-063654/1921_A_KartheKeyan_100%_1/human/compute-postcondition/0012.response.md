Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x` and `y` to the integers provided by the user. The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`) remain unchanged. The new values of `x` and `y` are now the integers that the user has input.
