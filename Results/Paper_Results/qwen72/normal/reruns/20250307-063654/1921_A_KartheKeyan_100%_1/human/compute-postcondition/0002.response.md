The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is 0. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
