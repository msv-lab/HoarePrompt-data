Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and the newly appended `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is still undefined because `coord` does not contain at least two tuples, `p2` is still undefined because `coord` does not contain at least four tuples.**

The tuple `(x, y)` has been appended to the list `coord`, making it a list that now contains at least two tuples. The other variables remain unchanged. However, since `coord` now contains at least two tuples, `p1` could potentially be defined in the future. `p2` is still undefined because `coord` does not contain at least four tuples.
