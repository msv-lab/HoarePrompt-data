Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the area is flawed. The program calculates the squared distance between two adjacent points (p1 and p2) and then takes the square root of each before multiplying them together. However, the area of a square should be the square of the side length, which can be determined by the distance between two adjacent points on the same side of the square.

A correct approach would be to find the side length by calculating the distance between two adjacent points on the same side and then squaring that distance to get the area. For example, the side length can be determined by the difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of two adjacent points.

Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```

Expected Output:
```
9
```

Actual Output:
```
12
```

The program incorrectly calculates the area as 12 instead of 9.
