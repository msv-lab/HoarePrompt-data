Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, the new tuple `(x, y)`, the additional new tuple `(x, y)`, and another new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is decremented by 1, so `n` is now `n - 1`. Since `n` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing, `n` is still greater than or equal to 0.
- All other variables (`coord`, `res`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.
