Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples, each tuple `(x, y)` representing coordinates provided by the user, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.**

The `coord` list is now sorted based on the tuples' values, while the other variables remain unchanged. The sorted order of the tuples in `coord` will depend on the specific values of the coordinates provided by the user. The values of `p1` and `p2` are still based on the squared Euclidean distances between the first two and the third and fourth tuples in the sorted `coord` list, respectively.
