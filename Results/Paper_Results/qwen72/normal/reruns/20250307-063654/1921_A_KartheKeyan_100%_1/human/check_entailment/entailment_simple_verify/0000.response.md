### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in the list `coord`.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The program sorts the list of coordinates. However, sorting the coordinates in this way does not guarantee that the points are in the correct order to directly calculate the side length of the square. The sorting is done based on the lexicographical order of the tuples, which means it sorts first by the x-coordinate and then by the y-coordinate.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
   - The program calculates `p1` and `p2` as the squared Euclidean distances between the first two and the last two points in the sorted list, respectively.
   - This approach is incorrect because the sorted list does not necessarily place adjacent points on the same side of the square next to each other. For example, in the test case:
     ```
     1 2
     4 5
     1 5
     4 2
     ```
     After sorting, the list becomes:
     ```
     [(1, 2), (1, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5)]
     ```
     Here, `p1` is calculated as the distance between `(1, 2)` and `(1, 5)`, which is 9, and `p2` is calculated as the distance between `(4, 2)` and `(4, 5)`, which is also 9. However, the side length of the square is actually 3, and the area should be \(3^2 = 9\).

4. **Area Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the area by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2` and then multiplying them together. This is incorrect because the area of a square is the square of the side length, not the product of the square roots of two distances.
   - The correct approach would be to calculate the side length by finding the difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of two adjacent points on the same side and then squaring that difference.

5. **Example Test Case:**
   - For the test case:
     ```
     1
     1 2
     4 5
     1 5
     4 2
     ```
     The expected output is `9`, but the program outputs `12` because it incorrectly calculates the area as the product of the square roots of two distances.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases due to the flawed logic in calculating the side length and the area.

Final: **False**
