Output State: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes with a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. The variable `n` is set to the input integer, and the loop runs `n` times. In each iteration, the variable `l` is set to the input integer, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, and `s` is printed. After each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1. Once the loop completes, `n` is 0.**

This output state describes the initial conditions and the changes to the variables `n`, `l`, and `s` after the code has been executed. The loop runs `n` times, and in each iteration, `l` is updated with a new input, `s` is calculated and printed, and `n` is decremented until it reaches 0.
