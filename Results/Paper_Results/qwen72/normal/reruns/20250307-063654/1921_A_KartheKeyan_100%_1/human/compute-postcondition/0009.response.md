Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.**

The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x` and `y` to the integers provided by the user. The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The new values of `x` and `y` are the integers that the user has input, and they are now ready for further use in the program.
