Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples, each tuple `(x, y)` representing coordinates provided by the user, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `p1` by calculating the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in the `coord` list.
- The value of `p1` is now `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p2`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet.
