Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`**

The values of `x` and `y` are now integers provided by the user, while the other variables remain unchanged. The squared Euclidean distances `p1` and `p2` are still dependent on the tuples in `coord`, which is still an empty list.
