Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`, `p2` is still undefined.**

Explanation:
- `p1` is calculated as the squared difference of the x-coordinates of the second and first tuples in `coord`, plus the squared difference of the y-coordinates of the second and first tuples in `coord`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
