Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, the new tuple `(x, y)`, the additional new tuple `(x, y)`, and another new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.**

The list `coord` is now sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple (i.e., `x` values). The other variables remain unchanged.
