Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples, each tuple `(x, y)` representing coordinates provided by the user, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.**

The code snippet updates the value of `p2` to be the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the `coord` list. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
