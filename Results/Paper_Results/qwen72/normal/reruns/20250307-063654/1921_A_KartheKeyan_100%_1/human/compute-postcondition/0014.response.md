Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, the new tuple `(x, y)`, the additional new tuple `(x, y)`, and another new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all 4 iterations, the variable `n` remains greater than 0, `coord` is a list with 4 tuples, each containing a pair of integers `(x, y)` provided by the user, `res` is still 0, and `i` is 3.
