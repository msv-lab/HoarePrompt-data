Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples, each tuple `(x, y)` representing coordinates provided by the user, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all four iterations:
- The variable `n` remains greater than 0.
- The list `coord` now contains four tuples, each representing a pair of coordinates `(x, y)` that were provided by the user.
- The variable `res` is still 0.
- The loop index `i` is 3, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
- The variable `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the user during the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `p1` is now defined as the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in the `coord` list.
- The variable `p2` is now defined as the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the `coord` list.
