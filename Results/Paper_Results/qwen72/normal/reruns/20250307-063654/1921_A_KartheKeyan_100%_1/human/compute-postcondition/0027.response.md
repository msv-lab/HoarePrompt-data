The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the constant `4`, so we can only adjust `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `4`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is undefined because `coord` does not contain at least two tuples, `p2` is undefined because `coord` does not contain at least four tuples.**
