Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`.**

Explanation:
- `p2` is calculated as the squared difference of the x-coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in `coord` plus the squared difference of the y-coordinates of the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, `x`, `y`, and `p1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
