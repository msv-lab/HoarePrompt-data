Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)`, `res` is `math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is decremented by 1, so `n` is now a positive integer that is one less than its previous value.
- All other variables (`i`, `coord`, `res`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
