t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. coordinates is a list of t lists, each containing 4 tuples of integers (x_i, y_i) such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. Each set of 4 coordinates forms a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
