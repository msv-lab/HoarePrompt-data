Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)`, `res` is `math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated to the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `coord`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The expressions for `p1` and `p2` are also unchanged, but their values are used to compute `res`.
