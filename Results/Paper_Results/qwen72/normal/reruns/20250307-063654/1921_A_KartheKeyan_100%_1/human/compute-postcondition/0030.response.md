The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range `4`, so we can only adjust `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The range `4` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and the newly appended `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is still undefined because `coord` does not contain at least two tuples, `p2` is still undefined because `coord` does not contain at least four tuples.**
