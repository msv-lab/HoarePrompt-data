Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.**

The value of `res` is updated to 0. The values of `n`, `coord`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged from their initial state.
