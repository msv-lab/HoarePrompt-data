Output State: **`n` is greater than -1, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples, each tuple `(x, y)` representing coordinates provided by the user, `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first two tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `n - 1`. Since `n` was initially greater than 0, the new value of `n` is greater than -1.
- All other variables (`coord`, `res`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, and `p2`) remain unchanged.
