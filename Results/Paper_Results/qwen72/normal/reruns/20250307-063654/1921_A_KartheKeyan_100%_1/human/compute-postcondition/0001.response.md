Output State: **`n` is 0, the function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes with a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. The loop has run `n` times, and in each iteration, `l` was set to the input integer, `s` was calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, and `s` was printed. After each iteration, `n` was decremented by 1.**
