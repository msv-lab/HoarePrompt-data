Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It calculates the product of the square roots of the squared Euclidean distances between specific pairs of coordinates and prints the rounded result for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `n` is 0, and the program state includes the sorted list of coordinates `coord` and the calculated result `res` for the last test case. **
