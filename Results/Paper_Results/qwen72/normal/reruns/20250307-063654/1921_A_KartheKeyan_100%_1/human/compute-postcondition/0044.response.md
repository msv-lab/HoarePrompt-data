Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the user, `p1` and `p2` are undefined because `coord` is empty.**

The values of `x` and `y` are now integers provided by the user, while the other variables remain unchanged. `p1` and `p2` are still undefined because `coord` is still an empty list.
