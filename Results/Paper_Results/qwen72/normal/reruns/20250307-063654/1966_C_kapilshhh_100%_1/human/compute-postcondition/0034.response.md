To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1, because the range `range(1, n)` will generate values for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `tc` is `tc - 2` and `tc` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
- `dp` is `True`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

For the loop to execute:
- `i` must start at 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`tc` is `tc - 2` and `tc` must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is `True`, `i` is 1**
