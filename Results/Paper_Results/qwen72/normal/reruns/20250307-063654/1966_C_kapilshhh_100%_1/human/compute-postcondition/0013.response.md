Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains:
  - An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5).
  - A list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
- `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or ... or not True)`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `arr`**:
   - `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
   - For example, if the input list `a` is `[5, 3, 2, 7]`, then `arr` would be `[7, 5, 3, 2, 0]`.

2. **Understanding `dp`**:
   - `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or ... or not True)`.
   - Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and followed by 0, `arr[n-1]` is the last element of the sorted list (excluding 0), and `arr[n]` is 0.
   - Therefore, `arr[n-1] - arr[n]` simplifies to `arr[n-1] - 0`, which is `arr[n-1]`.
   - The condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` simplifies to `arr[n-1] > 1`.

3. **Evaluating `dp`**:
   - If `arr[n-1] > 1`, then `dp` is `True`.
   - If `arr[n-1] <= 1`, then `dp` is `False`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print 'Alice' if `dp` is `True`.
   - The `print` statement will print 'Bob' if `dp` is `False`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by 0, the last element `arr[n-1]` (excluding 0) is the smallest unique integer in the list.
- If this smallest unique integer is greater than 1, then `dp` will be `True`.
- If this smallest unique integer is 1 or less, then `dp` will be `False`.

### Output:
Output: **'Alice' if the smallest unique integer in the list `arr` (excluding 0) is greater than 1, otherwise 'Bob'**.
