Output State: **`tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or ... or not True)`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `tc` remains an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `t` remains an integer representing the number of test cases, with the same constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, with the same constraints.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `arr` remains a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
- `dp` will be the result of the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` or the negation of the previous `dp` value, which is recursively defined as `arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1` or the negation of the previous `dp` value, and so on, until the initial value of `dp` (which was True).
- `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
