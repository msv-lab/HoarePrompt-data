To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `tc` is `tc - 2` and `tc` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
     - \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
     - \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
     - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`.
   - `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
   - `dp` is the result of the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp` evaluated for the last iteration.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input, followed by 0. For example, if the input list `a` is `[5, 3, 2, 5, 1]`, then `arr` would be `[5, 3, 2, 1, 0]`.
   - `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp` for the last iteration. Since `arr[n]` is always 0 (the last element in `arr`), the condition simplifies to `arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`.

3. **Evaluating the Condition**:
   - For the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, so `arr[n-1]` is the last element of `arr` before 0.
   - The condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` becomes `arr[n-1] - 0 > 1`, which simplifies to `arr[n-1] > 1`.
   - If `arr[n-1]` is greater than 1, `dp` will be `True`.
   - If `arr[n-1]` is 1 or less, `dp` will be `not dp`.

4. **Determining the Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print 'Alice' if `dp` is `True`, and 'Bob' if `dp` is `False`.
   - Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and contains unique integers followed by 0, the last element before 0 (`arr[n-1]`) is the smallest unique integer in the input list.
   - If the smallest unique integer in the input list is greater than 1, `dp` will be `True`.
   - If the smallest unique integer in the input list is 1, `dp` will be `False` (since `not dp` will be `True` and `1 - 0` is not greater than 1).

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will depend on the smallest unique integer in the input list `a`:
- If the smallest unique integer in `a` is greater than 1, `dp` will be `True`, and 'Alice' will be printed.
- If the smallest unique integer in `a` is 1, `dp` will be `False`, and 'Bob' will be printed.

Since the exact input list `a` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `dp` without knowing the smallest unique integer in `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'Alice' or 'Bob' depending on the smallest unique integer in `a`.

Output: **'Alice' if the smallest unique integer in `a` is greater than 1, otherwise 'Bob'**
