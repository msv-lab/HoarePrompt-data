The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the outcome based on the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`). It returns a list of results, where each result is determined based on the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile for the corresponding test case.**
