Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which matches the problem's input format.

2. **Unique Piles**: The program uses `set` to remove duplicate pile sizes and then sorts the unique pile sizes in descending order. This is a valid approach because the game's outcome depends on the unique pile sizes and not the duplicates.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Logic**: The program uses a boolean variable `dp` to track the winning state. The logic is as follows:
   - If the difference between the current pile size and the next pile size is greater than 1, the current player can always force a win by removing a number of stones that leaves the opponent in a losing position.
   - If the difference is 1 or 0, the current player cannot force a win, and the game state depends on the previous state.

4. **Initial State**: The program initializes `dp` to `True`, assuming Alice can win. This is correct because Alice goes first.

5. **Loop through Piles**: The program iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes and updates the `dp` variable based on the difference between consecutive pile sizes. This correctly determines the winning state for each test case.

6. **Output**: The program prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` and "Bob" if `dp` is `False`, which matches the problem's output format.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem, making it correct.
