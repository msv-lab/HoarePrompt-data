The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It then determines and prints the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the condition that Alice wins if the difference between any two consecutive unique, sorted piles (in descending order) is greater than 1, otherwise Bob wins. The function does not return any value but prints the winner for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `tc` being 0.
