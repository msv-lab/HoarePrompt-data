To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n-1`, and this sequence must contain at least one element for the loop to run.

Given the initial state:
- `tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5
- `n` is `len(arr) - 1`
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0
- `dp` is `True`
- `i` is `n-1`

We need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` starts at 1. The other variables and objects do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is `True`, `i` is 1**
