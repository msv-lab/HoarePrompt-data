Output State: **`tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is True.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` is updated to be the length of `arr` minus 1.
- All other variables (`tc`, `t`, `test_cases`, `arr`, `dp`) remain unchanged.
- The length of `arr` is the number of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, plus one (the trailing 0).
- Therefore, `n` is the number of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
