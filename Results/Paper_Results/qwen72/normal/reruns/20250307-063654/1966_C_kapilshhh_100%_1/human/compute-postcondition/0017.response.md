Output State: **`tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or ... or not True)`, `i` is `n-1`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [0]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, sorts the resulting set in descending order, and appends a 0 to the end of the sorted list.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0. After executing the code snippet, the value of `arr` is updated to match this description.
- The other variables (`tc`, `t`, `test_cases`, `dp`, `i`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
