### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Processing the Piles**:
   - The function converts the list of stones into a set to remove duplicates, sorts it in descending order, and appends a 0 at the end. This is done to simplify the logic for checking the game state.
   - The `dp` variable is initialized to `True`, which represents Alice's turn.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list of unique pile sizes, starting from the largest pile.
   - The condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` is used to determine the winner. This condition checks if the difference between the current pile size and the next pile size is greater than 1. If it is, the current player (Alice or Bob) can win by making a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.
   - The `dp` variable is toggled based on this condition, effectively simulating the turns of the game.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all the piles for a test case, the function prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True` (indicating Alice wins) and "Bob" otherwise.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where all piles are the same size correctly (as seen in the first test case).
   - It also handles the case where there is a single pile correctly (as seen in the last test case).

6. **Optimal Play**:
   - The logic correctly simulates optimal play by ensuring that the player who can force the opponent into a losing position wins. This is achieved by checking the difference between consecutive pile sizes and toggling the `dp` variable accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description and the provided test cases. The use of a set to remove duplicates and sorting the pile sizes in descending order helps in simplifying the game logic. The toggling of the `dp` variable effectively simulates the turns and the winning condition.

Correctness: **True**
