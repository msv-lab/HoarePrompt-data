Output State: **`tc` is `tc - 2` and `tc` must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is the result of the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp` evaluated for the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`tc`**: The value of `tc` remains `tc - 2` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- **`t`**: The number of test cases remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- **`test_cases`**: The list of test cases remains unchanged, containing tuples with an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to the initial value of `n` (since the loop iterates `n-1` times).
- **`arr`**: The list `arr` remains a sorted list of unique integers from the input, followed by 0.
- **`dp`**: The value of `dp` is the result of the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp` evaluated during the last iteration of the loop.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` is `n-1` after the loop completes all iterations.
