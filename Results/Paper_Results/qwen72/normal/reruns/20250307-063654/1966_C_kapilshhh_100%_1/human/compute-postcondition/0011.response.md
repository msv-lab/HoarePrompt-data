Output State: **`tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1 or not (arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not True)`, `i` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp` is updated to `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
- Given `i` is 3, `arr[i]` is `arr[3]` and `arr[i + 1]` is `arr[4]`.
- The new value of `dp` is `arr[3] - arr[4] > 1 or not (arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not True)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
