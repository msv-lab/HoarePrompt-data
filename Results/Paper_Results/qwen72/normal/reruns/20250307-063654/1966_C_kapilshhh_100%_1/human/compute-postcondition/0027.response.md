Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`tc`**: `tc` is defined as `tc - 1` and must be greater than 0. This implies that `tc` is a counter that is decremented and must remain positive.
2. **`t`**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
3. **`test_cases`**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The constraints are:
   - \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
4. **`n`**: `n` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
5. **`arr`**: `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
6. **`dp`**: `dp` is defined as `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or ... or not True)`. This is a complex condition that evaluates to a boolean value.
7. **`i`**: `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`arr` Construction**:
   - `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
   - For example, if the input list `a` is `[5, 3, 8, 1, 4]`, then `arr` would be `[8, 5, 4, 3, 1, 0]`.

2. **`dp` Calculation**:
   - `dp` is a boolean expression that checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is greater than 1.
   - The expression `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or ... or not True)` can be simplified.
   - Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and followed by 0, the last element of `arr` is 0.
   - Therefore, `arr[n-1]` is the last non-zero element of `arr`, and `arr[n]` is 0.
   - The condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` simplifies to `arr[n-1] - 0 > 1`, which is `arr[n-1] > 1`.

3. **Evaluating `dp`**:
   - If `arr[n-1] > 1`, then `dp` is `True`.
   - If `arr[n-1] <= 1`, then `dp` is `False`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output 'Alice' if `dp` is `True`.
   - The `print` statement will output 'Bob' if `dp` is `False`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the structure of `arr`, the value of `dp` depends on whether the last non-zero element of `arr` is greater than 1. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and followed by 0, the last non-zero element is the smallest non-zero element in the list.

Output: **'Alice' if the smallest non-zero element in `arr` is greater than 1, otherwise 'Bob'**.
