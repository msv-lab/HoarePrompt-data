To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head. The loop condition is `tc > 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `tc` is `tc - 2` and `tc` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
- `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or ... or not True)`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

The only variable in the loop head is `tc`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be greater than 0. Since `tc` is `tc - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `tc` is at least 2 to allow the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `tc` is greater than 0. The simplest way to do this is to set `tc` to a value that is at least 2.

State: **`tc` is `tc - 2` and `tc` must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or ... or not True)`, `i` is `n-1`**
