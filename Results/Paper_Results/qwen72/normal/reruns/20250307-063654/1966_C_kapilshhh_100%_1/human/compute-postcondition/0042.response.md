Output State: **`tc` is `tc - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is the result of the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp` evaluated for the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`.**
