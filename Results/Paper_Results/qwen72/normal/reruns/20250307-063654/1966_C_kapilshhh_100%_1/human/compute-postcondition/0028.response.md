Output State: **`tc` is `tc - 2` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not (arr[n-2] - arr[n-1] > 1 or ... or not True)`, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tc` is decremented by 1, so `tc` becomes `tc - 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
