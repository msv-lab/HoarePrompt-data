Output State: **`tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not True`, `i` is 1.**

In natural language: The value of `dp` is updated to be `True` if the difference between the second and third elements in `arr` is greater than 1, or `False` if the difference is 1 or less. The other variables remain unchanged.
