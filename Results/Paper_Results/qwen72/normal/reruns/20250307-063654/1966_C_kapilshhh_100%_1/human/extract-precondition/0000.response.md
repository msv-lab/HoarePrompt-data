Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile, respectively). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

This would allow the function to process the number of test cases and the details of each test case as described in the problem.
