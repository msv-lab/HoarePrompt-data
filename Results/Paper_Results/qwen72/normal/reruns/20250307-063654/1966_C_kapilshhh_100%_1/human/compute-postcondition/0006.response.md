To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
- `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0.
- `dp` is True.

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` must start at 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is True, `i` is 1.**
