Output State: **`tc` is `tc - 1` and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is `True`, `i` is `n-1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `len(arr) - 1`, which is the length of the list `arr` minus 1. Since `arr` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order followed by 0, `len(arr)` is at least 2 (one unique integer and 0), so `n` will be at least 1.
- All other variables (`tc`, `t`, `test_cases`, `arr`, `dp`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
