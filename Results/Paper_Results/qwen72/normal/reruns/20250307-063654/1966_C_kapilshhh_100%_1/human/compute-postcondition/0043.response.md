Output State: **`tc` is `0`, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than or equal to the initial value of `n` for each test case, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is the result of the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp` evaluated for the last iteration of each test case, `i` is `n-1` for each test case.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all the iterations, the variable `tc` will be `0` because the loop decrements `tc` by 1 each time it runs, and it stops when `tc` is no longer greater than 0. The variable `t` remains an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` remains a list of tuples containing the initial input values for each test case. The variable `n` for each test case will still be greater than or equal to the initial value of `n` (the number of unique integers in the input list plus one for the appended 0). The list `arr` for each test case will be a sorted list of unique integers from the input, followed by 0. The variable `dp` will hold the final result of the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp` evaluated for the last iteration of each test case, which determines whether "Alice" or "Bob" is printed. The variable `i` will be `n-1` for each test case, indicating the last index that was checked in the loop.
