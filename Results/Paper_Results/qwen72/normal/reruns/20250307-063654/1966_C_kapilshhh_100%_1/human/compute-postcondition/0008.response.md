The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 2).

State: **`tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not True`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
