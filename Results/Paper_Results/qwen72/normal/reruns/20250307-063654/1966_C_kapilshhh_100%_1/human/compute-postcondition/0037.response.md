Output State: **`tc` is `tc - 2` and `tc` must be greater than or equal to 2, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of unique integers from the input, sorted in descending order, followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not (arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not True)`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp` is updated to `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not (arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not True)`.
- `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not True` simplifies to `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or False`, which is just `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1`.
- Therefore, `dp` is now `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not (arr[1] - arr[2] > 1)`.
- The values of `tc`, `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
