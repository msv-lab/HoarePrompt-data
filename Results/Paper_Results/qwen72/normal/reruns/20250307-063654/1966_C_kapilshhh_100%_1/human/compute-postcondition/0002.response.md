Output State: **`tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `n` is an input integer.**
