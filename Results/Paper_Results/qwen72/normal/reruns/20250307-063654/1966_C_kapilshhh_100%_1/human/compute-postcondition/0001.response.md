The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

State: **`tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
