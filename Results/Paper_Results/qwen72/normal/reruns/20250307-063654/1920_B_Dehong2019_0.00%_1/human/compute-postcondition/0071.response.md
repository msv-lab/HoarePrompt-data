Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer, `k` is a new input integer and must be greater than 0, `x` is a new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input, `ans1` is `ans1 - 2 * a[0] - 2 * a[1] - 2 * a[2]`, `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, `ans` is `ans1 - 2 * a[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` updates the value of `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[2]` from its current value.
- The initial value of `ans1` is `ans1 - 2 * a[0] - 2 * a[1]`.
- After the code execution, `ans1` becomes `ans1 - 2 * a[0] - 2 * a[1] - 2 * a[2]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `a`, `ans2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
