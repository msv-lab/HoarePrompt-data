Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `i` is 0. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, and `ans2` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a`. Otherwise, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus `a[0]`, and `ans2` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a`.***
