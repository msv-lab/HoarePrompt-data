Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input, and the current value of `i + x` is less than `n`.**
