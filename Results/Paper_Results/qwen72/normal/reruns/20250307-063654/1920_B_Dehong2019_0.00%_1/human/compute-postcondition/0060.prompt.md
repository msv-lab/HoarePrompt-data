Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `x-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `ans2` is the value of `ans1`, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise it is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input, `ans1` is updated based on the condition `i + x < n` (if true, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`; otherwise, `ans1` remains the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]`), `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input, `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
