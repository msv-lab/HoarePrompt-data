Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a`, `i` is `x-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The variable `x` is an input integer and does not change.
- The list `a` remains sorted in descending order.
- The variable `ans1` starts as the sum of all integers in the list `a`. After the loop completes, `ans1` is reduced by twice the value of each of the first `x` integers in the list `a`. In other words, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a`.
- The loop variable `i` will be `x-1` after the loop has completed all iterations, because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x-1`.
