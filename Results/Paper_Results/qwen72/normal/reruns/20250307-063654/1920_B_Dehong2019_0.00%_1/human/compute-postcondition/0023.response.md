Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[i]`. `ans2` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a`. `ans` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.***
