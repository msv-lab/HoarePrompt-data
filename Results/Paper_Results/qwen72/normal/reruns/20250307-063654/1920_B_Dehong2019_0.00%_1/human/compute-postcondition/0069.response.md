Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer, `k` is a new input integer and must be greater than 0, `x` is a new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input, `ans1` is `ans1 - 2 * a[0] - 2 * a[1]`, `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, `ans` is `ans1 - 2 * a[0]`**

Explanation:
- `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[1]` from its current value, which was `ans1 - 2 * a[0]`.
- The new value of `ans1` is `ans1 - 2 * a[0] - 2 * a[1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
