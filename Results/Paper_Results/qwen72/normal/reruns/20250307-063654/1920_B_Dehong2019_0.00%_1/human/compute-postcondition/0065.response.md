Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is a new input integer, `k` is a new input integer and must be greater than 0, `x` is a new input integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `k-1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans1 = sum(a)` updates the value of `ans1` to be the sum of all integers in the list `a`.
- The initial state of `ans1` was a more complex expression, but now it is simply the sum of all integers in `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `a`, `ans2`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
