Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer, `k` is a new input integer and must be greater than 1, `x` is a new input integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains `ans1 - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1]) + a[0] + a[1]`. `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `a`, `ans1`, `ans2`) remain unchanged or retain their values as described in the initial state.
