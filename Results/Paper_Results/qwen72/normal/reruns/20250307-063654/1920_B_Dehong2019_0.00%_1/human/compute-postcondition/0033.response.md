Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[x] + a[x+1] + ... + a[x+k-1])` if `x + k - 1 < n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus the sum of the first `k` integers in the list `a`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations, and `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The variables `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned new values from the input.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
