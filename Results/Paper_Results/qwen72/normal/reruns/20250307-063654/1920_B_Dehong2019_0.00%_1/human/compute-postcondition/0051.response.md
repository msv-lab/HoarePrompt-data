Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise it is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` plus `a[1]`, `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it.
- Since `i` is 1, `ans1` now includes the value of `a[1]` in addition to its previous value.
- The value of `ans2` remains the same as it was before the update.
- The value of `ans` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and the unchanged `ans2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `a`) remain unchanged.
