Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus `a[0]`, plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a`, `ans` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` updates the value of `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its current value.
- The initial value of `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise it is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus `a[0]` plus `a[i]`.
- After the code snippet is executed, `ans1` is further reduced by `2 * a[i + x]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is still the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.
