Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer, `k` is a new input integer and must be greater than 2, `x` is a new input integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from it.
- The value of `ans2` remains the value of `ans1` before the update.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet.
- `ans` is still the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations, but this specific code snippet only updates `ans1` for the current iteration.
