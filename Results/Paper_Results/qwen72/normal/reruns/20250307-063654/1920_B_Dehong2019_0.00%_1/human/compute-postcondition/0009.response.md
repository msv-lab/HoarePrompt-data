Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the first integer in the list `a` minus twice the second integer in the list `a`, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting twice the value of the second element in the list `a` (since `i` is 1).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
