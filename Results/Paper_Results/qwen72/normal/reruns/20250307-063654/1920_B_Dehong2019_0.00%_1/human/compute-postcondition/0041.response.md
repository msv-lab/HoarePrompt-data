Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]` minus `2 * a[2]`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts `2 * a[2]` from `ans1`.
- The initial value of `ans1` was the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[0]` and then minus `2 * a[1]`.
- After the execution of the code, `ans1` is now the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]` minus `2 * a[2]`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `ans2`, and `a` remain unchanged.
