Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a` plus `a[0]`, `ans2` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` integers in the list `a`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**
