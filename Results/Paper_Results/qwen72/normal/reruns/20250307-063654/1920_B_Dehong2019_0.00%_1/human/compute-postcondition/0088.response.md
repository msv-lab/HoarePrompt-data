Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer, `k` is a new input integer and must be greater than 2, `x` is a new input integer and must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged. `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, and `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations.***
