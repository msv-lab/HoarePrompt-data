Output State: **The initial state remains unchanged as the provided code snippet does not contain any executable statements that modify the variables.**

The code snippet consists of comments and does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, or the array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Therefore, all the initial conditions and variable values remain the same.
