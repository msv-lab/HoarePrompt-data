The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `x` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus twice the first integer in the list `a` minus twice the second integer in the list `a`, `i` is 2**
