Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need a specific value, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `x` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the new input, `ans2` is the value of `ans1` before the update, `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - a[2 + x] * 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.***
