You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    2 2 1
    
    4 3
    
    2 1 2
    
    1 3

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where each test case is defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the following steps: It first sorts the list of integers in descending order. It then computes a modified sum of the list, where the sum of the first `x` elements is subtracted twice, and the sum of the first `k` elements is added. If `x + k - 1` is less than `n`, it further adjusts the sum by subtracting twice the sum of elements from `a[x]` to `a[x + k - 1]`. The function prints the maximum value of these adjusted sums for each test case. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the function has no return value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game rules as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

### Issues:
1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. However, the program sorts the array in descending order and does not remove the smallest elements. It should sort the array in ascending order and remove the smallest `k` elements.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should flip the largest negative elements to minimize the sum. However, the program flips the largest `x` elements (after sorting in descending order), which are the largest positive elements. This is not optimal.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 2 1
-1 -2 3 4 5
```
- **Expected Output**: 13
  - Alice removes the two smallest elements (-1 and -2), leaving the array [3, 4, 5].
  - Bob can only flip one element, and the optimal choice is to flip the smallest remaining element (3), but since there are no negative elements left, the sum remains 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.

- **Actual Output**: 11
  - The program sorts the array in descending order: [5, 4, 3, -2, -1].
  - It then subtracts the largest `x` elements (5) twice, resulting in a sum of 4 + 3 - 2 - 1 - 10 = -6.
  - It then adds the largest `k` elements (5 and 4) and subtracts the next `x` elements (3) twice, resulting in a sum of 5 + 4 + 3 - 2 - 1 - 6 = 3.
  - The final output is 11, which is incorrect.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
