Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, and `pd[10]` which is the sum of the digits in the tens place of all integers from 10 to `n` that have a tens place digit, `i` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `n`.
- For each integer `i`, the loop converts `i` to a string and iterates over each character in the string.
- For each character `j` in the string representation of `i`, the integer value of `j` is added to `pd[i]`.
- After the loop completes, `pd[1]` will contain the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.
- `pd[10]` will contain the sum of the digits in the tens place of all integers from 10 to `n` that have a tens place digit.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop has finished executing all iterations.
