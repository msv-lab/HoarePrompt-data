The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `N-1` (since the range is `1, N` and the loop stops when `i` reaches `N`).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. The next iteration of the loop will increment `i` by 1, so `i` will be `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `N`.

Given that `N` is 200001 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `i` will be `n + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since `n` is at most 200000, `i` will still be less than `N` (200001).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, and `pd[10]` which is the sum of the digits in the tens place of all integers from 10 to `n` that have a tens place digit, `i` is `n + 1`**
