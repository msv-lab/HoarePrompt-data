The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `n` from the user, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`. It precomputes a list `pd` of length 200001, where `pd[i]` represents the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` for each `i` in the range 1 to 200000. For each test case, it prints the value of `pd[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
