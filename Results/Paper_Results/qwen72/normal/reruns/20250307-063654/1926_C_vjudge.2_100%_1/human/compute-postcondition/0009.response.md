The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 10
- `j` is '0'

The string representation of `i` is "10", which has two characters: '1' and '0'. The loop has already processed the first character '0'. For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to process the next character, which is '1'. The index `j` will be set to the next character in the string "10".

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the integer value of the first character of `str(i)`, and `pd[10]` which is now `pd[10]` + 0, `i` is 10, `j` is '1'**
