### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `N` and `pd`**:
   - `N` is set to 200001, which is `2 * 100000 + 1`. This is appropriate because the maximum value of `n` is `2 * 10^5`.
   - `pd` is initialized as a list of 200001 zeros. This list will store the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` for each `i` in the range 1 to `N-1`.

2. **Precomputation of `pd`**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, N):` iterates from 1 to 200000.
   - `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` ensures that `pd[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the digits from 1 to `i-1`.
   - The inner loop `for j in str(i):` converts the integer `i` to a string and iterates over each digit. Each digit is converted back to an integer and added to `pd[i]`.
   - After this loop, `pd[i]` will contain the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - `t = int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
   - The loop `for _ in range(t):` iterates over each test case.
   - `n = int(input())` reads the value of `n` for the current test case.
   - `print(pd[n])` prints the precomputed sum of the digits for the integer `n`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly precomputes the sum of the digits for all integers from 1 to 200000.
  - For each test case, it retrieves the precomputed sum for the given `n` and prints it.
  - The precomputation step ensures that the program can handle each test case in constant time, which is crucial given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The precomputation step runs in O(N) time, where N is 200000. This is efficient and within acceptable limits.
  - Each test case is handled in O(1) time, which is optimal for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficient, meeting the problem's requirements and constraints.
