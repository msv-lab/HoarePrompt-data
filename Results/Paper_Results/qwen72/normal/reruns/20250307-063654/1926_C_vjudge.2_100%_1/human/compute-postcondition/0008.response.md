Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the integer value of the first character of `str(i)`, and `pd[10]` which is now `pd[10]` + 0, `i` is 10, `j` is '0'.**

Explanation:
- The code `pd[i] += int(j)` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it.
- `i` is 10, and `j` is '0', so `int(j)` is 0.
- Therefore, `pd[10]` is incremented by 0, which means it remains unchanged.
- The initial state of `pd[10]` is 0, so after the code execution, `pd[10]` is still 0.
- The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
