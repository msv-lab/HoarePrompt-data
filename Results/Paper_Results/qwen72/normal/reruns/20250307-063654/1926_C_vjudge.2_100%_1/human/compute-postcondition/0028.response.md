Output State: **`i` is a positive integer (at least 3), `j` is the third character of the string representation of `i`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the third character of `i` plus the integer value of the second character of `i` plus the integer value of the first character of `i`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains a positive integer (at least 3).
- The value of `j` remains the third character of the string representation of `i`.
- `pd[i]` is initially increased by the integer value of the second character of `i` plus the integer value of the first character of `i`.
- The code `pd[i] += int(j)` further increases `pd[i]` by the integer value of `j`, which is the third character of the string representation of `i`.
- Therefore, `pd[i]` is now increased by the integer value of the third character of `i` plus the integer value of the second character of `i` plus the integer value of the first character of `i`.
