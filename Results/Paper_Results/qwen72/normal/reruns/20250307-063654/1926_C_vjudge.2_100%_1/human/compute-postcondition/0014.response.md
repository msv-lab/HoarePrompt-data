The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute if `i` can be converted to a string and has at least one character. Given that `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` will always be a positive integer greater than 1, ensuring that `str(i)` will have at least one character. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once with the given constraints.

However, for the loop to execute, `i` must be a positive integer, and `j` will be the first character of `str(i)`.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, and `pd[10]` which is the sum of the digits in the tens place of all integers from 10 to `n` that have a tens place digit, `i` is `n + 1`, `pd[i]` is `pd[i - 1]` (which is `pd[n]`), `j` is the first character of `str(i)`**
