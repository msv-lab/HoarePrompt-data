The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or process values `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function processes values `t` and `n` internally, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 · 10^5 for each test case. The exact return value is not specified.**
