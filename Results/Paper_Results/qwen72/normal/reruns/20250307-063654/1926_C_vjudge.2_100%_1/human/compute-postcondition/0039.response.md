To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user, and it is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement that references `pd[n]`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `pd` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we need to assume that `pd` is a list or some other sequence that has been defined elsewhere in the code.
   - The value of `n` is an integer input by the user, and it is used as an index to access an element in the `pd` list.
   - Since `pd` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `pd[n]` without additional information about the contents of `pd`.

Given the lack of information about the contents of `pd`, the best we can do is describe the output in terms of the structure of the problem:

Output: **pd[n] (where pd is a list or sequence and n is an integer input by the user)**
