The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters of the string representation of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is the first character of `str(i)`, which is '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must remain the same, and `j` must be the next character in `str(i)`. Since `str(i)` is '1' and has only one character, the loop will not execute again unless `i` is incremented or changed to a number with more than one digit.

However, since the task is to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, and the current state of `i` does not allow for another iteration, we need to assume that `i` is a number with more than one digit. For simplicity, let's assume `i` is 10 (the smallest two-digit number). In this case, `j` will be the first character of `str(i)`, which is '1', and the loop will execute again with `j` being '0' in the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is now `pd[0]` + the integer value of the first character of `str(i)`, `i` is 10, `j` is '0'**
