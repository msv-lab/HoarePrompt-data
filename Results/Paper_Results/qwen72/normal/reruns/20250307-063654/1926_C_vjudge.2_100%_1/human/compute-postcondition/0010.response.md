Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the integer value of the first character of `str(i)`, and `pd[10]` which is now `pd[10]` + 1, `i` is 10, `j` is '1'**

Explanation:
- The value of `pd[10]` is incremented by `int(j)`, which is 1.
- The initial value of `pd[10]` was 0, so after the execution, `pd[10]` is 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
