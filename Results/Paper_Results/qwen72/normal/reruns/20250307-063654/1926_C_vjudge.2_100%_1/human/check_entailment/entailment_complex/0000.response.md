Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the integer `n` from the user. This matches the problem description.

2. **Precomputation of `pd`**:
   - The program initializes a list `pd` of length 200001 with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to 200000.
   - For each `i`, it updates `pd[i]` to be the sum of `pd[i-1]` and the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - This precomputation ensures that `pd[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

3. **Output for Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` and prints `pd[n]`, which is the precomputed cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.
   - This matches the problem requirement to output the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(N) time, where N is 200000. This is efficient and within the time limit for the problem.
   - Each test case is processed in O(1) time by simply accessing the precomputed value `pd[n]`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly, as `pd[1]` will be 1.
   - It also handles larger values of `n` up to 200000 correctly, as the precomputation covers all possible values of `n`.

6. **Correctness of Precomputation**:
   - The inner loop that sums the digits of `i` is correct. It converts `i` to a string and iterates over each character, converting it back to an integer and adding it to `pd[i]`.
   - The cumulative sum is correctly maintained in `pd[i]` by adding `pd[i-1]` to the sum of the digits of `i`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
