The code snippet `pd[i] += int(j)` updates the value at the index `i` in the dictionary `pd` by adding the integer value of the first character of the string representation of `i` to it. The value of `i` remains a positive integer (at least 3), and `j` remains the first character of the string representation of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer (at least 3), `j` is the first character of the string representation of `i`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of `j`.**
