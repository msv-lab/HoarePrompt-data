Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, and `pd[10]` which is the sum of the digits in the tens place of all integers from 10 to `n` that have a tens place digit, `pd[i]` is now `pd[i]` + the integer value of the first character of `str(i)`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is the first character of `str(i)`**

Explanation:
- The code `pd[i] += int(j)` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of the first character of `str(i)`.
- Since `i` is `n + 1`, the first character of `str(i)` is `j`, and `pd[i]` was initially 0 (as per the initial state, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except for `pd[1]` and `pd[10]`).
- Therefore, `pd[i]` is now equal to the integer value of the first character of `str(i)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
