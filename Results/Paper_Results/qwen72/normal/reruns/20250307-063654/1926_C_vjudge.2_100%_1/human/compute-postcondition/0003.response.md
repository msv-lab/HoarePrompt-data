The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. The loop starts with `i` at 1 and iterates up to `N-1`. For the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case
- `N` is 200001
- `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros

Since `N` is already 200001, which is greater than 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1**
