Output State: **`i` is a positive integer (at least 3), `pd[i]` is increased by the sum of the digits of `i`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` remains a positive integer (at least 3), and the value of `pd[i]` is increased by the sum of the digits of `i`. The loop iterates over each digit in the string representation of `i`, and for each digit, it adds the integer value of that digit to `pd[i]`. By the end of the loop, `pd[i]` will have been incremented by the total sum of all the digits in `i`. The other variables and their initial states remain unchanged.
