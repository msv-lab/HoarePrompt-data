Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores these sums in the `pd` array. This allows the program to efficiently handle multiple test cases by simply looking up the precomputed sum for the given `n`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `N` is set to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\) to cover all possible values of `n` up to \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - `pd` is initialized to a list of zeros of length `N`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - For each integer `i` from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\), the program updates `pd[i]` by adding the sum of the digits of `i` to `pd[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `pd[i]` contains the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints `pd[n]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly computes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `n` for each test case. Given the problem's constraints and the efficient precomputation, the program should work correctly for all potential inputs.
