The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `N` is 200001. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `N` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`. Since `N` is 200001, the loop will execute again as long as `n + 2` is less than 200001.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, and `pd[10]` which is the sum of the digits in the tens place of all integers from 10 to `n` that have a tens place digit, `i` is `n + 2`, `pd[i]` is now `pd[i - 1]` + the sum of the digits of `i`**.
