The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string representation of `i`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string representation of `i`. If `i` is a positive integer, the loop will execute because the string representation of a positive integer will have at least one character.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `pd[i]` is `2 * pd[i - 1]` + the sum of the digits of `i`

To ensure the loop executes, `i` must be a positive integer, which means `n` must be at least 0. However, since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` will always be a positive integer (since `i = n + 2` and `n` is at least 1, making `i` at least 3).

Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is a positive integer, which it is based on the given conditions. The variable `j` will take on each character of the string representation of `i` during the loop.

State: **`i` is a positive integer (at least 3), `j` is the first character of the string representation of `i`**
