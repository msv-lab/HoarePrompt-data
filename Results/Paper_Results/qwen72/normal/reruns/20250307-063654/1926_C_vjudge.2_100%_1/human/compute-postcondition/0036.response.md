To determine what will be printed by the `print(pd[n])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, and it is constrained such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so it can be ignored).
- `n` is an integer input by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(pd[n])
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `pd` is not defined in the initial state. This means that `pd` must be a list or a dictionary that is defined elsewhere in the code, but we don't have that information in the initial state.
- The code attempts to print the value of `pd` at index `n` (if `pd` is a list) or the value associated with the key `n` (if `pd` is a dictionary).

### Conclusion:
Since `pd` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed. However, we can describe the expected output based on the structure of the problem:

- If `pd` is a list, the code will print the element at index `n` of the list `pd`.
- If `pd` is a dictionary, the code will print the value associated with the key `n` in the dictionary `pd`.

### Output:
Output: **pd[n] (where pd is a list or dictionary and n is an integer input by the user)**

This output is the most precise description possible given the information provided.
