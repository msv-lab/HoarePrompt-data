You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
def func():
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [0 for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
        for j in str(i):
            pd[i] += int(j)
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(pd[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `n` from the user, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`. It precomputes a list `pd` of length 200001, where `pd[i]` represents the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` for each `i` in the range 1 to 200000. For each test case, it prints the value of `pd[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores these sums in the `pd` array. This allows the program to efficiently handle multiple test cases by simply looking up the precomputed sum for the given `n`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `N` is set to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\) to cover all possible values of `n` up to \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - `pd` is initialized to a list of zeros of length `N`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - For each integer `i` from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\), the program updates `pd[i]` by adding the sum of the digits of `i` to `pd[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `pd[i]` contains the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints `pd[n]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly computes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `n` for each test case. Given the problem's constraints and the efficient precomputation, the program should work correctly for all potential inputs.
