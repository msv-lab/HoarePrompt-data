Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, and `pd[10]` which is the sum of the digits in the tens place of all integers from 10 to `n` that have a tens place digit, `i` is `n + 1`, `pd[i]` is `pd[i - 1]` (which is `pd[n]`).**

Explanation:
- The code `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the value of `pd[i - 1]` to it.
- Given that `i` is `n + 1`, the code effectively sets `pd[n + 1]` to `pd[n]` (since `pd[n + 1]` was initially 0).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
