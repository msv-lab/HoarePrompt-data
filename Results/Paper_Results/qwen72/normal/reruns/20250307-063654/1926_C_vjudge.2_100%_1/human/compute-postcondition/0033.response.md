To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer input by the user, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement: `print(pd[n])`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `pd` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to infer its possible definition or content.
   - Since `pd` is being indexed with `n`, it suggests that `pd` is a list or a dictionary.
   - However, without knowing the exact content or structure of `pd`, we cannot determine the precise value of `pd[n]`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `pd[n]`, but since `pd` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **pd[n] (where pd is a list or dictionary and n is an integer input by the user)**
