The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer input by the user with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. At the start of the next iteration, `_` is increased by 1, so `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer input by the user.**
