The loop head involves the variables `i` and `j`, where `j` is the character from the string representation of `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is a positive integer (at least 3).
- `j` is the first character of the string representation of `i`.
- `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of `j`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state of `j` needs to be adjusted to the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Given that `j` is the first character of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be the second character of `i`.

State: **`i` is a positive integer (at least 3), `j` is the second character of the string representation of `i`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the first character of `i`**
