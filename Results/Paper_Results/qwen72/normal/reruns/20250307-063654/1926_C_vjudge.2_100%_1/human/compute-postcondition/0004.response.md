Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is now `pd[0]`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` increments the value at index `i` of the list `pd` by the value at index `i - 1`. Initially, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros, and `i` is 1. Therefore, `pd[1]` is incremented by `pd[0]`, which is 0. As a result, `pd[1]` remains 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
