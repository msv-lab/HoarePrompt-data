The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it starts from 0 by default in Python when using `range`.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
