The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `j`, and the loop iterates over the string representation of `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses.

1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is a positive integer (at least 3).
   - `j` is the second character of the string representation of `i`.
   - `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the second character of `i` plus the integer value of the first character of `i`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.
   - After the first iteration, `j` will be the second character of `i`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to the next character in the string representation of `i`.
   - If `i` is a positive integer with at least 3 characters in its string representation, the loop will execute for the third character of `i`.

4. **Adjustments:**
   - `j` should be the third character of the string representation of `i`.
   - The state of `i` remains the same because the loop is iterating over the string representation of `i`, and `i` itself is not being modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is a positive integer (at least 3), `j` is the third character of the string representation of `i`, `pd[i]` is increased by the integer value of the second character of `i` plus the integer value of the first character of `i`**.
