Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `N` is set to 200001 to cover the range of possible values for `n` (up to 200000).
   - `pd` is a list initialized with zeros of length `N`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200000 and stores these sums in the `pd` list.
   - For each number `i` from 1 to 200000:
     - `pd[i]` is updated to be the sum of `pd[i-1]` and the sum of the digits of `i`.
     - This is done by converting `i` to a string, iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer, and adding it to `pd[i]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `n` using `pd[n]`.

This approach is efficient because it leverages precomputation to handle multiple test cases quickly. The time complexity for precomputation is O(N * log N), where N is the maximum value (200000), and the time complexity for processing each test case is O(1). This ensures that the program can handle up to 10,000 test cases within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

The program correctly follows the problem description and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
