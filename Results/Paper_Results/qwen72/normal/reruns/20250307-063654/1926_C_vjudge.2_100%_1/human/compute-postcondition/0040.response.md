Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` for each `i` in the range 1 to `N-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations:
- The value of `t` remains the same as it was initially, an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The loop variable `_` has reached the value `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `n` is the integer input by the user for the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `N` remains 200001, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `pd` remains unchanged, containing 200001 integers where each `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` for each `i` in the range 1 to 200000.
