The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string representation of `i` (`str(i)`). The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the last character of `str(i)`, and `i` is `n + 1`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop:

1. **`j`**: Since `j` is the loop variable that iterates over each character of `str(i)`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be the first character of `str(i)`.

2. **`i`**: The value of `i` remains the same, as the loop variable `j` is iterating over the characters of `i`, not changing `i` itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, and `pd[10]` which is the sum of the digits in the tens place of all integers from 10 to `n` that have a tens place digit, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is the first character of `str(i)`**.
