Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 integers where `pd[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` for each `i` in the range 1 to `N-1`, and `i` is `N-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5 for each test case.
- The variable `N` remains 200001.
- The list `pd` is now populated with integers such that each element `pd[i]` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) is the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.
- The loop index `i` has reached the value `N-1`, which is 200000.
