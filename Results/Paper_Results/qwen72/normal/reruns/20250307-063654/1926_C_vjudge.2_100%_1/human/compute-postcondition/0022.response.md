Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, and `pd[10]` which is the sum of the digits in the tens place of all integers from 10 to `n` that have a tens place digit, `i` is `n + 2`, `pd[i]` is now `2 * pd[i - 1]` + the sum of the digits of `i`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `pd[i]` is updated to `pd[i] + pd[i - 1]`.
- Given that `pd[i]` was initially `pd[i - 1] + the sum of the digits of i`, after the update, `pd[i]` becomes `2 * pd[i - 1] + the sum of the digits of i`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
