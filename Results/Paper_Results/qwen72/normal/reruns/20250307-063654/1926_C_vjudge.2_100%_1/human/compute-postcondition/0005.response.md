The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is a positive integer because `str(i)` will then be a non-empty string, allowing the loop to iterate over each character in the string.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `i` is 1, which is a positive integer.
- `j` is not explicitly initialized but will be set to each character of `str(i)` during the loop execution.

Since `i` is already 1, the loop will execute at least once. There is no need to adjust `i` or `j` for the loop to execute. However, to ensure clarity and completeness, we can state that `i` must be a positive integer and `j` will be set to the characters of `str(i)`.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is now `pd[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` will be set to each character of `str(i)` during the loop execution**
