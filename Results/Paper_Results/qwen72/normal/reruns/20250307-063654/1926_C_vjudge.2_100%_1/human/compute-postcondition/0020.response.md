Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, and `pd[10]` which is the sum of the digits in the tens place of all integers from 10 to `n` that have a tens place digit, `i` is `n + 1`, `pd[i]` is now `pd[i - 1]` + the sum of the digits of `i`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`, which is `n + 1`.
- For each character `j` in `str(i)`, the loop adds the integer value of `j` to `pd[i]`.
- After the loop has executed all its iterations, `pd[i]` will have been incremented by the sum of the digits of `i`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `N` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The value of `pd[1]` and `pd[10]` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The value of `i` remains `n + 1` as it is not modified within the loop.
