Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is now `pd[0]` + the integer value of the first character of `str(i)`, `i` is 1, `j` is the first character of `str(i)`**

Explanation:
- The code `pd[i] += int(j)` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it.
- `i` is 1, so `pd[1]` is updated.
- `j` is set to each character of `str(i)`, and since `i` is 1, `j` is the first character of `str(1)`, which is `'1'`.
- `int('1')` is 1, so `pd[1]` is incremented by 1.
- The initial value of `pd[1]` was `pd[0]`, so after the execution, `pd[1]` is `pd[0] + 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `N`, `i`, and the rest of `pd` remain unchanged.
