Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros except `pd[1]` which is `pd[0]` + the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, and `pd[10]` which is the sum of the digits in the tens place of all integers from 10 to `n` that have a tens place digit, `pd[i]` is now `pd[i]` + the integer value of the first character of `str(i)` + the integer value of the second character of `str(i)`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is the second character of `str(i)` if `i` has more than one character, otherwise the loop does not execute again.**
