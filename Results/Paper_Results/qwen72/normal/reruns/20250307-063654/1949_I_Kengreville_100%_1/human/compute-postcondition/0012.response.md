Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list remains a list of length `n` where all elements are `False`, and `coef` remains a list of `None` values with length `n`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will each have `n` elements, with each element being the value of an integer input by the user. The `visited` list will still contain `False` for all its elements, and the `coef` list will still be filled with `None` values.
