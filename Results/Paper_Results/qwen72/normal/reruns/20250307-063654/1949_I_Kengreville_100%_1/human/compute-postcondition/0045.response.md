The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on the following inputs: `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 1000, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers each of length `n`, and for each index `i` (0 <= i < n), `x[i]` and `y[i]` are integers in the range -10^9 to 10^9, and `r[i]` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^9. Additionally, `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n`, where all elements in `visited` are initially `False`, and all elements in `coef` are initially `None`.

The function returns a value based on the processing of these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` based on the integer `n` and return a result that is not explicitly defined.

Functionality: **The function processes lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` based on the integer `n` where 1 <= n <= 1000, and returns a result that is not explicitly defined.**
