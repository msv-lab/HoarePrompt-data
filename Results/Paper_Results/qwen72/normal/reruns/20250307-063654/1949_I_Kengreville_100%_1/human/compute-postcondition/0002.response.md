Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers where each list has length `n`, and for each `i` (0 <= `i` < `n`), `r[i]` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^9, `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n`, initially all elements in `visited` are `False`, and `coef` is initialized with `None` values.**

The code `y = [None] * n` reassigns the list `y` to a new list of `None` values with length `n`. The initial state of `y` being a list of integers is no longer valid, and now `y` is a list of `None` values. All other variables and their initial states remain unchanged.
