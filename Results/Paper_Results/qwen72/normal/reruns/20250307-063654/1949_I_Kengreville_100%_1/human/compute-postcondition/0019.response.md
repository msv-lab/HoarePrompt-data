Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list remains a list of length `n` where all elements are `False`, and `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which is 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`. Additionally, the current value of `visited[i]` is `False`.**

The code snippet `tot = 0` does not change the value of `tot` because it was already initialized to 0 in the initial state. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
