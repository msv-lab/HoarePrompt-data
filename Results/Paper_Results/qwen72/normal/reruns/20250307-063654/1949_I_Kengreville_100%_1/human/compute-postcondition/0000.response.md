Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where each list has length `n`, and for each `i` (0 <= `i` < `n`), `x[i]` and `y[i]` are integers in the range -10^9 to 10^9, and `r[i]` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^9. `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n`, initially all elements in `visited` are `False`, and `coef` is initialized with `None` values.**
