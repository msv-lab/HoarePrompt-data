Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list remains a list of length `n` where all elements are `False` except for `visited[0]` which is `True`. The `coef` list remains a list of `None` values with length `n` except for `coef[0]` and `coef[1]` which are both 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**

The code snippet `tot = 0` reassigns the variable `tot` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `tot` remains unchanged. The other variables and their states are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
