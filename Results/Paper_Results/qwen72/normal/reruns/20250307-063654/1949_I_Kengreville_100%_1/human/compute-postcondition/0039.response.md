Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`. The `coef` list is a list of length `n` where each element is 1 if the corresponding index was not visited before the loop started, and remains `None` if the corresponding index was visited before the loop started. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `True` if any of the `bipartite` checks were `True` and `tot` was not 0 for any iteration.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains the same as the initial input integer.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`.
- **`x`, `y`, and `r`**: These lists remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`visited`**: All elements in the `visited` list are `True` because the loop iterates over all indices from 0 to `n-1`, and each iteration sets `visited[i]` to `True` if it was not already.
- **`coef`**: Each element in the `coef` list is set to 1 if the corresponding index was not visited before the loop started. If an index was already visited before the loop, the corresponding `coef` value remains `None`.
- **`tot`**: Remains 0 because `tot` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration of the loop.
- **`bipartite`**: Remains `True` because `bipartite` is reset to `True` at the start of each iteration of the loop.
- **`ok`**: Is `True` if any of the `bipartite` checks were `True` and `tot` was not 0 for any iteration. If none of the iterations met these conditions, `ok` remains `False`.
