Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list remains a list of length `n` where all elements are `False`, and `coef` remains a list of `None` values with length `n`. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list remains a list of length `n` where all elements are `False` except for `visited[0]` which is `True` if `i` is 0. The `coef` list remains a list of `None` values with length `n` except for `coef[0]` which is 1 if `i` is 0. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list remains a list of length `n` where all elements are `False` except for `visited[0]` which is `True`. The `coef` list remains a list of `None` values with length `n` except for `coef[0]` which is 1. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `coef[1]` is also 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is a list of length `n` where `visited[0]` is `True`, and if `visited[2]` was `False` before the if statement, it is now `True`. `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except for `coef[0]` which is 1, and if `visited[2]` was `False` before the if statement, `coef[1]` and `coef[2]` are also 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
