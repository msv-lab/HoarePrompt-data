Precondition: **i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of integers with length n, where x[i] and y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk, and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk. visited is a list of booleans with length n, where visited[i] is False if the i-th disk has not been visited, and True otherwise. tot is a non-negative integer representing the total sum of the coefficients. bipartite is a boolean indicating whether the graph formed by the disks is bipartite. coef is a list of integers with length n, where coef[i] is the coefficient assigned to the i-th disk.**
