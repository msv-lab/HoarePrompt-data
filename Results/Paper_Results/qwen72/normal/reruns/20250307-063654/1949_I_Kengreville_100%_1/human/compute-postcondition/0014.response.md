Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list remains a list of length `n` where all elements are `False`, and `coef` remains a list of `None` values with length `n`. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`.**

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, except that the variable `bipartite` is now set to `True`.
