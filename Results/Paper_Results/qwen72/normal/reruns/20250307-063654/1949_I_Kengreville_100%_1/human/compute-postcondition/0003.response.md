Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `False`, and `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**

The code snippet `r = [None] * n` reinitializes the list `r` to a list of `None` values with length `n`. Therefore, the previous values in `r` (which were integers in the range 1 to 10^9) are no longer valid, and `r` now contains `None` values. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
