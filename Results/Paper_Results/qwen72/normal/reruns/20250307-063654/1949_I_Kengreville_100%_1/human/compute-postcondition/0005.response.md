Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `False`, and `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**

The code snippet `coef = [None] * n` reassigns the `coef` variable to a new list of `None` values with the same length `n`. Since the initial state already specifies that `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, the state of `coef` remains unchanged. All other variables and their states remain the same as in the initial state.
