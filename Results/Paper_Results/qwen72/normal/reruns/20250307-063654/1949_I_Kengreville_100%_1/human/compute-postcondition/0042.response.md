Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`. The `coef` list is a list of length `n` where each element is 1 if the corresponding index was not visited before the loop started, and remains `None` if the corresponding index was visited before the loop started. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `False`.**
