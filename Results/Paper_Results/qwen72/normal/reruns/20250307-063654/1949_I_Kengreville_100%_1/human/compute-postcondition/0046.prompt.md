You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers where each list has length n, and for each i (0 <= i < n), x[i] and y[i] are integers in the range -10^9 to 10^9, and r[i] is an integer in the range 1 to 10^9. visited and coef are lists of length n, initially all elements in visited are False, and coef is initialized with None values.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list remains a list of length `n` where all elements are `False`, and `coef` remains a list of `None` values with length `n`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`. The `coef` list is a list of length `n` where each element is 1 if the corresponding index was not visited before the loop started, and remains `None` if the corresponding index was visited before the loop started. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `True` if any of the `bipartite` checks were `True` and `tot` was not 0 for any iteration.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`. The `coef` list is a list of length `n` where each element is 1 if the corresponding index was not visited before the loop started, and remains `None` if the corresponding index was visited before the loop started. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`. If `ok` is `True`, the program has entered the if condition. If `ok` is `False`, the program has entered the else condition, and `ok` remains `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` based on the integer `n` where 1 <= n <= 1000, and returns a result that is not explicitly defined.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
