Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces.
   - `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`.
   - `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1 if the corresponding index was not visited before the loop started, and remains `None` if the corresponding index was visited before the loop started.
   - `tot` is 0.
   - `bipartite` is `True`.
   - `ok` is `True` if any of the `bipartite` checks were `True` and `tot` was not 0 for any iteration.
   - Additionally, `ok` is `True` and the program has entered the if condition.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The condition for entering this print statement is that `ok` is `True`.
   - According to the initial state, `ok` is `True` if any of the `bipartite` checks were `True` and `tot` was not 0 for any iteration. Additionally, it is given that `ok` is `True` and the program has entered the if condition.

Given that `ok` is `True` and the program has entered the if condition, the `print` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
