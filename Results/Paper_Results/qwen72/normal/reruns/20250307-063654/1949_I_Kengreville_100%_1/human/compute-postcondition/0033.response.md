Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list remains a list of length `n` where all elements are `False` except for `visited[0]` which is `True`. The `coef` list remains a list of `None` values with length `n` except for `coef[0]` which is 1 and `coef[2]` which is 1. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `coef[1]` is also 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `tot = 0` sets the variable `tot` to 0. Since this is the only change, all other initial conditions remain the same.
