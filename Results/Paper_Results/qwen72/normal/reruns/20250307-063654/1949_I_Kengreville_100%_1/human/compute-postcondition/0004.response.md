Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `False`, and `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n`.**

The code `visited = [False] * n` reassigns the `visited` list to a new list of length `n` where all elements are `False`. Since the initial state already specifies that `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `False`, the state of `visited` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
