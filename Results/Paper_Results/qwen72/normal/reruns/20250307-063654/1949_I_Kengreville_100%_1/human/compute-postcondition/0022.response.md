The value of `ok` is updated to be `True` if either `ok` was already `True` or if both `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not equal to 0. Given the initial state, `ok` is `False`, `bipartite` is `True`, and `tot` is 0, the expression `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to `False` (since `tot` is 0). Therefore, `ok` remains `False`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list remains a list of length `n` where all elements are `False` except `visited[0]` which is `True`. `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef[0]` which is 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**
