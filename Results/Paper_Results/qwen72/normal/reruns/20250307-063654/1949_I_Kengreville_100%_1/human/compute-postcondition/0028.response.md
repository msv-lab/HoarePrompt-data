Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The `visited` list remains a list of length `n` where all elements are `False` except for `visited[0]` which is `True`. The `coef` list remains a list of `None` values with length `n` except for `coef[0]` and `coef[1]` which are both 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`. The `dfs` function is called with the argument `i` (which is 1). The exact changes to the state depend on the implementation of the `dfs` function, which is not provided.**

Note: Since the `dfs` function is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it will make to the state. However, the initial state remains as described, and the `dfs` function is called with the argument `i` (which is 1).
