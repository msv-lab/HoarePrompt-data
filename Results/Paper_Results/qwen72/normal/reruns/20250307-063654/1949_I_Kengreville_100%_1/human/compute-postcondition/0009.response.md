The code snippet `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `x[1]`, `y[1]`, and `r[1]` respectively. The value of `i` is 1, so the first elements of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` (i.e., `x[1]`, `y[1]`, and `r[1]`) are updated with the new input values. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 1, `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `x[1]`, `y[1]`, and `r[1]` are assigned the values of three new integers input by the user, split by spaces.**
