Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is assigned the values of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is a list of length `n` where `visited[0]` is `True`, and if `visited[2]` was `False` before the if statement, it is now `True`. `coef` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except for `coef[0]` which is 1, and if `visited[2]` was `False` before the if statement, `coef[1]` and `coef[2]` are also 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.***
