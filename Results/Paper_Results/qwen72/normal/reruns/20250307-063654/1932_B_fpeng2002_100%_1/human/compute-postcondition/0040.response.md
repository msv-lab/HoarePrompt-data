Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n, `num_tests` is 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input for each iteration, `x` is `n-1` for the last iteration, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the product of all elements in `nums` for the last iteration that is greater than or equal to the initial `start_year`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The variable `n` is an integer that was provided as input for each iteration, and it remains within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `a_i` represents the integers provided as input for each iteration, and each `a_i` is within the range 1 to 1,000,000.
- The variable `num_tests` is now 0, indicating that all iterations have completed.
- The variable `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input for each iteration.
- The variable `x` is `n-1` for the last iteration, meaning it has completed its loop over the list `nums`.
- The variable `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the product of all elements in `nums` for the last iteration, and it is greater than or equal to the initial `start_year` value. This value is printed for each iteration of the loop.
