Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0, which is the starting point for calculating the year when the signs occur.
3. **Loop Through Signs**: It iterates through the list of periodicities (`nums`), and for each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year after the previous sign has occurred.
4. **Calculation**: The expression `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. It does this by:
   - Dividing `start_year` by the current periodicity `nums[x]` to find the number of complete cycles that have occurred.
   - Adding 1 to ensure the next cycle starts after the current year.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` to get the next occurrence year.
5. **Output**: After processing all signs, it prints the year when the nth sign occurs.

This approach ensures that the signs occur sequentially and correctly calculates the year when the nth sign will occur, which is the year the apocalypse will happen according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
