To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the following objects:
- `x`: The loop variable.
- `nums`: The list whose length is used to determine the range of the loop.

For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be greater than 0. This means that `nums` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
- `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n.
- `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0.
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input.
- `x` is `n-1`.
- `start_year` is 0.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The only relevant state to adjust is `nums` to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input and must have at least one element, `x` is 0, `start_year` is 0**
