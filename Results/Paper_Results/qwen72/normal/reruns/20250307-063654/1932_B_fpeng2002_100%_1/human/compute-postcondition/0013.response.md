To determine what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `a_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\) for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\).
   - `num_tests` is one less than its initial value.
   - `nums` is a list of \(n\) integers.
   - `x` is \(n-1\).
   - `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the result of the previous iterations.

2. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `nums` is a list of \(n\) integers, where each integer \(a_i\) is between 1 and \(10^6\).
   - `x` is \(n-1\), which means it is the index of the second-to-last element in the list `nums`.
   - `start_year` is defined as the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the result of the previous iterations. This implies that `start_year` is calculated based on some earlier logic or iterations, but the exact value is not provided in the initial state.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(start_year)` statement will output the value of `start_year`.

Since the exact value of `start_year` is not explicitly given in the initial state, we can only describe it based on the provided conditions. The value of `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to some result from previous iterations.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the result of the previous iterations)**
