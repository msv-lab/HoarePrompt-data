The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n, `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
