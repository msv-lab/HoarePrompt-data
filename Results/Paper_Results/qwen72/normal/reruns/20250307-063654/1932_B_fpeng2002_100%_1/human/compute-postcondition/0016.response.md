Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is `n-1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the result of the previous iterations.**

The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer provided by the user input, which must be within the range 1 to 100. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
