Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input and must have at least one element, `x` is 1, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the initial `start_year`.**
