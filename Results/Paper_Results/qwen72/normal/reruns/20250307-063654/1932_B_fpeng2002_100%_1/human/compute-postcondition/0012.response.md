Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is `n-1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the result of the previous iterations.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The value of `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100.
- Each `a_i` remains an integer within the range 1 to 1,000,000.
- The value of `num_tests` is one less than its initial value.
- The list `nums` still contains `n` integers.
- The loop variable `x` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The value of `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` (`nums[n-1]`) that is greater than or equal to the result of the previous iterations of the loop. This result is the cumulative effect of aligning `start_year` to be a multiple of each element in `nums` in sequence.
