Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `x` is `n-1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[n-1]` that is greater than or equal to the result of the previous iterations.**

Explanation:
- The code `num_tests -= 1` decrements the value of `num_tests` by 1.
- The initial state specifies that `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0. After decrementing, `num_tests` is now two less than its initial value but still must be greater than 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_i`, `nums`, `x`, `start_year`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
