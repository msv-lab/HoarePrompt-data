### Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the number of signs and their periodicities, and then calculates the year when the n-th sign will occur.

The key part of the program is the loop where `start_year` is updated for each sign. The logic for updating `start_year` is:

```python
start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```

This line ensures that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`. This is correct because:

1. **Initial Year Calculation**: When `start_year` is 0, the first sign will occur in the year `nums[0]`.
2. **Subsequent Year Calculation**: For each subsequent sign, the program finds the next multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the year when the previous sign occurred. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the first test case from the example:

- **Input**: `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- **Initial `start_year`**: 0
- **First sign (3)**: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
- **Second sign (2)**: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
- **Third sign (4)**: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
- **Fourth sign (5)**: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
- **Fifth sign (9)**: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
- **Sixth sign (18)**: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Sign**: If there is only one sign, the program correctly outputs the periodicity of that sign.
- **All Signs with Periodicity 1**: If all signs have a periodicity of 1, the program correctly outputs `n` (the number of signs) because each sign will occur in the next year.
- **Large Periodicities**: The program handles large periodicities (up to \(10^6\)) correctly by finding the smallest multiple of each periodicity that is greater than the current `start_year`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It processes the input as specified, calculates the year when the n-th sign will occur, and prints the correct output for each test case.
