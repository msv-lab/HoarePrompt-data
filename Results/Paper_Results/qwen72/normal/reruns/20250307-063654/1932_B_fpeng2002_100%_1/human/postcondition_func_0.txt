The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It calculates the smallest multiple of each element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the initial `start_year` (which is 0) and prints this value. After processing all test cases, `num_tests` is 0, and the function has no return value. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, or `nums`.
