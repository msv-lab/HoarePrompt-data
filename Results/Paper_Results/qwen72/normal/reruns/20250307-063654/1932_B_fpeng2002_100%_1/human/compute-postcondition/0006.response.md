The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value, but this does not affect the loop's execution. Similarly, the values of `t`, `n`, `a_i`, and `start_year` do not directly impact the loop's execution.

For the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least 1 element, and `x` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is 0, `start_year` is 0**
