The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, and `nums` must still have at least 2 elements (since `x` will be 2).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to `nums[0]`.**
