Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicity of each sign and the requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the number of signs and their periodicities. It calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur by iterating through the list of periodicities and updating the `start_year` to the next multiple of the current periodicity that is greater than the current `start_year`.

The key part of the program is the line:
```python
start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```
This line ensures that `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than the current `start_year`. This is correct because:
- `start_year // nums[x]` gives the largest integer k such that `k * nums[x]` is less than or equal to `start_year`.
- Adding 1 to `start_year // nums[x]` ensures that we move to the next multiple.
- Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

This logic correctly implements the requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The program also correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the result for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
