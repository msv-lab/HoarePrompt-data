Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the signs occur with periodicities that are not multiples of each other. Specifically, the logic for calculating the next year in which a sign occurs is flawed. The line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not ensure that the signs occur strictly after the previous sign, as required by the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
2 3 4
```
The expected output should be 12, because:
- The first sign occurs in year 2.
- The second sign occurs in year 3, but the tribe will wait for it to occur in year 4 (the next multiple of 3 after 2).
- The third sign occurs in year 4, but the tribe will wait for it to occur in year 8 (the next multiple of 4 after 4).
- The fourth sign occurs in year 12 (the next multiple of 4 after 8).

However, the program will output 8, which is incorrect.
