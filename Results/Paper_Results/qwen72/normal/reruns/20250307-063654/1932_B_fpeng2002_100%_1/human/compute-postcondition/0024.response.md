Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i from 1 to n, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input and must have at least two elements, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the initial `start_year`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` updates the value of `start_year` to the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the initial `start_year`.
- The value of `x` is 2, so `nums[x]` is `nums[2]`.
- The expression `(start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]` calculates the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_i`, `num_tests`, `nums`, `x`) remain unchanged.
