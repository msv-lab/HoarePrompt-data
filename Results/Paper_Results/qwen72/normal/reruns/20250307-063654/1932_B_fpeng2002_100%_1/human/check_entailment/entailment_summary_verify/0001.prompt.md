You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It calculates the smallest multiple of each element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the initial `start_year` (which is 0) and prints this value. After processing all test cases, `num_tests` is 0, and the function has no return value. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, or `nums`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Description:
- The Chaya tribe believes there are \( n \) signs of the apocalypse.
- The \( i \)-th sign occurs every \( a_i \) years.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning if the \( i \)-th sign occurs in year \( x \), the tribe starts waiting for the \( (i+1) \)-th sign from year \( x+1 \).
- We need to find the year in which the \( n \)-th sign occurs, which will be the year of the apocalypse.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs \( n \) and the periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) using `int(input())` and `[int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the year in which the current sign occurs.

3. **Sign Occurrence Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the list of periodicities `nums` using a for loop.
   - For each periodicity \( a_i \), it calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the current `start_year` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{start_year} = (\text{start_year} // a_i + 1) \times a_i
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is the smallest multiple of \( a_i \) that is greater than the current `start_year`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which is the year in which the \( n \)-th sign occurs.

### Verification:
- **First Test Case:**
  - \( n = 6 \)
  - \( a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18] \)
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - For \( a_1 = 3 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (0 // 3 + 1) \times 3 = 3
    \]
  - For \( a_2 = 2 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (3 // 2 + 1) \times 2 = 4
    \]
  - For \( a_3 = 4 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (4 // 4 + 1) \times 4 = 8
    \]
  - For \( a_4 = 5 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (8 // 5 + 1) \times 5 = 10
    \]
  - For \( a_5 = 9 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (10 // 9 + 1) \times 9 = 18
    \]
  - For \( a_6 = 18 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (18 // 18 + 1) \times 18 = 36
    \]
  - The program correctly outputs 36.

- **Second Test Case:**
  - \( n = 5 \)
  - \( a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \)
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - For \( a_1 = 1 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (0 // 1 + 1) \times 1 = 1
    \]
  - For \( a_2 = 2 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (1 // 2 + 1) \times 2 = 2
    \]
  - For \( a_3 = 3 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (2 // 3 + 1) \times 3 = 3
    \]
  - For \( a_4 = 4 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (3 // 4 + 1) \times 4 = 4
    \]
  - For \( a_5 = 5 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (4 // 5 + 1) \times 5 = 5
    \]
  - The program correctly outputs 5.

- **Third Test Case:**
  - \( n = 5 \)
  - \( a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \)
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - For \( a_1 = 1 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (0 // 1 + 1) \times 1 = 1
    \]
  - For \( a_2 = 1 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (1 // 1 + 1) \times 1 = 2
    \]
  - For \( a_3 = 1 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (2 // 1 + 1) \times 1 = 3
    \]
  - For \( a_4 = 1 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (3 // 1 + 1) \times 1 = 4
    \]
  - For \( a_5 = 1 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (4 // 1 + 1) \times 1 = 5
    \]
  - The program correctly outputs 5.

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - \( n = 6 \)
  - \( a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006] \)
  - Initial `start_year = 0`
  - For \( a_1 = 50 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (0 // 50 + 1) \times 50 = 50
    \]
  - For \( a_2 = 30 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (50 // 30 + 1) \times 30 = 60
    \]
  - For \( a_3 = 711 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (60 // 711 + 1) \times 711 = 711
    \]
  - For \( a_4 = 200 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (711 // 200 + 1) \times 200 = 800
    \]
  - For \( a_5 = 503 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (800 // 503 + 1) \times 503 = 1006
    \]
  - For \( a_6 = 1006 \):
    \[
    \text{start_year} = (1006 // 1006 + 1) \times 1006 = 2012
    \]
  - The program correctly outputs 2012.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the \( n \)-th sign occurs, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula used in the loop correctly calculates the next occurrence of each sign.
