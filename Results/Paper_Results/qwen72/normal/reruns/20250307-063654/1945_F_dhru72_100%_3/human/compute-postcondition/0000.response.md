Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `v` is a list of n integers where 1 <= v_i <= 10^9, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and `T` is a TypeVar. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
