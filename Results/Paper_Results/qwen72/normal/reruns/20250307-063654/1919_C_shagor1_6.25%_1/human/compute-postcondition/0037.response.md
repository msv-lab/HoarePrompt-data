Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp` (if `inp` has at least two distinct elements), and `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**

Explanation:
- The code `*inp, = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `inp`.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain as they were in the initial state, but `inp` is now a list of integers entered by the user.
- The condition that `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `_` and `n` is the new input integer still holds.
- `x` and `y` will be recalculated based on the new values in `inp`, and `ans` will be recalculated based on the new values of `x` and `y` and the contents of `inp`.
