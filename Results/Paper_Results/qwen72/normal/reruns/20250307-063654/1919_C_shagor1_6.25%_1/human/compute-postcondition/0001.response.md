Output State: **`_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `_` is in the range of `int(input())`, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. These conditions remain unchanged.
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. Since `int(input())` is an input from the user, `n` is now an input integer.
