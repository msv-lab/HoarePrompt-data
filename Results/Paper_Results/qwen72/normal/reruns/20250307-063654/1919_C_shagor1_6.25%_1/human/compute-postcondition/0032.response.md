Postcondition: **`_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`, and `ans` is 0 or 1 based on the conditions given. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is determined by the conditions given, and `ans` remains 0 or 1 based on the conditions given. If `a` is greater than `x`, `y` is equal to `a`, and `ans` is increased by 1 while `x` remains unchanged.**
