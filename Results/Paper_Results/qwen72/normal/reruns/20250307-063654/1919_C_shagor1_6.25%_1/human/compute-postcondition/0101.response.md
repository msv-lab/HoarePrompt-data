Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three integers, `a` is the third integer in the list `inp`, `y` is `a`. If `a` <= `n + 1`, then `x` is `a` and `ans` is 0. If `a` > `n + 1` and `a` <= `x`, then `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, and `ans` is 1. If `a` > `n + 1` and `a` > `x`, then `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, and `ans` is 2. If `a` > `y` and `a` <= `n + 1`, then `x` is `a` and `ans` is 1. If `a` > `y` and `a` > `n + 1` and `a` <= `x`, then `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, and `ans` is 2. If `a` > `y` and `a` > `n + 1` and `a` > `x`, then `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, and `ans` is 3.**
