Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `inp`, `x` is the second element of `inp`, `y` is the second element of `inp`, `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 2, and `x` is not equal to `y`. The expression `x == y` evaluates to `True` if `ans` is 1, and `False` if `ans` is 2.**
