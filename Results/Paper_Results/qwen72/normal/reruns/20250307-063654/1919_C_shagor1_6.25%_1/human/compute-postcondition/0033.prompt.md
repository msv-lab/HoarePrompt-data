Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to `n + 1`, `y` is equal to `n + 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `x` is equal to `a` and `y` is equal to `n + 1`, and `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `x` is equal to `n + 1` and `y` is equal to `a`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `x` is equal to `a` and `y` is equal to `n + 1`, and `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `x` is equal to `n + 1` and `y` is equal to `a`, and `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`, and `ans` is 0 or 1 based on the conditions given. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is determined by the conditions given, and `ans` remains 0 or 1 based on the conditions given. If `a` is greater than `x`, `y` is equal to `a`, and `ans` is increased by 1 while `x` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
