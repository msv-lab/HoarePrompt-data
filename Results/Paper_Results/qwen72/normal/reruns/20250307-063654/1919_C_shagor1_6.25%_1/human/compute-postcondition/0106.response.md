The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, and a list of integers `a` containing `n` elements. The function also accepts an integer `t` representing the total number of test cases. The function returns the result for each test case based on the processing of the array `a` for each `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of size `n`. It returns the result of processing the array `a` for each test case. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 2·10^5, or if any element `a_i` in `a` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, the behavior is undefined. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
