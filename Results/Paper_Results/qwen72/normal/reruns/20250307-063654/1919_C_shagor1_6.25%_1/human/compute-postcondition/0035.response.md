The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `_` is still in the range of `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is in the range of `int(input())`, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must increment by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

However, since `int(input())` is an input that is typically not changed within the loop, we assume it remains constant. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `_`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp` (if `inp` has at least two distinct elements), and `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**
