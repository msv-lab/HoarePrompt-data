Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are both `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user.** 

The value of `ans` is reset to 0, but the values of `_`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `inp` remain unchanged. If all integers in `inp` are the same, `x` and `y` will both be `n + 1`, and `ans` will be 0.
