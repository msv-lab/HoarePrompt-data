Postcondition: **`_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `n + 1`, `y` is equal to `a`, `a` is the first element of `inp`, and `a` is greater than `x`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `x` is not equal to `y`.**
