Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is a positive integer (this is the length of the list `inp`).
- `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `x` is the smallest integer in the list `inp`.
- `y` is the second smallest integer in the list `inp`.
- `ans` is the number of integers in the list `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is the smallest integer in the list `inp`.
   - `y` is the second smallest integer in the list `inp`.

2. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the count of integers in the list `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.
   - This means we need to count how many elements in `inp` are greater than the second smallest element `y`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`.

### Explanation:
- Since `x` is the smallest integer and `y` is the second smallest, any integer in `inp` that is greater than `y` is also greater than `x`.
- Therefore, `ans` will be the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than the second smallest element `y`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the number of integers in the list inp that are greater than both x and y)**
