Output State: **`_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `n + 1`, `y` is equal to `a`, `ans` is 1, `a` is the first element of `inp`, and `a` is greater than `n + 1`. The comparison `x == y` evaluates to `False`.**
