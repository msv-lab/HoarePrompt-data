Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`, `y` is the third element of `inp`, `x` is the third element of `inp`, `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 2, and `x` is not equal to `y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is assigned to be the third element of `inp`, which is `a`.
- The values of `_`, `n`, and `inp` remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is set to the third element of `inp`, which is `a`.
- The value of `ans` is determined based on the condition: if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `ans` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is 2, and `x` is not equal to `y`.
