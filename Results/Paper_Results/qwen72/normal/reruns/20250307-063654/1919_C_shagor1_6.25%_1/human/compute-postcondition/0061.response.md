Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`, `x` is the third element of `inp`, `y` is `n + 1`, and `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1 and `x` is not equal to `y`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is set to the third element of `inp`, which is `a`.
- The conditions and values for `_`, `n`, `inp`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The values of `y` and `ans` are determined based on the comparison between `a` and `n + 1`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `y` is `n + 1` and `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 1, and `x` is not equal to `y`.
