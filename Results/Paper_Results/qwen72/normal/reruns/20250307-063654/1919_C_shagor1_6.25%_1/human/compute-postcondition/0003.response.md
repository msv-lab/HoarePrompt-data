Output State: **`_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to `n + 1`, `y` is equal to `n + 1`**

The variables `x` and `y` are both assigned the value of `n + 1`, where `n` is an input integer. The initial conditions for `_` and `int(input())` remain unchanged, and `inp` is still a list of integers entered by the user.
