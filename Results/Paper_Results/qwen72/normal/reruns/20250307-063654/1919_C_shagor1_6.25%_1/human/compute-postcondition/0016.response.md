Postcondition: **`_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `x` is equal to `a` and `y` is equal to `n + 1`, and `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `x` is equal to `n + 1` and `y` is equal to `a`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.**
