Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are the two smallest distinct integers in `inp` (if they exist), and `ans` is the count of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`. If all integers in `inp` are the same, `x` and `y` will both be that integer, and `ans` will be 0.**
