Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1. `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one integer, and `a` is the first integer in the list `inp`. `a` is greater than `x` in both cases.***
