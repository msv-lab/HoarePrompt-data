Output State: **`_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `inp`. `y` is now equal to `a`. `x` is equal to `n + 1` if `a` is greater than `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is equal to `a`. `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 2. The expression `x == y` is evaluated, but it does not change any variables.**
