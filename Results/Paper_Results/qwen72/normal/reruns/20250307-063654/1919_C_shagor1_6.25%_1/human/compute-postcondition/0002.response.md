Output State: **`_` is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user.** 

The code snippet `*inp, = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting integers to the list `inp`. The values of `_`, `int(input())`, and `n` remain unchanged.
