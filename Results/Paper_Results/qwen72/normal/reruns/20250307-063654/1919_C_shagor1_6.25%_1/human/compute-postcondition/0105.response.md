Output State: **_ is equal to `int(input())`, `n` is a positive integer, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the smallest integer in the list `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in the list `inp` (if they exist), and `ans` is the number of integers in the list `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `_` will be equal to the total number of test cases specified by `int(input())`. For each test case, the loop reads an integer `n` which represents the size of the array `inp`, and `inp` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user. The variables `x` and `y` are updated to be the smallest and second smallest integers in `inp`, respectively, if they exist. If all integers in `inp` are the same, both `x` and `y` will be that integer. The variable `ans` is the count of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`. This process repeats for each test case until all test cases have been processed.
