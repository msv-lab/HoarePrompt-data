Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array a, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    *inp, = map(int, input().split())
    x = y = n + 1
    ans = 0
    for a in inp:
        if a <= x:
            x = a
        elif a <= y:
            y = a
        else:
            x == y
            y = a
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is in the range of `int(input())`, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp` (if `inp` has at least two distinct elements), and `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `inp`, `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is the new input integer, `x` and `y` are the two smallest distinct integers in `inp` (if they exist), and `ans` is the count of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`. If all integers in `inp` are the same, `x` and `y` will both be that integer, and `ans` will be 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 0, n is a positive integer, inp is a list of integers provided by the user, x is the smallest integer in the list inp, y is the second smallest integer in the list inp, and ans is the number of integers in the list inp that are greater than both x and y.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
