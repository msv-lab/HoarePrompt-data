Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, and `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.**

Explanation:
- `_` is incremented by 1, and this remains unchanged.
- `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `_`, and this condition still holds.
- `n` is the new input integer, and this remains unchanged.
- `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user, and this remains unchanged.
- `x` and `y` are both assigned the value `n + 1`.
- `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`, and this remains unchanged.
