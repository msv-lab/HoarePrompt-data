Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two integers, `a` is the second integer in the list `inp`. If `a` <= `n + 1`, then `x` is `a` and `y` is `n + 1`, and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, and `ans` is 1. `y` is now equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated to be equal to `a`. The conditions and other variable values remain unchanged.
