Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then determines the number of integers in `a` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest integers in the list. The function prints this count for each test case. The function does not return any value. If the input values do not meet the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5), the behavior of the function is undefined. **
