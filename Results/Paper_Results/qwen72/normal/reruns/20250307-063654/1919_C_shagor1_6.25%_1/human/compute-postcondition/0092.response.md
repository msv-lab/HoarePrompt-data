Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two integers, `a` is the second integer in the list `inp`. If `a` <= `n + 1`, then `x` is `a` and `y` is `n + 1`, and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, and `ans` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `ans` was initially 0, so now it is 1.
- If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, `ans` was initially 1, so now it is 2.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `inp`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
