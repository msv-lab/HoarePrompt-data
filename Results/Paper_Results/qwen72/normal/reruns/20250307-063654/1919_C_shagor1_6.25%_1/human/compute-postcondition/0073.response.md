Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are both `n + 1`, `ans` is the count of integers in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`. If all integers in `inp` are the same, `x` and `y` will both be `n + 1`, and `ans` will be 0. `inp` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
