Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers entered by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`, `y` is `n + 1`, `x` is the third element of `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `n + 1` and `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is 1. If `a` is greater than `n + 1` and `a` is greater than `y`, `ans` is 2. If `a` is greater than `n + 1` and `a` is greater than `y`, `ans` is 3, and `x` is not equal to `y`.**
