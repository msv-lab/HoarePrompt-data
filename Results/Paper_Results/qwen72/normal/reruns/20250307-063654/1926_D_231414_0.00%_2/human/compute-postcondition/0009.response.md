Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one integer, `i` is the first integer in `data`, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647, `s` is the result of `i` XOR 2147483647.**

Explanation:
- `s` is assigned the value of `i` XOR `check`.
- `i` is the first integer in `data`.
- `check` is 2147483647.
- The value of `s` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and 2147483647.
- All other variables (`times`, `n`, `data`, `i`, `dic`, `ans`, `check`) remain unchanged.
