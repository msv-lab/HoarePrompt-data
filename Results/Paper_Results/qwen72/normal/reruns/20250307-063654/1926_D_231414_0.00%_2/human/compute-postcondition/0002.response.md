The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `times`. For the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other variables and conditions provided (`t`, `n`, `a`, `check`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0**
