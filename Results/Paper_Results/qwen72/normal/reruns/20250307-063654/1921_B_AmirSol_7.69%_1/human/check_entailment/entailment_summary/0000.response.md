Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of the boxes (string `s1`) into the desired state (string `s2`). The operations allowed are:
1. Adding a cat to an empty box.
2. Removing a cat from a box.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The function `func_1` iterates through the strings `s1` and `s2` to count the number of positions where they differ. The function also includes a special rule: if two consecutive positions differ and the characters at these positions in `s1` are different, it counts them as a single operation. This is because moving a cat from one box to the next can resolve both differences in one step.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a counter to 0 and an index `i` to 0.
2. **Iteration**: The function iterates through the strings using a while loop.
3. **Difference Check**: If the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` differ, it checks if the next position `i + 1` also differs and if the characters at positions `i` and `i + 1` in `s1` are different.
   - If both conditions are met, it increments the counter by 1 and skips the next position (`i += 2`).
   - If not, it increments the counter by 1 and moves to the next position (`i += 1`).
4. **No Difference**: If the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` are the same, it simply moves to the next position (`i += 1`).
5. **Return**: After the loop, the function returns the counter, which represents the minimum number of operations required.

This logic is correct because:
- It correctly identifies the positions where the initial and desired states differ.
- It optimizes the count by considering consecutive differences that can be resolved in a single move.

The function `func_1` is called for each test case, and the results are printed as required by the problem statement.

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the required logic and produce the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
