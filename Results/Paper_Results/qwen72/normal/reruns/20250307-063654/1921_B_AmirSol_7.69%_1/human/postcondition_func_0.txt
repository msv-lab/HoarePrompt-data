The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It returns the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, with a special rule: if two consecutive positions differ and the characters at these positions in `s1` are also different, they are counted as a single difference. After the function concludes, `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `s1` and `s2` are unchanged.
