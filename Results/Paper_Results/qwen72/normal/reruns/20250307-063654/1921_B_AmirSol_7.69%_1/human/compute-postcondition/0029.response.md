Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and `n` must be greater than 3. If `s1[i] != s2[i]`, then `counter` is 1, 2, or 3. If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i] != s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is 5. Otherwise, `i` is 4, 3, or 4. If `s1[i] == s2[i]`, then `counter` is 0, 1, or 2 and `i` is 4.***
