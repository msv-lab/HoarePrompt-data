Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 1, 2, or 3, `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 2, so `i` becomes 5. The other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `counter`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
