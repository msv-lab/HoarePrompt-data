Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0, and the characters at the first position of `s1` and `s2` are different. Additionally, either `i` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`.**
