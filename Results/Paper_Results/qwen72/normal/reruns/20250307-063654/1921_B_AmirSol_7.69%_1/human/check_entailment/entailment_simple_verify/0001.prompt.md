You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the reasoning step by step to determine if the given Python program is correct for the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
- We have `n` boxes, and each box can either contain a cat ('1') or not ('0').
- We are given an initial state `s1` and a desired state `s2` of the boxes.
- We can perform three types of operations:
  1. Place a new cat in a box.
  2. Remove a cat from a box.
  3. Move a cat from one box to another.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s1`, and the desired state `s2`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (number of boxes), `s1` (initial state), and `s2` (desired state).
   - It initializes a counter `counter` to 0 and an index `i` to 0.
   - It iterates through the boxes from 0 to `n-1` using a while loop.
   - For each box, it checks if the current state `s1[i]` is different from the desired state `s2[i]`.
     - If `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, it further checks if the next box (`s1[i+1]`) is also different from `s2[i+1]` and if `s1[i]` is different from `s1[i+1]`.
       - If both conditions are true, it increments the counter by 1 and skips the next box by incrementing `i` by 2.
       - If the conditions are not true, it increments the counter by 1 and moves to the next box by incrementing `i` by 1.
     - If `s1[i]` is the same as `s2[i]`, it simply moves to the next box by incrementing `i` by 1.
   - Finally, it returns the counter.

### Correctness Check:
- **Handling Different States:**
  - The program correctly identifies when the current state `s1[i]` is different from the desired state `s2[i]`.
  - If the current box and the next box both need to be changed and the current box and the next box have different states, it performs a single operation to move a cat between these two boxes.
  - If only one box needs to be changed, it performs a single operation to either add or remove a cat.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where the number of boxes `n` is 1 correctly.
  - It also handles the case where the initial and desired states are the same, returning 0 as expected.

- **Optimality:**
  - The program ensures that it performs the minimum number of operations by trying to move cats between adjacent boxes whenever possible, which is an optimal strategy.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Initial: `10010`
  - Desired: `00001`
  - Steps: Move cat from box 1 to box 5, then remove cat from box 4.
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Initial: `1`
  - Desired: `1`
  - Steps: No changes needed.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Initial: `000`
  - Desired: `111`
  - Steps: Place a cat in each box.
  - Output: `3` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Initial: `0101`
  - Desired: `1010`
  - Steps: Move cat from box 2 to box 1, then move cat from box 4 to box 3.
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Initial: `100`
  - Desired: `101`
  - Steps: Place a cat in box 3.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Initial: `10011001`
  - Desired: `11111110`
  - Steps: Move cat from box 2 to box 1, move cat from box 4 to box 3, move cat from box 6 to box 5, move cat from box 8 to box 7.
  - Output: `4` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the optimal strategy to minimize the number of operations. Therefore, the program is correct.
