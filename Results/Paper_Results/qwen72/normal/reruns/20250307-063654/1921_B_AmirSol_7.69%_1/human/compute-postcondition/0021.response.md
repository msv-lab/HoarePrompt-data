Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, 1, or 2, and `n` must be greater than `i`. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then: if `i` is less than `n - 1`, `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is 3 or 4. Otherwise, `i` is 2 or 3. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `i` is 3.***
