Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters. If the characters at the first position of `s1` and `s2` are different, `counter` is 1, and `i` is 1. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and the characters at the second position of `s1` and `s2` are different, and the characters at the first and second positions of `s1` are different, then `i` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and either `i` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, or the characters at the second position of `s1` and `s2` are the same, or the characters at the first and second positions of `s1` are the same. If the characters at the first position of `s1` and `s2` are the same, `counter` is 0, and `i` is 1.***
