Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is 1 or 2, and `n` must be greater than `i`.** 

The value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
