The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The function returns the number of positions where the strings `s1` and `s2` differ.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and returns the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ.**
