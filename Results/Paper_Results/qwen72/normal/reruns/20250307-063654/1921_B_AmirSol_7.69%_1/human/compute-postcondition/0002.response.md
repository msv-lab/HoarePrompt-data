The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < n`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5. Since `n` is already a positive integer and `i` is 0, the condition `i < n` is already satisfied, and the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
