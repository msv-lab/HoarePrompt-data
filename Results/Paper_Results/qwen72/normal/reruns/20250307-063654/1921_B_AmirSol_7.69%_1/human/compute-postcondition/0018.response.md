Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is 2 or 3, and `n` must be greater than `i`.** 

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so if it was 1, it is now 2, and if it was 2, it is now 3. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
