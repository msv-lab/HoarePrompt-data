Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 0 or 1, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than `i`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 1, it is now 2, and if `i` was 2, it is now 3. Since `n` must be greater than `i`, and `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3. The other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `counter`) remain unchanged.
