Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) into the desired state (`s2`). The logic in `func_1` is as follows:

1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of operations.
2. Iterate through the boxes from left to right.
3. If the current box in `s1` does not match the corresponding box in `s2`:
   - Check if the next box also needs to be changed and if the current and next boxes are different (one has a cat and the other does not).
   - If so, perform a single operation to move the cat to the correct position and skip the next box.
   - Otherwise, perform an operation to either add or remove a cat from the current box.
4. If the current box in `s1` matches the corresponding box in `s2`, move to the next box.
5. Return the total number of operations.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is used by taking advantage of the possibility to move a cat from one incorrect position to another in a single operation when applicable. The program handles all the test cases correctly and efficiently, given the constraints.
