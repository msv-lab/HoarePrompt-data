Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is 3 or 4, and `n` must be greater than `i`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since the initial value of `i` was 1 or 2, after the increment, `i` becomes 3 or 4. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
