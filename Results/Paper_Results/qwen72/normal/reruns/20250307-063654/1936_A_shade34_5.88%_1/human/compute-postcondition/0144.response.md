To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`n`**: This is the input integer.
2. **`i`**: This is `n-1`.
3. **`pans`**: This is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<'.
4. **`mak`**: This is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the user input was '>'.
5. **`mak2`**: This is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.

Now, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```
print('!', mak2, mak)
```

- **`mak2`**: This variable holds the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. This means `mak2` is the largest index in the range from 1 to `n-1` where the user input was '<'.
- **`mak`**: This variable holds the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the user input was '>'. Since `pans` is a list of integers, `mak` is the index of the largest integer in `pans` where the user input was '>', not the value itself.

Given the initial state, the `print` statement will output the character '!' followed by the values of `mak2` and `mak`.

Output: **! [mak2] [mak] (where [mak2] is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and [mak] is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the user input was '>')**
