Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0 or 1 depending on the user input.** 

The output buffer has been flushed again, but this does not change the state of the variables. The value of `mak` remains 0 or 1 based on the user input, and the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
