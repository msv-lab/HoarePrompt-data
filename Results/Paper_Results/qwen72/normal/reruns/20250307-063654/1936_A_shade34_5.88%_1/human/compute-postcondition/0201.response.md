Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, but it is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak` (which was the largest index `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'). Since `mak` is 0, `mak2` is also 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements. Let's denote the elements of `pans` as `pans[0]` and `pans[1]`.

4. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - It will then print `pans[mak]` twice, which is `pans[0]` twice.
   - It will then print `pans[i]` twice, which is `pans[1]` twice.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the list `pans` and [pans[1]] is the second element of the list `pans`)**
