The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `pans`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, and `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements. The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to the length of `pans` (exclusive), so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the length of `pans` must be greater than `i`.

Since `i` is `n-1` at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n`. For the loop to execute again, `len(pans)` must be greater than `n`.

State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements, `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on the user input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is '>', `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
