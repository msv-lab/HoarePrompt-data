Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' and must have at least 2 elements.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
