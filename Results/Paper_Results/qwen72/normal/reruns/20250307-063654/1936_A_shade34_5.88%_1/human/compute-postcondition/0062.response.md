Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 1 if the user input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' and must have at least 3 elements.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` has no impact on the values of the variables, but it ensures that the output buffer is flushed. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
