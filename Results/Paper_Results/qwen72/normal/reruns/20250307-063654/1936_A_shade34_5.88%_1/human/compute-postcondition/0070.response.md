Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was '>', otherwise `mak` remains the index of the first element where the user input was '>', `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' and must have at least `len(pans)` elements.**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` is the last index of the `pans` list, which is `len(pans) - 1`.
- The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration.
- `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was '>', or it remains the index of the first element where the user input was '>' if no further '>' inputs were received.
- `mak2` remains 0.
- `pans` is a list that contains all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' and must have at least as many elements as the length of `pans`.
