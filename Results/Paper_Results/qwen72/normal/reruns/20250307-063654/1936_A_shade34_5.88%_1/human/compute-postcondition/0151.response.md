Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<', `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
