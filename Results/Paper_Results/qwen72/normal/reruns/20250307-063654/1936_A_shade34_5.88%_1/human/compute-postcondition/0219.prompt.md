Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. Each query involves four indices (a, b, c, d) where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n. The output of each query is either "<", ">", or "=". The function must terminate immediately if it makes more than 3n queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, mak)
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was '>', otherwise `mak` remains the index of the first element where the user input was '>', `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' and must have at least `len(pans)` elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<', `mak` is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the user input was '>', `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `mak2` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest index `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `len(pans)`) for which the user input was '>', or 0 if no such input was provided.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
