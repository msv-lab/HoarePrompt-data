The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `pans`. The loop iterates over the indices of `pans` starting from 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range of the list `pans`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the input integer.
- `i` is `n`.
- `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements.
- `mak` is 0 or `n` depending on the user input.
- `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `pans` must have at least `n+2` elements to ensure that `i` is within the range of `pans` (since the loop starts from 1).

State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n+1`, `pans` is a list containing at least `n+2` elements, `mak` is 0 or `n` depending on the user input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**
