Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is [1] if `s` is not equal to '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is [0, 1]. `mak` is 2, `mak2` is equal to `mak`. `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '<'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `mak`. Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak2` also becomes 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
