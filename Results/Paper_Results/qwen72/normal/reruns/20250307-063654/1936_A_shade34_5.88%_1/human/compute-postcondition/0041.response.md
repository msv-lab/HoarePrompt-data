Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed. `s` is the input string. If `s` is '<', `mak` and `mak2` are both 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`. If `s` is not '<' and not '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', if no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. If `s` is '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', if no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.***
