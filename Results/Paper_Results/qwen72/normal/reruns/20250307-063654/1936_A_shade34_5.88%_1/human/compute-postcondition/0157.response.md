Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<', `mak` is 1 if the user input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the fact that the output buffer has been flushed.
