Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `mak`. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, `mak` is now 3, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
