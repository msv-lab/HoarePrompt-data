Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<'.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will print the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `mak` (which is 0), then again the value of `mak` (which is 0), followed by the value of `i` (which is 1), and then again the value of `i` (which is 1).

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
