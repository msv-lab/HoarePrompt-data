Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. If no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`. `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not equal to '='. If `s` is equal to '=', `pans` is a list containing the integer 0, and `s` is the user input string.***
