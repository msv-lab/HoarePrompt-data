The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and the output buffer has been flushed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that is equal to '<', `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
