The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. The loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<', `mak` is 2 if the user input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**
