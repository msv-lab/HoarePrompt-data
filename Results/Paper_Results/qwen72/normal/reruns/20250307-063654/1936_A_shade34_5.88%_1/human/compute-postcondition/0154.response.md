Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<', `mak` is 1 if the user input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.***
