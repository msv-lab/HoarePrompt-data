Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `pans` is an empty list, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and the output buffer has been flushed**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
