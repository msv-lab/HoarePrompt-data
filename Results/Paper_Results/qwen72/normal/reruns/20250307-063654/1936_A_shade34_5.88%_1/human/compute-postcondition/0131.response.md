Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed. The user input is '>'**

Explanation:
- `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n-1`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `pans`, `mak2`, and the user input remain unchanged.
- The output buffer has already been flushed, so this information is still valid.
