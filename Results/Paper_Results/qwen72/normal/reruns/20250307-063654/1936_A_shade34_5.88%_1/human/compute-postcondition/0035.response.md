Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `s` is '<', `mak` and `mak2` are both 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[0]`.
   - If `s` is not '<' and not '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', if no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is an empty list.
   - If `s` is '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', if no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing the integer 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print a question mark followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.
   - We need to determine the values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` based on the initial state.

4. **Values Based on Initial State:**
   - `i` is always 1.
   - `mak2` is always equal to `mak`.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the value of `s`:
     - If `s` is '<', `mak` is 0.
     - If `s` is not '<' and not '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no user input was '<'.
     - If `s` is '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no user input was '<'.

5. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If `s` is '<':
     - `mak` is 0.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - `i` is 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 1 0`.
   - If `s` is not '<' and not '=':
     - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no user input was '<'.
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - `i` is 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak]` (where `[mak]` is the value of `mak`).
   - If `s` is '=':
     - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no user input was '<'.
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - `i` is 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak]` (where `[mak]` is the value of `mak`).

6. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `mak` depends on the user input, we can only describe it in terms of the given conditions.
   - The most precise description based on the initial state is:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer i (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no user input was '<')**
