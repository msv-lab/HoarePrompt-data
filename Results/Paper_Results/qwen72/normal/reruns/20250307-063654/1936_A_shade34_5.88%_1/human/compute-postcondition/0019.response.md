Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. If no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is greater than 0.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `n-1`, which is the last value it takes in the loop.
- The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration.
- The variable `mak` holds the largest integer `i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user input was '<'. If no user input was ever '<', `mak` remains 0.
