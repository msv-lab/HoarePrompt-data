Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. If no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`. `pans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `pans` as an empty list, and the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
