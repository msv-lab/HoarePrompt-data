Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<', `mak` is 3, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation:
- `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `pans`, and `mak2` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 3, and the state of the output buffer being flushed, also remain unchanged.
