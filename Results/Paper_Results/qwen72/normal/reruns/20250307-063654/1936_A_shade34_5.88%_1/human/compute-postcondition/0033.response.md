Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is '<', `mak` and `mak2` are both 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. If `s` is not '<' and not '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', if no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is an empty list. If `s` is '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', if no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing the integer 0.***
