Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, so it is irrelevant for this task).
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` must have at least 4 elements (so `pans` is a list with at least 4 elements).
   - `mak2` is 0 (but it is not used in the print statement).
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is a system state and does not affect the print statement directly).
   - If the user input is '>', `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 or 1 depending on the user input.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first element printed is the string `'?'`.
   - The next two elements printed are `pans[mak]` and `pans[mak]`, which means the value at index `mak` in the list `pans` is printed twice.
   - The last two elements printed are `pans[i]` and `pans[i]`, which means the value at index 3 in the list `pans` is printed twice.

4. **Possible Values of `mak`:**
   - If the user input is '>', `mak` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `mak` is 0 or 1 depending on the user input.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `mak` is 2, the output will be:
     ```python
     Output: **? pans[2] pans[2] pans[3] pans[3] (where pans[2] is the third element of the list pans and pans[3] is the fourth element of the list pans)**
     ```
   - If `mak` is 0, the output will be:
     ```python
     Output: **? pans[0] pans[0] pans[3] pans[3] (where pans[0] is the first element of the list pans and pans[3] is the fourth element of the list pans)**
     ```
   - If `mak` is 1, the output will be:
     ```python
     Output: **? pans[1] pans[1] pans[3] pans[3] (where pans[1] is the second element of the list pans and pans[3] is the fourth element of the list pans)**
     ```

Since the user input is not specified, we need to consider all possible values of `mak`. However, the most precise answer based on the given information is:

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[3] pans[3] (where pans[mak] is the element at index mak in the list pans, and pans[3] is the fourth element of the list pans, with mak being 0, 1, or 2 depending on the user input)**
