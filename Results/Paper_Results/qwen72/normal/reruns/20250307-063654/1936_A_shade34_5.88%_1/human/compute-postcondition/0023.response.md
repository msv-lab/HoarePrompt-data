Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. If no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `pans` is an empty list.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `mak` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so it will also be either 0 or the same value as `mak`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `pans` is an empty list, but it is not used in the print statement.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - It will then print the value of `mak`.
   - It will print the value of `mak2`, which is the same as `mak`.
   - It will print the value of `i`, which is 0.
   - It will print the value of `mak2` again, which is the same as `mak`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If no user input was '<', `mak` and `mak2` will both be 0.
   - If there was a user input '<', `mak` and `mak2` will both be the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 0 0 (if no user input was '<') or ? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer i (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was '<')**
