Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `pans` is an empty list.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The string `'?'` is a literal and will be printed as is.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. Since the exact user inputs are not provided, we can only describe `mak` in terms of the user inputs.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so it will have the same value as `mak`.
   - `i` is 0, as given in the initial state.
   - `mak2` is again equal to `mak`.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` separated by spaces.

Based on the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<')**
