Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The input integer remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop has completed all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`pans`**: This list will contain all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was `=`. Additionally, if the user input was `<` for any `i`, the list will contain the largest such `i`.
- **`mak`**: This variable will hold the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `mak` will remain the initial value (which is the largest `i` for which the user input was `<` before the loop started, if any).
- **`mak2`**: This variable will be equal to `mak` after the loop completes, as it is updated to match `mak` whenever `mak` changes.
- **Output Buffer**: The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration of the loop, as required by the `sys.stdout.flush()` call.
