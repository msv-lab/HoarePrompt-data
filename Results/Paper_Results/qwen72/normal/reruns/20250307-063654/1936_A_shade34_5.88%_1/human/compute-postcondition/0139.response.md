Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `pans` is a list containing at least `n + 2` elements.
   - `mak` is 0 or `n` depending on the user input.
   - `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement starts with the string `'?'`.
   - `pans[mak]` is the element in the list `pans` at the index `mak`.
   - `pans[mak]` is repeated twice.
   - `pans[i]` is the element in the list `pans` at the index `i`, which is `n + 1`.
   - `pans[i]` is also repeated twice.

4. **Values of Variables:**
   - `mak` can be either 0 or `n` depending on the user input.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `pans` is a list with at least `n + 2` elements, so `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` are valid indices.

5. **Output:**
   - If `mak` is 0, the print statement will output:
     ```
     ?, pans[0], pans[0], pans[n+1], pans[n+1]
     ```
   - If `mak` is `n`, the print statement will output:
     ```
     ?, pans[n], pans[n], pans[n+1], pans[n+1]
     ```

Since the exact values of `pans[0]`, `pans[n]`, and `pans[n+1]` are not provided, we can only describe them based on their indices in the list `pans`.

Output: **?, pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[n+1], pans[n+1] (where `mak` is 0 or `n` depending on the user input, and `pans` is a list containing at least `n + 2` elements)**
