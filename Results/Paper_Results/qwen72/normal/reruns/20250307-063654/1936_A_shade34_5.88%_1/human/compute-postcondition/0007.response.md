Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, and the user input is a string that is equal to '<'.**

The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `mak`. Therefore, `mak` is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
