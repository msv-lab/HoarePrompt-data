Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pans` is a list containing:
     - `[1]` if `s` is '<'.
     - `[0, 1]` if `s` is '='.
     - An empty list if `s` is neither '<' nor '='.
   - `mak` is:
     - 1 if `s` is '<'.
     - Otherwise, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `s` is the user input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `mak2` is explicitly given as equal to `mak`.
   - `mak` depends on the value of `s`:
     - If `s` is '<', `mak` is 1.
     - If `s` is not '<', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **If `s` is '<':**
     - `mak` is 1.
     - `mak2` is 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 1`.
   - **If `s` is not '<':**
     - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
     - `mak2` is the same as `mak`.
     - The print statement will output: `? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak]` (where `[mak]` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<').

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `s` is '<':
     Output: **? 1 1 2 1**
   - If `s` is not '<':
     Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer i for which the user input was '<')**

Since the exact value of `mak` when `s` is not '<' depends on the user input and the value of `n`, we can't determine it precisely without more information. However, based on the given conditions, the output will be as described above.
