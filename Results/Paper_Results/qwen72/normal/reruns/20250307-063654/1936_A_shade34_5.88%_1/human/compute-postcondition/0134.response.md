Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements.
   - `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on the user input.
   - `mak2` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - If the user input is '>', `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mak` can be either 0 or `n-1` based on the user input.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `pans` is a list with at least `n+1` elements, so `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` are valid indices.

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - **If the user input is '>':**
     - `mak` is set to `n-1`.
     - The print statement will output `pans[n-1]` and `pans[n]` twice.
   - **If the user input is not '>':**
     - `mak` remains 0.
     - The print statement will output `pans[0]` and `pans[n]` twice.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If the user input is '>', the output will be:
     ```python
     Output: **? pans[n-1] pans[n-1] pans[n] pans[n]**
     ```
   - If the user input is not '>', the output will be:
     ```python
     Output: **? pans[0] pans[0] pans[n] pans[n]**
     ```

Since the exact values of `pans[0]`, `pans[n-1]`, and `pans[n]` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of their indices in the list `pans`.

**Final Answer:**
- If the user input is '>', the output will be:
  Output: **? pans[n-1] pans[n-1] pans[n] pans[n]**
- If the user input is not '>', the output will be:
  Output: **? pans[0] pans[0] pans[n] pans[n]**
