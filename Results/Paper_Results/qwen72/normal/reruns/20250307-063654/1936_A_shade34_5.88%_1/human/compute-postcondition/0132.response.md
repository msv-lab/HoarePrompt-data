Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on the user input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is '>', `mak` is set to `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
