The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `pans`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `pans`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `pans` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `mak` is 0 or 1 depending on the user input, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak` (which was 0), the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is '>', `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
