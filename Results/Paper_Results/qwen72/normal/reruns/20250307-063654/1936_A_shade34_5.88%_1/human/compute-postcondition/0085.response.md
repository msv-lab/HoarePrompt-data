Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=', and must have at least `len(pans)` elements, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 2, `mak2` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
