Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `s` is '<', `[0, 1, 2]` if `s` is '=', or `[2]` if `s` is neither '<' nor '='. `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation:
- The code `pans.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `pans`.
- If `s` is '<', `pans` was initially `[1]`, so after appending `2`, it becomes `[1, 2]`.
- If `s` is '=', `pans` was initially `[0, 1]`, so after appending `2`, it becomes `[0, 1, 2]`.
- If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` was initially an empty list, so after appending `2`, it becomes `[2]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `s` remain unchanged.
