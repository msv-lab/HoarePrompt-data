Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is [0, 1] if `s` is equal to '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is [1], `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '<'.***
