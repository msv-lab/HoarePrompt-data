The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed. `s` is the input string. If `s` is '<', `mak` is 1, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. If `s` is not '<' and not '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', if no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. If `s` is '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', if no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`**.
