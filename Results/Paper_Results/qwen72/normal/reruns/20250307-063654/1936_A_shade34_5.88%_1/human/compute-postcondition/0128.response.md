Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement starts with a string `'?'`.
   - `pans[mak]` is the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`. Since `mak` is 0, this is the first element of `pans`.
   - `pans[mak]` is repeated, so the first element of `pans` is printed twice.
   - `pans[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `pans`. Since `i` is `n-1`, this is the last element of `pans`.
   - `pans[i]` is repeated, so the last element of `pans` is printed twice.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The string `'?'` is printed first.
   - The first element of `pans` is printed twice.
   - The last element of `pans` is printed twice.

Given the initial state and the structure of the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the list `pans` and [pans[n-1]] is the last element of the list `pans`)**
