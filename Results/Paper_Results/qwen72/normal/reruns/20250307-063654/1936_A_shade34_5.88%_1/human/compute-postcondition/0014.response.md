The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `mak` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the user input. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since `i` is currently 2, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the user input. If the user input is '<', `mak` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mak` retains its original value of 0 or 1.**
