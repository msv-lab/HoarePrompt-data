Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. If no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**

The code snippet `mak2 = mak` assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Since `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no such input was given, `mak2` will also hold this value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
