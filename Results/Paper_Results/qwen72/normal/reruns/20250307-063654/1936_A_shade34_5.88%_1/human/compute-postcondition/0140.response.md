Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n+1`, `pans` is a list containing at least `n+2` elements, `mak` is 0 or `n` depending on the user input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
