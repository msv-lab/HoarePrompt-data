Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is [2] if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` is [1, 2] if `s` is not equal to '<' or '=', and `pans` is [0, 1, 2] if `s` is equal to '<' or '='. `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and `mak2` is equal to `mak`. `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '<'.***
