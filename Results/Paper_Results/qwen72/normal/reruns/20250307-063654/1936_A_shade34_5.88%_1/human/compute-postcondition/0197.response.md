Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is `[2]` if `s` is '<', `[0, 1, 2]` if `s` is '=', or `[2]` if `s` is neither '<' nor '='. `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.***
