Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is equal to '=', otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. Additionally, `s` is not equal to '<'.**
