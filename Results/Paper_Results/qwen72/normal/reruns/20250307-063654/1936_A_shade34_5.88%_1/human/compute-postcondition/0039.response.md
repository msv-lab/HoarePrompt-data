Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed. `s` is the input string. If `s` is '<', `mak` is 1, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. If `s` is not '<' and not '=', `mak` is 1, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing `[1]`. If `s` is '=', `mak` is 1, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing the integer `[1]`.**
