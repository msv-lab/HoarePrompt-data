Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `mak` is 0.** 

The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer greater than 0. The code snippet initializes `mak` to 0. No other variables are affected, and the value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged value of `n` and the new value of `mak` which is 0.
