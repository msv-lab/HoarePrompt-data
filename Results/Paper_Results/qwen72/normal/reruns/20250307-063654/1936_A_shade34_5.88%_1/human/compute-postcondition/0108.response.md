Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` is [0] if `s` is equal to '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `s` is the user input string.
   - If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '<'.

2. **Determine the values of the variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the user input `s`:
     - If `s` is '<', `mak` is 0.
     - If `s` is not '<', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. However, since `s` is not '<', `mak` will be the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', but this value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `mak` in this case.

3. **Print statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`.
   - The first element printed is the string `'?'`.
   - The second element printed is `mak`.
   - The third element printed is `mak2`, which is equal to `mak`.
   - The fourth element printed is `i`, which is 1.
   - The fifth element printed is `mak2`, which is equal to `mak`.

4. **Output based on the initial state:**
   - If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 0, and `mak2` is also 0.
   - If `s` is not '<', then `mak` and `mak2` are the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', but this value is not provided, so we can't determine the exact numerical value.

Therefore, the output will be:

- If `s` is '<':
  Output: **? 0 0 1 0**

- If `s` is not '<':
  Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<')**
