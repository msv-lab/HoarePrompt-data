The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=', and must have at least `len(pans)` elements, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 2 if the user input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `mak2` remains 0.**
