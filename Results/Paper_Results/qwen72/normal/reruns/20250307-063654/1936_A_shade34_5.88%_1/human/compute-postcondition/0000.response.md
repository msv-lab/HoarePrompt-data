The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the iteration count. The loop will execute based on the integer value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this integer must be at least 1. The state before the loop starts provides information about the function's environment and constraints, but these do not directly affect the loop head. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
