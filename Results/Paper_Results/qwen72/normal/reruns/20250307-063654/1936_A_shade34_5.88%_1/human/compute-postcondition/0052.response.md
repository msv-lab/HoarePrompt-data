Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. If no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '='.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop has completed all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- **Output Buffer**: The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration, so it remains flushed.
- **`mak`**: `mak` will be the largest index `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. If no user input was '<' during any iteration, `mak` will remain 0.
- **`mak2`**: `mak2` will be equal to `mak` after the loop completes.
- **`pans`**: `pans` will be a list containing all indices `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '='. If no user input was '=', `pans` will remain an empty list.
