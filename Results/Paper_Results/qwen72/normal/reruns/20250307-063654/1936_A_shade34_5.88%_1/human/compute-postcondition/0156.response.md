Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<'.
- `mak` is 1 if the user input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mak`**: This variable is set to 1 if the user input is '<', and 0 otherwise.
2. **`i`**: This variable is explicitly set to 2.

### Possible Values:
- If the user input is '<', then `mak` will be 1.
- If the user input is anything other than '<', then `mak` will be 0.
- `i` is always 2.

### Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- The string `'?'`.
- The value of `mak` twice.
- The value of `i` twice.

### Final Output:
- If the user input is '<':
  - `mak` is 1.
  - `i` is 2.
  - The output will be: `? 1 1 2 2`.

- If the user input is anything other than '<':
  - `mak` is 0.
  - `i` is 2.
  - The output will be: `? 0 0 2 2`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 1 if the user input is '<', otherwise [mak] is 0)**
