Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this doesn't affect the print statement directly).
   - `mak` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the user input.
     - If the user input is '<', `mak` is set to 2.
     - Otherwise, `mak` retains its original value of 0 or 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first element in the print statement is a string `'?'`.
   - The second and third elements are the value of `mak`, which can be 0, 1, or 2 based on the user input.
   - The fourth and fifth elements are the value of `i`, which is 3.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is '<', `mak` is set to 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If the user input is anything other than '<', `mak` retains its original value of 0 or 1.
     - If `mak` is 0, the print statement will output: `? 0 0 3 3`.
     - If `mak` is 1, the print statement will output: `? 1 1 3 3`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will depend on the user input.
   - If the user input is '<', the output will be: `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If the user input is anything other than '<', the output will be: `? [mak] [mak] 3 3` (where `mak` is either 0 or 1).

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the user input, and if the user input is '<', [mak] is 2)**
