Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '='. This list must have at least `len(pans)` elements.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the current user input is '<', `mak` is set to 1 and `mak2` remains 0. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and `mak2` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The string `'?'` is a constant and will be printed as is.
   - `mak` is determined by the user input. If the current user input is '<', `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
   - `mak2` is not used in the print statement, so we don't need to consider its value.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If the current user input is '<', then `mak` is 1.
   - If the current user input is not '<', then `mak` is 0.

5. **Output Based on User Input:**
   - If the current user input is '<':
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`
   - If the current user input is not '<':
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 2`

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will depend on the current user input. Here are the precise descriptions:

- If the current user input is '<':
  Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
- If the current user input is not '<':
  Output: **? 0 0 2 2**

Since the exact user input is not specified, we need to consider both scenarios. However, based on the task format, we should provide the most precise description possible:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 1 if the current user input is '<', otherwise [mak] is 0)**
