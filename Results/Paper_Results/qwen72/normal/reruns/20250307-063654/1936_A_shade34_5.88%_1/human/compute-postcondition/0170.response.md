The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written immediately. However, this does not change the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `pans` is an empty list, `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
