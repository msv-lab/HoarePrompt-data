Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' and must have at least `len(pans)` elements, the output buffer has been flushed. If the current user input is '<', `mak` is set to 1 and `mak2` remains 0. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and `mak2` remains 0.***
