Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, `pans` must have at least 4 elements, `mak2` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `mak`. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the updated value of `mak`.
