Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `s` is the user input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Variable Analysis:**
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will print a string starting with `?`.
   - It will then print the value of `mak`.
   - It will print the value of `mak2`, which is the same as `mak`.
   - It will print the value of `i`, which is 1.
   - It will print the value of `mak2` again, which is the same as `mak`.

Since the exact value of `mak` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it based on the given conditions. The value of `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<')**
