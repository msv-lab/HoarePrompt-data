Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is '<', `[0, 1]` if `s` is '=', or remains an empty list if `s` is neither '<' nor '='. `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
