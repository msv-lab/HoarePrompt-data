The function `func` operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. It is designed to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the XOR of the elements at these indices in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 is maximized. The function can make at most 3n queries to the interactive environment to achieve this, where each query involves four indices (a, b, c, d) and returns one of "<", ">", or "=". If the function makes more than 3n queries, it must terminate immediately. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
