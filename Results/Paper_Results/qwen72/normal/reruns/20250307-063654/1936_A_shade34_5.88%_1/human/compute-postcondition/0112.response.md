Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is [1], `mak` is 1, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '<'.**

Explanation:
- The code `pans = [i]` assigns the list containing the value of `i` (which is 1) to `pans`.
- The value of `pans` is now [1].
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `mak`, `mak2`, `s`) and conditions (output buffer flushed, `mak` is 0 if `s` is '<', otherwise `s` is not equal to '<') remain unchanged.
