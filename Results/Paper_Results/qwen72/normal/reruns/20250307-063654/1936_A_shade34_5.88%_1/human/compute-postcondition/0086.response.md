Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=', and must have at least `len(pans)` elements, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 2 if the user input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `mak2` remains 0.***
