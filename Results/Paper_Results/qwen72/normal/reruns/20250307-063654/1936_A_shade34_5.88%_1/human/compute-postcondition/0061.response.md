Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this doesn't affect the print statement directly).
   - `mak` is 1 if the user input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0.
   - `mak2` is 0.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' and must have at least 3 elements.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `pans` is a list of integers where each integer corresponds to an index `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '='.
   - `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on the user input.
   - `i` is 2.

4. **Evaluate the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - The next four elements are `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.

5. **Possible Values:**
   - If `mak` is 0, then `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
   - If `mak` is 1, then `pans[mak]` is `pans[1]`.
   - `pans[i]` is `pans[2]` since `i` is 2.

6. **Final Output:**
   - If `mak` is 0, the output will be `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[2] pans[2]`.
   - If `mak` is 1, the output will be `? pans[1] pans[1] pans[2] pans[2]`.

Since `mak` can be either 0 or 1, we need to consider both cases. However, the exact values of `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, and `pans[2]` are not provided, but we know they are elements of the `pans` list.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where `mak` is 0 if the user input is not '>', and 1 if the user input is '>', and `pans` is a list of integers for which the user input was '=')**
