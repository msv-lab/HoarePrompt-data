Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pans` is [1] if `s` is not equal to '<' or '='. Otherwise, `pans` is [0, 1].
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `s` is the user input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '<'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `mak2` is explicitly given as equal to `mak`.
   - `mak` is determined based on the user input `s`:
     - If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is 0.
     - If `s` is not equal to '<', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. However, since `s` is not equal to '<', `mak` will be some integer value between 1 and `n-1`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `s` is equal to '<':
     - `mak` is 0.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - `i` is 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 0`.
   - If `s` is not equal to '<':
     - `mak` is some integer value between 1 and `n-1`.
     - `mak2` is the same as `mak`.
     - `i` is 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak]` (where `[mak]` is the value of `mak`).

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `s` is equal to '<':
     Output: **? 0 0 2 0**
   - If `s` is not equal to '<':
     Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer i (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was '<')**
