Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is 0.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '='. It is given that `pans` must have at least 2 elements.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
   - `i` is 1, so `pans[i]` is `pans[1]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `pans[0]`, `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, and `pans[1]`.

Since `pans` is a list of integers where each integer `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) corresponds to a user input of '=', and `pans` has at least 2 elements, the output will be:

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where [pans[0]] and [pans[1]] are the first and second elements of the list `pans` respectively)**
