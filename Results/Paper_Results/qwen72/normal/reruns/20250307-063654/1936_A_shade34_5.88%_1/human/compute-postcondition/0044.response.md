Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - If `s` is '<':
     - `mak` is 1.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - `pans` is a list containing `[1]`.
   - If `s` is not '<' and not '=':
     - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
     - If no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0.
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - `pans` is a list containing `[1]`.
   - If `s` is '=':
     - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
     - If no user input was '<', `mak` remains 0.
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `mak2` is always equal to `mak` based on the initial state.
   - The value of `mak` depends on the input string `s`:
     - If `s` is '<', `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 0.
     - If `s` is not '<' and not '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no user input was '<'.
     - If `s` is '=', `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no user input was '<'.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `s` is '<':
     - `mak` is 1.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - `i` is 2.
     - `mak2` is 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 0 2 0`.
   - If `s` is not '<' and not '=':
     - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no user input was '<'.
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - `i` is 2.
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - The print statement will output: `? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak]` (where `[mak]` is the value of `mak`).
   - If `s` is '=':
     - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no user input was '<'.
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - `i` is 2.
     - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
     - The print statement will output: `? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak]` (where `[mak]` is the value of `mak`).

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `s` is '<':
     Output: **? 1 0 2 0**
   - If `s` is not '<' and not '=':
     Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer i (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no user input was '<')**
   - If `s` is '=':
     Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer i (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no user input was '<')**
