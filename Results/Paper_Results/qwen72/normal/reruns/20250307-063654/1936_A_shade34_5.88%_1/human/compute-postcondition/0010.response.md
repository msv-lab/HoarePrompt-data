Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - The output buffer has been flushed, which means any previous output has been displayed.
   - If the user input is a string that is equal to '<', `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output a string that starts with a question mark (`?`).
   - The next two values in the output are `mak`, which is determined by the user input.
   - The last two values in the output are `i`, which is explicitly set to 2.

4. **Determining `mak`:**
   - If the user input is '<', then `mak` is set to 1.
   - If the user input is anything other than '<', then `mak` remains 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If the user input is '<', the output will be: `? 1 1 2 2`.
   - If the user input is anything other than '<', the output will be: `? 0 0 2 2`.

Since the user input is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both cases:

Output: **? 1 1 2 2 (if the user input is '<') or ? 0 0 2 2 (if the user input is anything other than '<')**
