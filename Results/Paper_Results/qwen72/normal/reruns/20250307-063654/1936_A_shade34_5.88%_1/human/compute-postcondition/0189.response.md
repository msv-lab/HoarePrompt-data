The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1 to 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is '<', `[0, 1]` if `s` is '=', or remains an empty list if `s` is neither '<' nor '='. `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
