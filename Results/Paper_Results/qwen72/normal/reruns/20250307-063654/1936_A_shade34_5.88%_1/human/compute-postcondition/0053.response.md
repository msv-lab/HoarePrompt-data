Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '='.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is reset to 0.
- Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak2` is also reset to 0.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and the output buffer state remain unchanged.
- The list `pans` remains unchanged, still containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '='.
