Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation:
- `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2.
- `mak2` remains 0, as it was previously set to the value of `mak` (which was 0).
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `pans`, and the output buffer) remain unchanged.
