Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` remains unchanged (not relevant to the print statement).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pans` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `mak` is 0 or 1 depending on the user input.
   - `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak` (which was 0).
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If the user input is '>', `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mak` can be either 0 or 1 based on the user input.
   - `mak2` is 0 (not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pans` has at least 3 elements, so `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, and `pans[2]` are valid indices.

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - **If the user input is '>'**:
     - `mak` is set to 1.
     - The print statement will output:
       - `pans[1]` (since `mak` is 1)
       - `pans[1]` (since `mak` is 1)
       - `pans[2]` (since `i` is 2)
       - `pans[2]` (since `i` is 2)
   - **If the user input is not '>'**:
     - `mak` remains 0.
     - The print statement will output:
       - `pans[0]` (since `mak` is 0)
       - `pans[0]` (since `mak` is 0)
       - `pans[2]` (since `i` is 2)
       - `pans[2]` (since `i` is 2)

5. **Final Output:**
   - If the user input is '>':
     Output: **? [pans[1]] [pans[1]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where pans[1] is the second element of the pans list and pans[2] is the third element of the pans list)**
   - If the user input is not '>':
     Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[2] is the third element of the pans list)**

Since the user input is not specified, we need to consider both cases:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where mak is 0 or 1 depending on the user input, and pans[2] is the third element of the pans list)**
