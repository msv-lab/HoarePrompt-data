Functionality: ** The function operates in an interactive environment to find a pair of indices (i, j) in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 such that the XOR of the elements at these indices is maximized. It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). The function makes at most 3n queries to the environment, each involving four indices (a, b, c, d) where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and the environment responds with either "<", ">", or "=". After processing, the function outputs a pair of indices (mak2, mak) where `mak2` is the index of the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ i < n) for which the user input was '<' and `mak` is the index of the largest element in a subset of indices for which the user input was '>'. The function ensures that the output buffer is flushed after each query and after the final output. If the function exceeds 3n queries, it must terminate immediately. **
