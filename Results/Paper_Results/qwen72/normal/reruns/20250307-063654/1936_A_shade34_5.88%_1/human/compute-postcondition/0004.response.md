Based on the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is 0.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- The first element is a string `'?'`.
- The second and third elements are the value of `mak`, which is 0.
- The fourth and fifth elements are the value of `i`, which is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
