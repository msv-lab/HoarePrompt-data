Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements, `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on the user input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command flushes the output buffer, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial state information remains valid.
