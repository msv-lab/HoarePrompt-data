The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<', `mak` is 1 if the user input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**
