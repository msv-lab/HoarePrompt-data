Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '='.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `mak` is 2 if the user input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0.
   - `mak2` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first element in the print statement is a string `'?'`.
   - The second and third elements are `mak`. Based on the initial state, `mak` is 2 if the user input is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0.
   - The fourth and fifth elements are `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is 3.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If the user input is '<', then `mak` will be 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If the user input is not '<', then `mak` will remain 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 3 3`.

Since the user input is not explicitly provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the task requires us to determine what will be printed based on the given initial state.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is 2 if the user input is '<', otherwise [mak] is 0)**
