Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `s` is the input string, `mak` is 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[1, 2]`.**

The value of `i` (which is 2) is appended to the list `pans`, which initially contained `[1]`. Therefore, `pans` now contains `[1, 2]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
