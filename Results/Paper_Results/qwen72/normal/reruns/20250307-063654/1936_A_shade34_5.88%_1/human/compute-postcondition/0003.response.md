The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1. This is because the `range(1, n)` function generates a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute. Given that `n` is already stated to be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to run at least once. The variable `i` will start at 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0**
