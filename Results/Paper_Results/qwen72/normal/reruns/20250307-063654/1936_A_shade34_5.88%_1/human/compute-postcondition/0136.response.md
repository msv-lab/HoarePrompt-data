Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements, `mak` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to `i`.
- Since `i` is equal to `n` in the initial state, `mak` is now equal to `n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
