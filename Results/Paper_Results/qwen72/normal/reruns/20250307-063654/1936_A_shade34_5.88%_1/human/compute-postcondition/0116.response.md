The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is [1] if `s` is not equal to '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` is [0, 1]. `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and `mak2` is equal to `mak`. `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is 0. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '<'.**
