Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '='. This list must have at least `len(pans)` elements.
- The output buffer has been flushed.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`mak`**: According to the initial state, `mak` is 0.
2. **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 1.
3. **`pans`**: The list `pans` contains integers where the user input was '='. However, the exact values in `pans` are not provided, and they are not used in the print statement.
4. **`mak2`**: This variable is mentioned in the initial state but is not used in the print statement.

### What is Printed:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `?`.
- It will then print the value of `mak` twice, which is 0.
- It will then print the value of `i` twice, which is 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
