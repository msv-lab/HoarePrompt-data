Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` contains the indices for which the user input was '=' or the last index for which the user input was '<', `mak` is the largest index `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and the output buffer has been flushed.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is only used as the upper limit for the loop's range.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`pans`**: The list `pans` will contain the indices for which the user input was '='. If the user input was '<' at any point, `pans` will contain the last index for which this was true.
- **`mak`**: `mak` will be the largest index `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. If no such index exists, `mak` will remain the initial value (which is the largest index for which the user input was '<' before the loop started).
- **`mak2`**: `mak2` will be equal to `mak` after the loop finishes, as it is updated to match `mak` whenever `mak` changes.
- **Output Buffer**: The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration, so it remains flushed at the end of the loop.
