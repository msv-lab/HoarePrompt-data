Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<'.
   - `mak` is 2 if the user input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The first argument to the `print` function is a string `'?'`.
   - The second and third arguments are both `mak`.
   - The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i`.

4. **Evaluate `mak` and `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `mak` depends on the user input:
     - If the user input was '<', then `mak` is 2.
     - If the user input was not '<', then `mak` remains 0.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The output will always start with the string `'?'`.
   - The next two values will be `mak`.
   - The last two values will be `i`, which is 3.

6. **Final Output:**
   - If the user input was '<', the output will be: `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If the user input was not '<', the output will be: `? 0 0 3 3`.

Since the user input is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both cases:

Output: **? 2 2 3 3 (if the user input was '<') or ? 0 0 3 3 (if the user input was not '<')**
