Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. Each query involves four indices (a, b, c, d) where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n. The output of each query is either "<", ">", or "=". The function must terminate immediately if it makes more than 3n queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
