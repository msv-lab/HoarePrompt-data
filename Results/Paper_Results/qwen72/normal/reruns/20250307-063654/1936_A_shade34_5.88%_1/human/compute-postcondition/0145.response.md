Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<', `mak` is the index of the largest element in `pans` for which the user input was '>', `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the output buffer status.
