Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `pans` is an empty list.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<'. This means `mak` is a value between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive) where the user input was '<'.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so it will have the same value as `mak`.
   - `i` is 0, as given in the initial state.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` in that order.
   - Since `mak` and `mak2` are the same, they will appear twice in the output.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The string `'?'` will be printed first.
   - Then, the value of `mak` (which is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<') will be printed.
   - Next, the value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`) will be printed.
   - The value of `i` (which is 0) will be printed.
   - Finally, the value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`) will be printed again.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer `i` (1 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<')**
