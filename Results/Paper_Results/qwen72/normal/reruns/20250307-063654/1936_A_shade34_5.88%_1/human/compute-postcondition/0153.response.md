Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<', `mak` is 1, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', the output buffer has been flushed, and the user input is '<'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
