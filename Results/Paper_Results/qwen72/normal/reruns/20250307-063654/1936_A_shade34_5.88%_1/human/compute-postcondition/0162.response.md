Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' or the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<', `mak` is 2 if the user input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the state of the output buffer.
