Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 3.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this doesn't affect the print statement directly).
   - `mak` is 2 if the user input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 1.
   - `mak2` is 0 (this is not used in the print statement).
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' and must have at least 4 elements.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The print statement starts with a string `'?'`.
   - The next two elements are `pans[mak]`.
   - The last two elements are `pans[i]`.

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - `pans` is a list of integers where each integer `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) corresponds to a user input of '='.
   - `mak` can be either 1 or 2 based on the user input.
   - `i` is 3.

5. **Possible Values:**
   - Since `pans` must have at least 4 elements, `pans[1]` and `pans[2]` are valid indices.
   - `pans[3]` is also a valid index because `pans` has at least 4 elements.

6. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `mak` is 1, the print statement will be:
     ```
     print('?', pans[1], pans[1], pans[3], pans[3])
     ```
   - If `mak` is 2, the print statement will be:
     ```
     print('?', pans[2], pans[2], pans[3], pans[3])
     ```

Since the exact values of `pans` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the indices and the list `pans`.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]] (where `mak` is 1 if the user input was not '>', and 2 if the user input was '>', and `pans` is a list of integers for which the user input was '=')**
