Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' and must have at least `len(pans)` elements, the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, which ensures that the output buffer is flushed. This action does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program, so all the initial conditions remain valid.
