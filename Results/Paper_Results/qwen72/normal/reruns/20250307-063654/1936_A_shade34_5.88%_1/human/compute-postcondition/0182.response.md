Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. `mak` is the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.** 

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command has been executed, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. The values of `n`, `i`, `pans`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `s` remain unchanged.
