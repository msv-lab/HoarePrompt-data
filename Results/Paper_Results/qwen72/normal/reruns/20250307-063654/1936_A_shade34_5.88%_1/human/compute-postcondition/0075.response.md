Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' and must have at least `len(pans)` elements.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mak` is set to 0, overriding any previous value it might have had.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged.
- The output buffer has already been flushed, so this state remains valid.
- The list `pans` still contains all integers `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '=' and must have at least `len(pans)` elements.
