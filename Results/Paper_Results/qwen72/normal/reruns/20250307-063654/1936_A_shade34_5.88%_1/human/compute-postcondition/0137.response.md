Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing at least `n+1` elements, `mak` is 0 or `n` depending on the user input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` (1 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) for which the user input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is '>', `mak` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 or `n-1` as initially set.***
