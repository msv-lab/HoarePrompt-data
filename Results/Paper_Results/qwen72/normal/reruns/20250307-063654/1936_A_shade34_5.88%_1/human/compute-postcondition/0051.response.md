Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `s` is the input string, `mak` is 2 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is 1 if `s` is not '<', `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[2]` if `s` is '<'. If `s` is '=', `pans` is updated to `[1, 2]`, otherwise `pans` remains `[1]`.***
