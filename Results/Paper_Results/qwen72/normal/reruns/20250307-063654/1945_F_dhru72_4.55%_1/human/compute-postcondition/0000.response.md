The provided code snippet introduces a type variable `T` using `TypeVar` from the `typing` module. This does not affect the existing variables or their values in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the type variable `T`.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, v is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `T` is a type variable.**
