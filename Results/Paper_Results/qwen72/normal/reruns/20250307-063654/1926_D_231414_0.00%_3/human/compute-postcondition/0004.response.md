The code `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `data`.

Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of input integers.**
