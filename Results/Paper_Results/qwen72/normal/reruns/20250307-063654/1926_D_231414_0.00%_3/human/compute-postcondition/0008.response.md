The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `data`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `data`. If `data` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `i` will be the first element of `data` at the start of the loop.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`**
