Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`, `s` is the result of `i` XOR `2147483647`.** 

In natural language: The variable `s` is now the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the first element of the list `data` and the integer `2147483647`. All other variables remain unchanged.
