Precondition: **The function should take a list of integers as input, where each integer is in the range 0 to 2^31 - 1, and the length of the list is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer in the range 1 to 10^4.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases and the list of integers for each test case. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
