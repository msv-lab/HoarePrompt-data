The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `times`. For the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

So, for the loop to execute, the state must ensure that `times` is at least 1. The other details about the list of integers and the `check` variable are not relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0**
