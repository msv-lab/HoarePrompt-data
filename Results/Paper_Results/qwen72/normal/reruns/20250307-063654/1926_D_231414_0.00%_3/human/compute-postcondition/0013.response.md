Postcondition: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `dic` is a dictionary with `s` as a key and its value is now `dic[s] - 1`, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`, `s` is the result of `i` XOR `2147483647`, and the current value of `dic[s]` is 0.**
