The code snippet `stack.append((node, x))` updates the `stack` by appending the tuple `(node, x)` to it. Given the initial state, the `stack` originally contains the tuple `(1, 1)`. After appending `(node, x)`, the `stack` will contain two tuples: `(1, 1)` and `(node, x)`. The values of `node` and `x` are specified as `node` being the third element in `g[x]` and `x` being 1. Therefore, the tuple being appended is `(node, 1)`.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `stack` is a list containing the tuples (1, 1) and (node, 1), `visited` is a set containing the element 1, `d` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair (1: 1), `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `x` is in the visited set, and `g[x]` must have at least three elements, `node` is the third element in `g[x]`.**
