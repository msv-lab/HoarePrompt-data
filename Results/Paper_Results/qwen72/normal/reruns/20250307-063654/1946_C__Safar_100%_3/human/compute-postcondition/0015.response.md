Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `stack` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1). If `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` is updated to include the tuple (node, x). `visited` is a set containing the element 1, `d` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair (1: 1), `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `x` is in the visited set, and `g[x]` must have at least two elements, `node` is the second element in `g[x]`.**
