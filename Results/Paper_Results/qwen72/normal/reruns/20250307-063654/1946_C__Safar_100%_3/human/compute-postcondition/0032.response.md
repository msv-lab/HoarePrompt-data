Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\) representing the number of edges to be removed.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple \((a, b)\) represents an edge between vertices \(a\) and \(b\), with \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\).
- `g` is a list of \(n + 1\) lists where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge.
- `c` is 0.
- `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l - 1)` is false and `check(l)` is true.
- `r` is `l - 1` if `check(l - 1)` is true, otherwise `r` is the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(r)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `l` and `r`:**
   - `l` is determined by the `check` function. It is the smallest integer such that `check(l - 1)` is false and `check(l)` is true.
   - `r` is determined based on the value of `l`:
     - If `check(l - 1)` is true, then `r` is set to `l - 1`.
     - Otherwise, `r` is the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false.

2. **Determining `r`:**
   - The value of `r` depends on the `check` function, which is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, the description of `r` gives us a clear condition:
     - If `check(l - 1)` is true, then `r` is `l - 1`.
     - If `check(l - 1)` is false, then `r` is the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false.

3. **Output:**
   - Since the exact `check` function is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `r`. However, based on the given conditions, we can describe `r` in terms of the `check` function.

### Final Output:
Output: **r (where r is `l - 1` if `check(l - 1)` is true, otherwise r is the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false)**
