Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, stack is a list containing a single tuple (1, 1).** 

The stack is initialized with a single tuple (1, 1), while the values of A, g, and k remain unchanged.
