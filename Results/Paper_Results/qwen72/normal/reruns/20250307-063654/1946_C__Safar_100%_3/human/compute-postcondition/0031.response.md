Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 <= a, b <= n, `g` is a list of n + 1 lists where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge, `c` is 0, `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l - 1)` is false and `check(l)` is true, and `r` is `l - 1` if `check(l - 1)` is true, otherwise `r` is the largest integer such that `check(r)` is false.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the variables `n`, `k`, `edges`, `g`, and `c` remain unchanged. The variable `l` will be the smallest integer for which the `check` function returns true, and `r` will be the largest integer for which the `check` function returns false. If `l` is the smallest integer for which `check` returns true, `r` will be `l - 1`. If `l` is the first integer for which `check` returns true, `r` will be the largest integer for which `check` returns false. The loop essentially narrows down the range between `l` and `r` until they converge to the point where `l` is the smallest integer satisfying the condition, and `r` is the largest integer not satisfying the condition.
