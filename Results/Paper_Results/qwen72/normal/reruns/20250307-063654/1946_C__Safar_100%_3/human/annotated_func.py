#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer such that 1 <= k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 <= a, b <= n.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 <= a, b <= n, and `g` is a list of n + 1 lists where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge.

    print(r)
    #This is printed: - Since the exact `check` function is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `r`. However, based on the given conditions, we can describe `r` in terms of the `check` function.

    #### Final Output:
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` such that 1 <= k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 <= a, b <= n. It constructs an adjacency list `g` representing the tree. The function then performs a binary search to find the largest integer `r` such that the `check` function (which is not provided) returns `False` for `r` and `True` for `r + 1`. Finally, it prints the value of `r`. The exact value of `r` depends on the implementation of the `check` function.
