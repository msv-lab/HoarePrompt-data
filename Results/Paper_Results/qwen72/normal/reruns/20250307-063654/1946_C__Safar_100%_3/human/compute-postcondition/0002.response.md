Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, stack is a list containing a single tuple (1, 1), visited is an empty set, d is a dictionary with a single key-value pair (1: 1).**

The dictionary `d` now contains a single key-value pair where the key is 1 and the value is 1. The other variables (`A`, `g`, `k`, `stack`, and `visited`) remain unchanged.
