Postcondition: ***A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree, stack is a list containing a single tuple (1, 1), visited is a set containing 1, x is 1, p is 1. If `d[x]` is greater than or equal to A, then `r` is 1 and `d` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair (1: 1). Otherwise, `r` is 0 and `d` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair (1: 2).***
