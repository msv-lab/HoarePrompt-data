The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n, representing the number of edges to be removed, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 <= a, b <= n. The function returns the number of connected components in the tree after removing `k` edges.
