Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` such that 1 <= k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 <= a, b <= n. It constructs an adjacency list `g` representing the tree. The function then performs a binary search to find the largest integer `r` such that the `check` function (which is not provided) returns `False` for `r` and `True` for `r + 1`. Finally, it prints the value of `r`. The exact value of `r` depends on the implementation of the `check` function. **
