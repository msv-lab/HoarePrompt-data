Precondition: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and a list of edges that form a tree with exactly two leaves. Additionally, there is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round.**
