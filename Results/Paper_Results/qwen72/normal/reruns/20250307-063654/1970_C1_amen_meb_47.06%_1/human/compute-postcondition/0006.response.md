Output State: **`numbers` is a list of strings representing the input values, `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000, `u_1` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and the list of edges forms a tree with exactly two leaves. If the length of `numbers` is not equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `num1` is the integer value of the first string in `numbers`.**
