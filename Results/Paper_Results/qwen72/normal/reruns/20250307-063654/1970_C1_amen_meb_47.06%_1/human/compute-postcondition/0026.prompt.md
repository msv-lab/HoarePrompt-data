You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and a list of edges that form a tree with exactly two leaves. Additionally, there is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers `[num1, num2]` representing the edges of the tree. The loop will continue to append these inner lists to `numbers` until an input is provided that does not contain exactly two integers. `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000; `u_1` is an integer between 1 and `n`; the list of edges forms a tree with exactly two leaves.
    return numbers
    #The program returns the list `numbers` which contains a series of inner lists, each with two integers `[num1, num2]`, representing the edges of a tree. The tree is constructed such that it has exactly two leaves, and the integers in the inner lists are between 1 and `n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list `numbers` containing inner lists, each with two integers `[num1, num2]`, representing the edges of a tree. The tree is constructed such that it has exactly two leaves, and the integers in the inner lists are between 1 and `n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `numbers` which contains a series of inner lists, each with two integers `[num1, num2]`, representing the edges of a tree. The tree is constructed such that it has exactly two leaves, and the integers in the inner lists are between 1 and `n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
