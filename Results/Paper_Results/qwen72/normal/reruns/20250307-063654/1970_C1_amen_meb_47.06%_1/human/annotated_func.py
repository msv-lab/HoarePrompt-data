#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and a list of edges that form a tree with exactly two leaves. Additionally, there is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers `[num1, num2]` representing the edges of the tree. The loop will continue to append these inner lists to `numbers` until an input is provided that does not contain exactly two integers. `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000; `u_1` is an integer between 1 and `n`; the list of edges forms a tree with exactly two leaves.
    return numbers
    #The program returns the list `numbers` which contains a series of inner lists, each with two integers `[num1, num2]`, representing the edges of a tree. The tree is constructed such that it has exactly two leaves, and the integers in the inner lists are between 1 and `n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user until an input line is provided that does not contain exactly two integers. Each valid input line is split into two integers, which are then appended to a list `numbers` as a pair `[num1, num2]`. The function returns the list `numbers`, which contains these pairs of integers. The list `numbers` represents the edges of a tree, where each integer in the pairs is between 1 and `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and the tree is constructed such that it has exactly two leaves.
