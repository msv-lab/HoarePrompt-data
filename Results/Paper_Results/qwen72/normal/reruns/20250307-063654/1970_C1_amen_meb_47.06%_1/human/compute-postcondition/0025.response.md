Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list `numbers` containing inner lists, each with two integers `[num1, num2]`, representing the edges of a tree. The tree is constructed such that it has exactly two leaves, and the integers in the inner lists are between 1 and `n`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000.**
