Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the state of the variables before the loop. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the program state for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and a list of edges that form a tree with exactly two leaves. Additionally, there is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round. `numbers` is an empty list.**
