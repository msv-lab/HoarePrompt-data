Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user until an input line is provided that does not contain exactly two integers. Each valid input line is split into two integers, which are then appended to a list `numbers` as a pair `[num1, num2]`. The function returns the list `numbers`, which contains these pairs of integers. The list `numbers` represents the edges of a tree, where each integer in the pairs is between 1 and `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and the tree is constructed such that it has exactly two leaves. **
