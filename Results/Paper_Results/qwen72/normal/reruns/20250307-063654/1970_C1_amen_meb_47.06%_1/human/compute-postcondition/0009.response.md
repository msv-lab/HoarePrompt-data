For a `while True` loop, the loop condition is always true, meaning the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Since the loop condition does not depend on any specific state variables, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`numbers` is a list of strings representing the input values, with an additional element `[num1, num2]` appended to it; `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000; `u_1` is an integer between 1 and `n`; the list of edges forms a tree with exactly two leaves; `num1` is the integer value of the first string in `numbers`; `num2` is the integer value of the second string in `numbers`.**
