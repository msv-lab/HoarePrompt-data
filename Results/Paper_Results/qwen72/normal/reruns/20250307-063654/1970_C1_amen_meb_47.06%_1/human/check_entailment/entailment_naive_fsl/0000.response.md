Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads input until it encounters a line with a different format, but it does not handle the specific input format required by the problem. The problem specifies that the first line contains two integers `n` and `t`, followed by `n-1` lines of edges, and then a line with the starting node for the round. The provided program does not account for this structure.

2. **Tree Representation**: The program does not build a tree or an array-like representation of the tree. It simply reads pairs of numbers and stores them in a list, which does not help in determining the game's outcome.

3. **Game Logic**: The program does not implement the game logic where players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor. It only compares the numbers in the sublists, which is not relevant to the game described.

4. **Output**: The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the tree structure and the starting node. It simply counts the number of times the first number in a sublist is greater than the second number, which is not the correct way to determine the winner.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
For the input:
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
The program should output "Ron" because the tree is a simple path from node 1 to node 3, and starting from node 3, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins. However, the provided program will not produce the correct output because it does not implement the game logic at all.

For the input:
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
The program should output "Hermione" because the tree is a simple path from node 1 to node 5, and starting from node 5, Hermione can always force Ron into a losing position. However, the provided program will not produce the correct output for the same reason as above.
