Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and a list of edges that form a tree with exactly two leaves. Additionally, there is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) indicating the starting node for the round. `numbers` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    nums = input().split()
    if len(nums) != 2:
        break
    num1 = int(nums[0])
    num2 = int(nums[1])
    numbers.append([num1, num2])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `numbers` is a list of strings representing the input values, with an additional element `[num1, num2]` appended to it; `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000; `u_1` is an integer between 1 and `n`; the list of edges forms a tree with exactly two leaves; `num1` is the integer value of the first string in `numbers`; `num2` is the integer value of the second string in `numbers`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `numbers` is a list of strings representing the input values, with an additional element `[num1, num2]` appended to it twice; `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000; `u_1` is an integer between 1 and `n`; the list of edges forms a tree with exactly two leaves; `num1` is the integer value of the first string in `nums`; `num2` is the integer value of the second string in `nums`; `nums` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the input. If `len(nums) != 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `num2` is the integer value of the second string in `nums`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `numbers` is a list of strings representing the input values, with the list `[num1, num2]` appended to it three times; `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000; `u_1` is an integer between 1 and `n`; the list of edges forms a tree with exactly two leaves; `num1` is the integer value of the first string in `nums`; `num2` is the integer value of the second string in `nums`; if `len(nums) != 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
