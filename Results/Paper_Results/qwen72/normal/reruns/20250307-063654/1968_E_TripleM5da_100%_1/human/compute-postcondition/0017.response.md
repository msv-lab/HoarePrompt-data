The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is the new input integer greater than or equal to 4**
