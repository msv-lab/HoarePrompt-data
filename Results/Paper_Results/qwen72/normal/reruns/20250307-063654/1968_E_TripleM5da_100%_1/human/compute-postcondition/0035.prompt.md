You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer n as input where 2 <= n <= 10^3, and the input is provided through multiple test cases, each on a new line, with the first line indicating the number of test cases t where 1 <= t <= 50.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: `i` is equal to the input integer `n` for the last test case, and `n` remains unchanged for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` for each of up to 50 test cases, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, and returns a result for each test case. If `n` is within the valid range, the function returns a specific output based on the value of `n`. If `n` is outside the valid range, the function's behavior is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
