Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the new input integer greater than or equal to 3.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have incremented from 3 up to `n + 1`. The loop starts at `i = 3` and runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Each iteration increments `i` by 1, so when the loop finishes, `i` will be one more than `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop, and it must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute at least once.
