The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that prints the values `1` and `1`. The initial state describes the values of `i` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(1, 1)
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement is printing two constants, both of which are `1`.
   - The values of `i` and `n` are not relevant to the `print` statement because they are not referenced in it.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the values `1` and `1` separated by a space.

Output: **1 1**
