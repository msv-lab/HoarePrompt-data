The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts from `i = 3` and iterates up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 5, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5**
