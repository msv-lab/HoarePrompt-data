The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from 3 to `n + 1` (exclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. However, since `i` is not part of the range at the start of the loop, it must have been set to 0 outside the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next value in the range, which is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the range to include at least one value (3).

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
