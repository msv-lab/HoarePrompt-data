The code snippet provided is:
```
print(i, i)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 3, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement will print the value of `i` twice. Since `i` is explicitly given as 3, the output will be:
Output: **3, 3**
