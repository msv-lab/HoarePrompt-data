Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of choosing n cells in an n x n grid to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the value of n and prints a specific arrangement of cells.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading n for Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
3. **Printing the First Two Cells**:
   - The program always prints the cells `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - This ensures that the minimum Manhattan distance (1) is included in the set.
4. **Printing the Remaining Cells**:
   - For the remaining cells, the program prints `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n`.
   - This ensures that the cells are placed along the diagonal starting from `(3, 3)` to `(n, n)`.

### Analysis of the Program's Output:
- **For n = 2**:
  - The program prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
  - The set of Manhattan distances is `{1}` (since the only distance is `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`).
  - This is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 2\) is 2, and the program includes 0 and 1.

- **For n = 3**:
  - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(3, 3)`.
  - The set of Manhattan distances is `{0, 1, 2, 3}`:
    - `|1-1| + |1-1| = 0`
    - `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
    - `|1-1| + |2-3| = 2`
    - `|1-3| + |1-3| = 3`
  - This is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) is 4, and the program includes all these distances.

- **For n = 4**:
  - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 3)`, and `(4, 4)`.
  - The set of Manhattan distances is `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`:
    - `|1-1| + |1-1| = 0`
    - `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
    - `|1-1| + |2-3| = 2`
    - `|1-1| + |2-4| = 3`
    - `|1-3| + |1-3| = 2`
    - `|1-3| + |1-4| = 3`
    - `|1-4| + |1-4| = 3`
    - `|3-3| + |3-4| = 1`
    - `|3-4| + |3-4| = 2`
  - This is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) is 6, and the program includes all these distances.

- **For n = 5**:
  - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 3)`, `(4, 4)`, and `(5, 5)`.
  - The set of Manhattan distances is `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}`:
    - `|1-1| + |1-1| = 0`
    - `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
    - `|1-1| + |2-3| = 2`
    - `|1-1| + |2-4| = 3`
    - `|1-1| + |2-5| = 4`
    - `|1-3| + |1-3| = 2`
    - `|1-3| + |1-4| = 3`
    - `|1-3| + |1-5| = 4`
    - `|1-4| + |1-4| = 3`
    - `|1-4| + |1-5| = 4`
    - `|1-5| + |1-5| = 4`
    - `|3-3| + |3-4| = 1`
    - `|3-3| + |3-5| = 2`
    - `|3-4| + |3-4| = 2`
    - `|3-4| + |3-5| = 3`
    - `|3-5| + |3-5| = 2`
    - `|4-4| + |4-5| = 1`
    - `|4-5| + |4-5| = 2`
  - This is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 5\) is 9, and the program includes all these distances.

- **For n = 6**:
  - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(3, 3)`, `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, and `(6, 6)`.
  - The set of Manhattan distances is `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}`:
    - `|1-1| + |1-1| = 0`
    - `|1-1| + |1-2| = 1`
    - `|1-1| + |2-3| = 2`
    - `|1-1| + |2-4| = 3`
    - `|1-1| + |2-5| = 4`

    - `|1-3| + |1-6| = 5`
    - `|1-4| + |1-4| = 3`
    - `|1-4| + |1-5| = 4`
    - `|1-4| + |1-6| = 5`
    - `|1-5| + |1-5| = 4`
    - `|1-5| + |1-6| = 5`
    - `|1-6| + |1-6| = 5`
    - `|3-3| + |3-4| = 1`
    - `|3-3| + |3-5| = 2`
    - `|3-3| + |3-6| = 3`
    - `|3-4| + |3-4| = 2`
    - `|3-4| + |3-5| = 3`
    - `|3-4| + |3-6| = 4`
    - `|3-5| + |3-5| = 3`
    - `|3-5| + |3-6| = 4`
    - `|3-6| + |3-6| = 4`
    - `|4-4| + |4-5| = 1`
    - `|4-4| + |4-6| = 2`
    - `|4-5| + |4-5| = 2`
    - `|4-5| + |4-6| = 3`
    - `|4-6| + |4-6| = 2`
    - `|5-5| + |5-6| = 1`
    - `|5-6| + |5-6| = 2`
  - This is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 6\) is 11, and the program includes all these distances.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly prints a set of cells that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given values of \(n\). The logic ensures that the set of Manhattan distances is maximized by placing the first two cells at `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, and the remaining cells along the diagonal from `(3, 3)` to `(n, n)`. This approach guarantees that all possible distances are included, and the program handles the constraints and input format
