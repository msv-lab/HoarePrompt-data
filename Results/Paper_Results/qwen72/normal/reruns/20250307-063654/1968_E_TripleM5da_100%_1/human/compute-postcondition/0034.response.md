Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` for each of up to 50 test cases, where 2 <= n <= 10^3, and returns a result for each test case. If `n` is within the valid range, the function returns a specific output based on the value of `n`. If `n` is outside the valid range, the function's behavior is not specified.**
