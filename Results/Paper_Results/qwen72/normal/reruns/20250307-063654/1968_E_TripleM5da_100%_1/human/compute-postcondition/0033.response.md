Output State: **`i` is equal to the input integer `n` for the last test case, and `n` remains unchanged for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations for each test case, the variable `i` will be equal to the input integer `n` for the last test case. The value of `n` for each test case remains the same as it was when the loop started for that test case. The loop will have printed the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and then `(i, i)` for each `i` from 3 to `n` for each test case.
