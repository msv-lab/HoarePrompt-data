The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop starts from `i = 3` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is no longer less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 4, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
