Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the value of `n` will remain unchanged from its initial value. The loop starts at `i = 3` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n + 1`, at which point the loop stops. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `i` will be `n`.
