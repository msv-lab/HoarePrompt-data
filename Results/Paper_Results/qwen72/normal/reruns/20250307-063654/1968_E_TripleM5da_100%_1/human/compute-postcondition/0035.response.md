Functionality: ** The function `func` processes up to 50 test cases, each with an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 10^3. For each test case, it prints a series of pairs of integers. Specifically, it prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and then for each integer `i` from 3 to `n` (inclusive), it prints (i, i). The function does not return any value; it only prints the output. After the function concludes, the input integer `n` for each test case remains unchanged, and the loop variable `i` is equal to `n + 1` for the last test case. **
