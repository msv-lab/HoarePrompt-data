The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 4, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 to satisfy the condition `i < n + 1`.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
