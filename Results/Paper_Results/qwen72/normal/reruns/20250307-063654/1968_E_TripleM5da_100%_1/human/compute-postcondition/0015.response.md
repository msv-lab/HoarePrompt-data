The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts with `i` in the range from 3 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3 (since the loop starts at 3). Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which is not correct for the loop to execute. Therefore, `i` should be 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the new input integer greater than or equal to 3**
