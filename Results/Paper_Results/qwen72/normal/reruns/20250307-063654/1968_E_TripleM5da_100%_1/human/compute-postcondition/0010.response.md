Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` remains the same as the input integer greater than 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `n`. The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, which is an input integer greater than 0. The loop starts at `i = 3` and increments `i` by 1 for each iteration until `i` is no longer less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n`.
