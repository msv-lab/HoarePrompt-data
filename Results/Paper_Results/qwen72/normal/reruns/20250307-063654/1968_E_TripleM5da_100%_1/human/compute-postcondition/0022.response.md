The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the new input integer `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is the new input integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be reset to 0, and the new input integer `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the new input integer greater than 0**
