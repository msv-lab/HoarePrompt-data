The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, because the range starts at 3 and goes up to `n + 1`. The variable `i` is being redefined by the loop, so its initial value (0) is not relevant to the loop's execution. However, for the loop to start, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
