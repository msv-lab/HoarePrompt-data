The only object in the loop head is the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. This expression reads a line from the standard input, converts it to an integer, and checks if it is greater than 0 to determine if the loop should execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0, and `solve()` has been called and returned. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value read by `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must also be greater than 0.

Since the loop head reads a new value from the standard input each time, the state of `int(sys.stdin.readline())` is what needs to be adjusted. However, the actual value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())` is not stored in a variable, so it is read anew each time the loop condition is evaluated.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0, `solve()` has been called and returned.**
