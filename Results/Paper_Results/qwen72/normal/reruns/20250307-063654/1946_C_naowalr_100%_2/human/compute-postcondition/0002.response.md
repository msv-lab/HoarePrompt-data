The only object in the loop head is the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. Since this is a call to read an integer from standard input, it cannot be directly adjusted. However, for the loop to execute one more time, the next integer read from standard input must also be greater than 0.

State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0, `solve()` has been called.**
