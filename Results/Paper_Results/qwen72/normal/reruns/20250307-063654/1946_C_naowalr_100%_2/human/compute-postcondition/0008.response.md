Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer from standard input and calls the `solve` function that many times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `solve` function has been called the number of times specified by the integer read from standard input, and this integer must be greater than 0. **
