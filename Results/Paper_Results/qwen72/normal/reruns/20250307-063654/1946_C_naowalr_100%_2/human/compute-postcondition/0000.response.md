The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0. Since none of the variables in the function signature are used, the state of the function parameters does not need to be adjusted. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set to any value before the loop starts.

State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0**
