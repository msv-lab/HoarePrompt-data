Output State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0, `solve()` has been called and returned for the number of times specified by `int(sys.stdin.readline())`.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will have executed the `solve()` function the exact number of times specified by the integer read from the standard input. Each call to `solve()` must have completed successfully for the loop to continue to the next iteration. If the integer read from the standard input is 0 or negative, the loop would not have executed at all.
