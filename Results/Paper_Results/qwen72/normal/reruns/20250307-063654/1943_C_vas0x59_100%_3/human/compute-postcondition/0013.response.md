Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2000, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now includes `v` and `v` as its elements, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes `u + 1` and `u` as its elements.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 3 and 2000.
- The value of `u` remains decreased by 1.
- The value of `v` remains decreased by 1.
- The list `u2vs[u]` still includes `v` and `v` as its elements.
- The list `u2vs[v]` now includes `u + 1` and `u` as its elements, because `u` was appended to the list `u2vs[v]`.
