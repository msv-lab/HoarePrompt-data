Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function.**

Explanation:
- The variable `b` is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, so `b` will have the same value as `a`.
- The other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `d`, and `previous`) are not affected by the code snippet.
