Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads the number of vertices `n` and the edges of a tree from the standard input. It constructs an adjacency list `u2vs` representing the tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from node 0 to find a node `a`, and another BFS starting from node `a` to find a node `b`. The function constructs a list `path_ba` representing the shortest path from node `b` to node 0 in reverse order. Depending on the length of `path_ba`, it generates a list of operations `ops` where each operation is a tuple. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the middle node in `path_ba`. If the length is even, `ops` contains alternating tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `c1` and `c2` are the two middle nodes in `path_ba`, and `i` is an odd number starting from 1. The function prints the number of operations in `ops` and then prints each operation in the format `node_index + 1 index`. Finally, the function returns `None`. **
