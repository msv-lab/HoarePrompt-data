The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `ci`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `ci + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `ci` is at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `ci` must still be at least 0, ensuring that `i` is less than `ci + 1`.

State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order, and must have at least one element, `i` is 2, `ci` is at least 0, `ops` has the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)` appended to it.**
