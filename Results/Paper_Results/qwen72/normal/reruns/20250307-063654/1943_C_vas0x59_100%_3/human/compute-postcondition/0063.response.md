Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing at least 4 + `ci1` node indices, `i` is 3, `ops` has three new tuples appended to it: `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, and `(c1, 3)`**. 

The code snippet `ops.append((c1, i))` adds a new tuple `(c1, 3)` to the list `ops`. The initial state specified that `ops` already had two tuples appended to it: `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`. After executing the code, `ops` now contains three tuples. The values of `path_ba` and `i` remain unchanged.
