Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the value of `previous[b]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`, `n`, and the new value `n`. If `n` == -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`, the new value `n`, and the new value `n`, and now the new value `n` is appended to `path_ba`. If the new value of `n` is -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of `n` and `path_ba`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
