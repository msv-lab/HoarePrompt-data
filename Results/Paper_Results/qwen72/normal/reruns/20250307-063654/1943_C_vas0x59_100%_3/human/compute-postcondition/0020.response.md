Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is only used to determine the number of iterations of the loop and is not modified within the loop.
- **`u2vs`**: After the loop has executed `n-1` times, `u2vs` will be a list of `n` lists. Each of these lists contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the corresponding node. For example, if node 1 (index 0) is connected to nodes 2 and 3 (indices 1 and 2), then `u2vs[0]` will contain `[1, 2]`. Similarly, `u2vs[1]` will contain `[0]` if node 2 is connected to node 1, and `u2vs[2]` will contain `[0]` if node 3 is connected to node 1.

The loop constructs an adjacency list representation of a tree, where each node is represented by an index from 0 to `n-1`, and each list in `u2vs` contains the indices of the nodes that are directly connected to it.
