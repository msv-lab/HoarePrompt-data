Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order, and must have at least one element, `i` is 2, `ci` is at least 0, `ops` has the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)` appended to it.**

The code appends the tuple `(c, 2)` to the list `ops`, which already contains the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`. The values of `path_ba`, `i`, and `ci` remain unchanged. The list `ops` now includes these three tuples.
