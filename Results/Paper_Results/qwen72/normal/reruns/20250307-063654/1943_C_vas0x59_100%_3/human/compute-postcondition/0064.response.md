Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing at least 4 + `ci1` node indices, `i` is 3, `ops` has four new tuples appended to it: `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`**. 

The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 3, the new tuple is `(c2, 3)`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
