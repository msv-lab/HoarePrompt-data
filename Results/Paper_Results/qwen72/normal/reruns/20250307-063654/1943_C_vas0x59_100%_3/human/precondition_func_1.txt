The function does not take any parameters, but it reads input values from the standard input. The first input is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree. The subsequent n - 1 inputs are pairs of integers (u, v) (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree.
