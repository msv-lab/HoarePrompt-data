Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional block it is inside, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial state information remains valid, and the only additional information is that the program has broken out of the loop or if statement.
