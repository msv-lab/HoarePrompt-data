Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2000, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now includes `v` and `v` as its elements, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes `u + 1` as one of its elements.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`. Since `u2vs[u]` already includes `v` as one of its elements, after the code execution, `u2vs[u]` will include `v` twice. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
