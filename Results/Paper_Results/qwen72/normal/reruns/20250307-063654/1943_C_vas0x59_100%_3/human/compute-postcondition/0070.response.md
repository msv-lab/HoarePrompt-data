Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order.
   - The value of `n` is -1.
   - The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, and `previous`) remain unchanged.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`, and `i` is `ci + 1`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `i` is the last odd index in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, inclusive, and `ops` has a total of `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` tuples appended to it, with each pair of tuples being `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `i` is an odd number starting from 1 and incrementing by 2.

2. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`:**
   - We need to consider two cases: when the length of `path_ba` is odd and when it is even.

3. **Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is Odd:**
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`.
   - The number of tuples in `ops` will be `ci + 1`.

4. **Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is Even:**
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `i` is the last odd index in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, inclusive.
   - The number of tuples in `ops` will be `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.

5. **Calculate the Length of `ops`:**
   - For the odd case, the length of `ops` is `ci + 1`.
   - For the even case, the length of `ops` is `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.

Since the exact values of `ci` and `ci1` are not provided, we need to express the output in terms of these variables.

**Output:**
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the output will be `ci + 1`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, the output will be `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is `ci + 1` if the length of `path_ba` is odd, and `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` if the length of `path_ba` is even)**
