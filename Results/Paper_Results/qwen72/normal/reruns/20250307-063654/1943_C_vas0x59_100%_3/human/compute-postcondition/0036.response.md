Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`, `n`, and the new value `n`. If `n` == -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The value of `n` is appended to the list `path_ba`, so `path_ba` now contains the values `b`, the original `n`, and the new `n`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. If `n` is -1, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
