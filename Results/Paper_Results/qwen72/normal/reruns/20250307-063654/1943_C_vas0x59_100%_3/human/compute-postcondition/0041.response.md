Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`, the new value `n`, and the new value `n`, and now the new value `n` is appended to `path_ba`. If the new value of `n` is -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of `n` and `path_ba`.**
