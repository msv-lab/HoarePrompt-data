Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order. `i` is the last odd index in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, inclusive. `ops` has a total of `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` tuples appended to it, with each pair of tuples being `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `i` is an odd number starting from 1 and incrementing by 2.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the `path_ba` list remains unchanged, containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0 in reverse order. The variable `i` will be the last odd number in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`. The `ops` list will have a total of `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` tuples appended to it, with each pair of tuples being `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2 for each iteration. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, and `previous`) remain unchanged.
