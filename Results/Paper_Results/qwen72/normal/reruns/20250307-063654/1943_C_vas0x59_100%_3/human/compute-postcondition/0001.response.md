Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, and the subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree. `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `u2vs` with `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is an empty list, and there are `n` such elements. The initial state information about `n` and the subsequent inputs remains unchanged.
