Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function.**

The value of `n` and the structure of `u2vs` remain unchanged. The variable `d` now holds the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function. The underscore `_` indicates that the second return value from the `bfs` function is ignored.
