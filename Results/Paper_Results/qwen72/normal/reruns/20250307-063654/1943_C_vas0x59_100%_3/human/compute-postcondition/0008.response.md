The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`. The loop can execute one more time if the current range, which is `n - 1`, still has iterations left. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2000. Since the loop has already run once, the number of iterations left is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n - 2` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2000, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now includes `v` as one of its elements, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes `u` as one of its elements.**
