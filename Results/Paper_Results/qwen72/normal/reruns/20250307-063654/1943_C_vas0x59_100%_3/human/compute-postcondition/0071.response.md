To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step.

### Initial State:
- `path_ba` is a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order.
- The value of `n` is -1.
- The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, and `previous`) remain unchanged.
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`, and `i` is `ci + 1`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, `i` is the last odd index in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, inclusive, and `ops` has a total of `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` tuples appended to it, with each pair of tuples being `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `i` is an odd number starting from 1 and incrementing by 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - We need to check if the length of `path_ba` is odd or even to understand how `ops` is constructed.

2. **Construct `ops` Based on the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - **If the length of `path_ba` is odd**:
     - `ops` contains tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`.
     - `i` is `ci + 1`.
   - **If the length of `path_ba` is even**:
     - `i` is the last odd index in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, inclusive.
     - `ops` has a total of `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` tuples appended to it, with each pair of tuples being `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `i` is an odd number starting from 1 and incrementing by 2.

3. **Map and Print the Tuples**:
   - The `map` function applies the lambda function to each tuple in `ops`.
   - The lambda function converts each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` to a string in the format `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`.
   - The `print` function then prints each of these strings separated by a newline.

### Example Scenarios:
- **Odd Length of `path_ba`**:
  - Suppose `path_ba = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (length is 5, which is odd).
  - `ops` will contain tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`.
  - If `ci` is 4, then `ops` will be `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2), (c, 3), (c, 4)]`.
  - The `print` statement will output:
    ```
    c + 1 0
    c + 1 1
    c + 1 2
    c + 1 3
    c + 1 4
    ```

- **Even Length of `path_ba`**:
  - Suppose `path_ba = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (length is 6, which is even).
  - `i` will be the last odd index in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.
  - If `ci1` is 1, then `i` will be the last odd index in the range from 1 to 4, which is 3.
  - `ops` will have a total of `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` tuples appended to it, which is 4 tuples.
  - If `c1` and `c2` are constants, say `c1 = 1` and `c2 = 2`, then `ops` will be `[(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3)]`.
  - The `print` statement will output:
    ```
    2 1
    3 1
    2 3
    3 3
    ```

### General Output:
Since the exact values of `c`, `ci`, `c1`, `c2`, and `ci1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

- **If the length of `path_ba` is odd**:
  - Output: **c + 1 0
             c + 1 1
             c + 1 2
             ...
             c + 1 ci**
  - Where `ci` is the last index in the range from 0 to `len(path_ba) - 1`.

- **If the length of `path_ba` is even**:
  - Output: **c1 + 1 1
             c2 + 1 1
             c1 + 1 3
             c2 + 1 3
             ...
             c1 + 1 i
             c2 + 1 i**
  - Where `i` is the last odd index in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **c + 1 0
         c + 1 1
         c + 1 2
         ...
         c + 1 ci (if the length of `path_ba` is odd)
         or
         c1 + 1 1
         c2 + 1 1
         c1 + 1 3
         c2 + 1 3
         ...
         c1 + 1 i
         c2 + 1 i (if the length of `path_ba` is even)**

Where `ci` is the last index in the range from 0 to `len(path_ba) - 1` for odd lengths, and `i` is the last odd index in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` for even lengths.
