The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the expression `n - 1`, which depends on the variable `n`. The loop can execute one more time if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 3 and 2000. Since the loop has already run `n - 1` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, but since `n` is between 3 and 2000, it still satisfies this condition. However, the loop counter (implied by `n - 1`) should be adjusted to reflect that the loop has run one more time.

Given that `n` is an integer between 3 and 2000 at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop has run `n - 1` times, the loop can execute one more time if `n` is still greater than 1. Since `n` is between 3 and 2000, it will still be greater than 1. The loop counter should be adjusted to `n - 2` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2000, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now includes `v` and `v` as its elements, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes `u + 1` and `u` as its elements, `n` must be greater than 2**
