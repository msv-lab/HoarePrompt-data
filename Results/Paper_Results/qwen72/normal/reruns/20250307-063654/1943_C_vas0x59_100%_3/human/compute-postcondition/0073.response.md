The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input values from the standard input. The first input is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3), which represents the number of vertices in a tree. The subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v), representing the edges of the tree. The function processes these inputs and returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of vertices `n` and the edges of a tree from the standard input, processes this information, and returns `None`.**
