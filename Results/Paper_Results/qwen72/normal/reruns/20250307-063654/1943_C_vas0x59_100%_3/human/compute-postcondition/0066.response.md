Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing at least 6 + `ci1` node indices, `i` is 5, `ops` has five new tuples appended to it: `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, and `(c1, 5)`**

The code snippet `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a new tuple `(c1, 5)` to the list `ops`. The initial state specified that `ops` had four new tuples appended to it: `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`. After executing the code, `ops` now contains these four tuples plus the new tuple `(c1, 5)`. The value of `i` remains 5, and the list `path_ba` still contains at least 6 + `ci1` node indices.
