Output State: **The loop will continue to append the previous node in the shortest path to `path_ba` until it reaches the starting node (node 0) or a node with no previous node (indicated by -1). The final state of `path_ba` will be a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order. The value of `n` will be -1, indicating that the loop has reached the end of the path. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, and `previous`) will remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop keeps adding the previous node in the shortest path to the `path_ba` list.
- It stops when it reaches the starting node (node 0) or a node with no previous node (indicated by -1).
- The final `path_ba` list will contain the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, but in reverse order (from `b` to 0).
- The value of `n` will be -1, which is the condition that breaks the loop.
- All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, and `previous`) will remain the same as they were before the loop started.
