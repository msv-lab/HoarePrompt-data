Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will continue to append the previous node in the shortest path to `path_ba` until it reaches the starting node (node 0) or a node with no previous node (indicated by -1). The final state of `path_ba` will be a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order. The value of `n` will be -1, indicating that the loop has reached the end of the path. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, and `previous`) will remain unchanged. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`. `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`. `c1` is the node index at the position `ci1` in `path_ba`. `c2` is the node index at the position `ci2` in `path_ba`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path_ba` is a list containing at least 2 node indices, `i` is 1, `ops` has two new tuples appended to it: `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `path_ba` is a list containing at least 4 + `ci1` node indices, `i` is 3, `ops` has four new tuples appended to it: `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `path_ba` is a list containing at least 6 + `ci1` node indices, `i` is 5, `ops` has six new tuples appended to it: `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
