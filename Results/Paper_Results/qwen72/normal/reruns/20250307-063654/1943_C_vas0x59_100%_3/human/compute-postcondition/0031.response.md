Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[b]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b` and `n`.**

Explanation:
- `path_ba.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`.
- The initial state indicates that `path_ba` initially contains the value of `b`.
- After appending `n` to `path_ba`, the list now contains both the value of `b` and the value of `n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`) remain unchanged.
