Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2000, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now includes `v + 1`, `v`, and `v` as its elements, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes `u + 1`, `u`, and `u` as its elements, `n` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `u` remains unchanged.
- The value of `v` remains unchanged.
- The list `u2vs[u]` remains unchanged.
- The list `u2vs[v]` now includes an additional element, `u`, making it a list that includes `u + 1`, `u`, and `u` as its elements.
