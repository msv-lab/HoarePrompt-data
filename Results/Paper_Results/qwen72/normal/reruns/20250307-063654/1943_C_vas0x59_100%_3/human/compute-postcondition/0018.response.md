Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2000, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now includes `v + 1`, `v`, and `v` as its elements, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes `u + 1` and `u` as its elements, `n` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 3 and 2000.
- The value of `u` remains the first integer input minus 1.
- The value of `v` remains the second integer input minus 1.
- The list `u2vs[u]` initially contains `v + 1` and `v`. After executing `u2vs[u].append(v)`, the list `u2vs[u]` now includes `v + 1`, `v`, and `v` as its elements.
- The list `u2vs[v]` remains unchanged and still includes `u + 1` and `u` as its elements.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
