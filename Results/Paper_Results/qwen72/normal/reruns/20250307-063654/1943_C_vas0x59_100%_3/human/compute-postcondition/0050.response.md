The code appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 1 and `ops` already has a tuple `(c, 0)` appended to it, the new tuple `(c, 1)` is added to `ops`. The other variables `path_ba` and `ci` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `path_ba` is a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order, and must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `ci` is at least 0, `ops` has the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)` appended to it.
