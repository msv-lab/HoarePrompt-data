You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters, but it reads input values from the standard input. The first input is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree. The subsequent n - 1 inputs are pairs of integers (u, v) (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: The loop will continue to append the previous node in the shortest path to `path_ba` until it reaches the starting node (node 0) or a node with no previous node (indicated by -1). The final state of `path_ba` will be a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order. The value of `n` will be -1, indicating that the loop has reached the end of the path. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, and `previous`) will remain unchanged.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: `ops` contains tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`, and `i` is `ci + 1`.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: `path_ba` is a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order. `i` is the last odd index in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, inclusive. `ops` has a total of `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` tuples appended to it, with each pair of tuples being `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `i` is an odd number starting from 1 and incrementing by 2.
    #State: *`path_ba` is a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order. The value of `n` is -1. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, and `previous`) remain unchanged. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`, and `i` is `ci + 1`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `i` is the last odd index in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, inclusive, and `ops` has a total of `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` tuples appended to it, with each pair of tuples being `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `i` is an odd number starting from 1 and incrementing by 2.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the output will be `ci + 1`.
    #- If the length of `path_ba` is even, the output will be `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output is:
    #Output:
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: c + 1 0
    #         c + 1 1
    #         c + 1 2
    #         ...
    #         c + 1 ci (if the length of `path_ba` is odd)
    #         or
    #         c1 + 1 1
    #         c2 + 1 1
    #         c1 + 1 3
    #         c2 + 1 3
    #         ...
    #         c1 + 1 i
    #         c2 + 1 i (if the length of `path_ba` is even)
    return None
    #The program returns `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads the number of vertices `n` and the edges of a tree from the standard input, processes this information, and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `None`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
