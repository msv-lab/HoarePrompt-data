Postcondition: ***`path_ba` is a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order. The value of `n` is -1. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, and `previous`) remain unchanged. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`, and `i` is `ci + 1`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `i` is the last odd index in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, inclusive, and `ops` has a total of `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` tuples appended to it, with each pair of tuples being `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `i` is an odd number starting from 1 and incrementing by 2.***
