Since the `while` loop in the given task is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement within the loop body. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`**
