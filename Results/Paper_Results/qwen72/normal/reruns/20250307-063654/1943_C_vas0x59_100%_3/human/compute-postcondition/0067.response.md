Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing at least 6 + `ci1` node indices, `i` is 5, `ops` has six new tuples appended to it: `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 5, the new tuple appended is `(c2, 5)`. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, `ops` now contains six new tuples.
