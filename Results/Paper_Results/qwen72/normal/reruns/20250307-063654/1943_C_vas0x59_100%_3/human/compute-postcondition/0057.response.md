Output State: **The loop will continue to append the previous node in the shortest path to `path_ba` until it reaches the starting node (node 0) or a node with no previous node (indicated by -1). The final state of `path_ba` will be a list containing the node indices in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order. The value of `n` will be -1, indicating that the loop has reached the end of the path. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, and `previous`) will remain unchanged. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`. `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`. `c1` is the node index at the position `ci1` in `path_ba`.**
