The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `range(n - 1)`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 2. The variable `_` is a dummy variable that is not used within the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `u2vs` is not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted here.

Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, and for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2000**
