Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[b]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices (decreased by 1) of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the list of previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by the `bfs` function, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` is updated to the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.
- Since `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`, `path_ba[-1]` is `b`.
- Therefore, `n` is now the value of `previous[b]`.
- All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `b`, `previous`, `path_ba`) remain unchanged.
