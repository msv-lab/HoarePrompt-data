Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2000, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now includes `v` as one of its elements, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes `u` as one of its elements.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The values of `u` and `v` are both decreased by 1, as specified in the initial state.
- `u2vs[u]` is a list that already includes `v` as one of its elements, as specified in the initial state.
- The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`, so `u2vs[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements.
