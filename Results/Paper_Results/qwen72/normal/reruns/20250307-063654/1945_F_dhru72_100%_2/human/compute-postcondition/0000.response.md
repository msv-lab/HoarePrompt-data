The code snippet `T = TypeVar('T')` introduces a type variable `T` using the `TypeVar` function, which is typically used in type hints to specify generic types. However, this operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of the type variable `T`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `v` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `T` is a type variable.**
