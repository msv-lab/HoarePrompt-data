### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the password `n` and the password itself from the list, updating the index accordingly.
   - This part of the program is correct and accurately processes the input.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating the password.
   - It initializes two lists, `digits` and `letters`, to store the digits and letters found in the password, respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - This part correctly separates the digits and letters from the password.

3. **Condition 2: No Digit After a Letter:**
   - The program uses `last_digit_index` to track the last index where a digit was found.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), the function immediately returns `'NO'`.
   - This logic ensures that no digit comes after a letter, which is correct.

4. **Condition 3: Digits Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - If the `digits` list is not sorted, it returns `'NO'`.
   - This check is correct and ensures that all digits are in the required order.

5. **Condition 4: Letters Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order:**
   - Similarly, the program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - If the `letters` list is not sorted, it returns `'NO'`.
   - This check is correct and ensures that all letters are in the required order.

6. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, each on a new line.
   - This part of the program is correct and accurately processes the output.

### Edge Cases:
- **Only Digits or Only Letters:** The program handles these cases correctly because the `digits` and `letters` lists will be empty for one of the types, and an empty list is considered sorted.
- **Mixed Characters:** The program correctly identifies and separates digits and letters, and applies the sorting and order checks as required.

### Annotations Validation:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
  - Before the function call, `password` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
  - After the first loop, `digits` and `letters` contain the respective characters in the order they appear.
  - The `last_digit_index` logic correctly identifies if a digit is followed by a letter.
  - The sorting checks are applied correctly to `digits` and `letters`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the required conditions for a strong password as described in the problem. It handles the input and output as expected and performs the necessary checks to validate the password.

Correctness: **True**
