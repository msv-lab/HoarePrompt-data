The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more characters in `password` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the second character of `password`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be the third character of `password`.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 3 and 20 inclusive. `char` is the third character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list, and `letters` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `password`.**
