Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 3 and 20 inclusive. `char` is the third character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list, and `letters` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `password`. `letters` now contains the third character of `password` appended to it.**
