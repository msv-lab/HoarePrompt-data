Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear. `last_digit_index` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i, char in enumerate(password):
    if char.isdigit():
        last_digit_index = i
    elif last_digit_index != -1:
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `password`. If the first character of `password` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 0. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 2 and 20 inclusive. `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 1. If `char` is not a digit and the first character of `password` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 0 and the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 3 and 20 inclusive. `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 2. If `char` is not a digit and the second character of `password` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 1 and the program returns 'NO'. If `char` is not a digit and the second character of `password` is not a digit, `last_digit_index` is -1 and the program does not return 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
