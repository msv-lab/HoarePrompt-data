Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by reading the length of the password and the password itself from the list. This approach is efficient and correct for the given problem.

2. **Character Segregation**: The function `func_1` segregates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This ensures that we can separately check the sorting conditions for digits and letters.

3. **Digit and Letter Order Check**:
   - The program checks if any letter follows a digit. If it finds such a case, it immediately returns 'NO'. This is correct because it enforces the rule that no letter should come after a digit.
   - The program then checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Final Return**: If the password passes all the checks, the function returns 'YES'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles passwords that contain only letters or only digits.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem guarantees that the length is between 1 and 20).

6. **Overall Logic**: The logic of the program is sound and follows the problem description accurately. The conditions are checked in the correct order, and the program handles all the specified constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
