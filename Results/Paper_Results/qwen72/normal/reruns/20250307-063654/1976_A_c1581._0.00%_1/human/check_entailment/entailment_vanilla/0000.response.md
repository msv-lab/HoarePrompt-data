### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the password `n` and the password itself from the list, updating the index accordingly.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating the password.
   - It initializes two lists, `digits` and `letters`, to store the digits and letters found in the password, respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - It also keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), the function immediately returns `'NO'` because this violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter.
   - After the loop, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - If all conditions are satisfied, it returns `'YES'`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, each on a new line.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
  - This is implicitly handled by the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` checks in the loop.
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
  - This is checked by the `last_digit_index` logic.
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - This is checked by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - This is checked by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Password:** The problem description guarantees that the password length `n` is at least 1, so this case is not applicable.
- **Only Digits or Only Letters:** The program handles these cases correctly because the `digits` and `letters` lists will be empty for one of the types, and an empty list is considered sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the required conditions for a strong password as described in the problem. It handles the input and output as expected and performs the necessary checks to validate the password.

Correctness: **True**
