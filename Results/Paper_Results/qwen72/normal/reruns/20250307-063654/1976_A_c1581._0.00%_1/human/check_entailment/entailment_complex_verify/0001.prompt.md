You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `password` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. If `password` contains at least one digit and no lowercase Latin letter immediately follows a digit, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password`. If `password` contains a lowercase Latin letter immediately following a digit, the loop returns 'NO' and the program terminates. If `password` contains no digits, `last_digit_index` remains -1.

        return 'NO'

    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `password` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. It returns 'YES' if the password meets the following criteria: all digits in the password are in sorted order, all lowercase Latin letters in the password are in sorted order, and no lowercase Latin letter immediately follows a digit. If any of these criteria are not met, the function returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the password `n` and the password itself from the list, updating the index accordingly.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating the password.
   - It initializes two lists, `digits` and `letters`, to store the digits and letters found in the password, respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - It also keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), the function immediately returns `'NO'` because this violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter.
   - After the loop, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns `'NO'`.
   - If all conditions are satisfied, it returns `'YES'`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, each on a new line.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
  - This is implicitly handled by the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` checks in the loop.
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
  - This is checked by the `last_digit_index` logic.
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - This is checked by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - This is checked by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Password:** The problem description guarantees that the password length `n` is at least 1, so this case is not applicable.
- **Only Digits or Only Letters:** The program handles these cases correctly because the `digits` and `letters` lists will be empty for one of the types, and an empty list is considered sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the required conditions for a strong password as described in the problem. It handles the input and output as expected and performs the necessary checks to validate the password.
