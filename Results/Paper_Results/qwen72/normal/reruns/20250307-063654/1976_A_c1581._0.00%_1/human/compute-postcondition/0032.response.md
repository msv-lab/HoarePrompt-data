Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 3 and 20 inclusive. `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 2. If `char` is not a digit and the second character of `password` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 1 and the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `last_digit_index = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `last_digit_index`.
- The initial conditions are still valid: `password` is a string of lowercase Latin letters and digits with a length between 3 and 20, `i` is 2, and `char` is the third character of `password`.
- If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 2, which matches the assignment in the code.
- If `char` is not a digit and the second character of `password` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 1, but the code snippet does not change this condition, so it remains as is.
- If neither of the above conditions is true, `last_digit_index` is -1, but the code snippet does not change this condition, so it remains as is.
- The program does not return anything in the given code snippet, so the return condition remains unchanged.
