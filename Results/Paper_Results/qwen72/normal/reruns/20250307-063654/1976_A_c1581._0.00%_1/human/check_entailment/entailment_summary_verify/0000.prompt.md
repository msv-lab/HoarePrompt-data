You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `password` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. It returns 'YES' if the password meets the following criteria: all digits in the password are in sorted order, all lowercase Latin letters in the password are in sorted order, and no lowercase Latin letter immediately follows a digit. If any of these criteria are not met, the function returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly verifies if a password meets the specified conditions for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The program separates the digits and letters from the password into two lists, `digits` and `letters`.

2. **Check for Digits After Letters**: The program ensures that no digit comes after a letter by tracking the last index of a digit (`last_digit_index`). If a letter is found after a digit, it immediately returns "NO".

3. **Check for Sorted Digits and Letters**: The program checks if the `digits` list and the `letters` list are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns "NO".

4. **Return "YES" if All Conditions Met**: If all conditions are met, the program returns "YES".

The program handles all edge cases, including:
- Passwords with only letters.
- Passwords with only digits.
- Passwords with both letters and digits.
- Passwords where digits and letters are not in the correct order.
- Passwords where a digit comes after a letter.

Since the program meets all the requirements and there are no apparent edge cases where it fails, it is considered correct.
