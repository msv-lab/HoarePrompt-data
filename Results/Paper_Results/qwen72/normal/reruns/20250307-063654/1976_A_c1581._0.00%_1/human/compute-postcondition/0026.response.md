The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `char`, and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `password`. If `i` is less than the length of `password`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `password`, and `last_digit_index` is either 0 or -1 depending on whether the first character is a digit.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. The next character in `password` will be assigned to `char`, so `char` will be the second character of `password`. The length of `password` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 2 and 20 inclusive. `i` is 1, `char` is the second character of `password`. If the first character of `password` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 0. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is -1.**
