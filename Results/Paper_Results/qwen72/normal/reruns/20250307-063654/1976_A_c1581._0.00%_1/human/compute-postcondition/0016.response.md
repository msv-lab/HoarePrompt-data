Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `digits` list will contain all the characters from the `password` string that are digits, in the same order they appear in the `password`. Similarly, the `letters` list will contain all the characters from the `password` string that are lowercase Latin letters, in the same order they appear in the `password`. The `password` string itself remains unchanged.
