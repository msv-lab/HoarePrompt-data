Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 3 and 20 inclusive. `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 2. If `char` is not a digit and the second character of `password` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 1 and the program returns 'NO'. If `char` is not a digit and the second character of `password` is not a digit, `last_digit_index` is -1 and the program does not return 'NO'.**
