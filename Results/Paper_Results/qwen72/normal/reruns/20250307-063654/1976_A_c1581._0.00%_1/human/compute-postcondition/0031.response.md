The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `char`, and the string `password`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `password` and the current value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 2 and 20 inclusive.
- `i` is 1.
- `char` is the second character of `password`.
- If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 1.
- If `char` is not a digit and the first character of `password` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 0 and the program returns 'NO'.
- Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is -1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 2.
- `char` must be the third character of `password`.
- The length of `password` must be at least 3 to ensure that the loop can execute again.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 3 and 20 inclusive. `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 2. If `char` is not a digit and the second character of `password` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 1 and the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `last_digit_index` is -1.**
