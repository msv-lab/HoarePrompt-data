The only objects in the loop head are `char` and `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If the `password` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. This means the loop will execute if `password` is not empty.

For the loop to execute, `password` must have at least one character, and `char` will be the first character of `password`.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive, `char` is the first character of `password`, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list**
