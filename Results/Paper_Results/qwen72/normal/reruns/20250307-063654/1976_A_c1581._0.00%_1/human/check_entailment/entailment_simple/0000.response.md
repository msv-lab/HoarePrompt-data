### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the password string.
   - This part of the program correctly handles the input format as described in the problem statement.

2. **Character Separation**:
   - The program separates the characters in the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - This ensures that we can independently check the sorting conditions for digits and letters.

3. **Digit and Letter Order**:
   - The program checks if any digit is followed by a letter. If it finds such a case, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - This correctly enforces the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

4. **Sorting Check**:
   - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - These checks ensure that the digits and letters in the password are sorted as required.

5. **Output**:
   - If the password passes all the checks, the program returns 'YES'.
   - The results are collected in a list and printed at the end of the program.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- It handles the input and output formats as described.
- The logic for checking the conditions is sound and correctly implemented.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
