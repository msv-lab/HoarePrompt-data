Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 3 and 20 inclusive. `char` is the third character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list. If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` is an empty list, and `letters` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `password`. In both cases, `digits` now contains the third character of `password` as well.**

Explanation:
- The code `digits.append(char)` adds the third character of `password` to the `digits` list.
- If `char` is a digit, `digits` was already a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `password`. After appending `char`, `digits` still contains the first, second, and third characters of `password`, but now the third character is appended again, making it appear twice.
- If `char` is a lowercase Latin letter, `digits` was initially an empty list. After appending `char`, `digits` now contains the third character of `password`.
- The value of `letters` remains unchanged, as the code only affects `digits`.
