Postcondition: **After the loop executes all iterations, `password` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with a length between 1 and 20 inclusive. If `password` contains at least one digit and no lowercase Latin letter immediately follows a digit, `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in `password`. If `password` contains a lowercase Latin letter immediately following a digit, the loop returns 'NO' and the program terminates. If `password` contains no digits, `last_digit_index` remains -1. Additionally, the digits in `password` are in sorted order.**
