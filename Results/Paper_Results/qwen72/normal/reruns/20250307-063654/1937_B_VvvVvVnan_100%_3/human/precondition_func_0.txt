The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take the number of test cases t, the dimensions of the grid n, and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid as inputs. Correct function definition should be: `def find_smallest_string_and_paths(t, n, row1, row2):` where t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and row1, row2 are binary strings of length n.
