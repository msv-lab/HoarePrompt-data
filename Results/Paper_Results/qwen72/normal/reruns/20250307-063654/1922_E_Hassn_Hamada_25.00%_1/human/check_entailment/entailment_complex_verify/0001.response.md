### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 such that the array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array should be constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers that will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function works by recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`.
   - It first checks if `number` is 0, in which case it returns 0, indicating that no more elements need to be added to the sequence.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number` and adds a sequence of integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
   - The function then recursively calls itself with the updated `number` and `sequence`.
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the last `result` elements of the `sequence` by adding `result` to them.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed by adding a series of integers and then modifying them to ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).
   - The modification step ensures that the sequence remains valid and the number of increasing subsequences is correctly counted.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `number` is 0 correctly by returning 0.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by recursively breaking down the problem.

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The sequence is constructed to have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, as verified by the recursive calls and modifications.

7. **Example Verification**:
   - For \( X = 2 \), the program outputs:
     ```
     1
     0
     ```
     This is correct because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
   - For \( X = 5 \), the program outputs:
     ```
     3
     0 1 0
     ```
     This is incorrect. The array `[0, 1, 0]` has the following increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0]` (the last `[0]` is the same as the first `[0]` and should not be counted twice). Therefore, the correct number of increasing subsequences is 4, not 5.
   - For \( X = 13 \), the program outputs:
     ```
     5
     2 2 3 4 2
     ```
     This is incorrect. The array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has the following increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[2]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`, `[2]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, `[3, 4]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, and `[2, 3, 4]` (some subsequences are counted multiple times due to repeated elements). Therefore, the correct number of increasing subsequences is not 13.
   - For \( X = 37 \), the program outputs:
     ```
     7
     -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
     ```
     This is incorrect. The array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has the following increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[-1]`, `[-1]`, `[0]`, `[0]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[-1]`, `[-1, 0]`, `[-1, 0]`, `[0, 2]`, `[0, 3]`, `[0, 2]`, `[0, 3]`, `[2, 3]`, `[-1, 0, 2]`, `[-1, 0, 3]`, `[-1, 0, 2]`, `[-1, 0, 3]`, `[0, 2, 3]`, `[-1, 0, 2, 3]`, and `[-1, 0, 2, 3]` (some subsequences are counted multiple times due to repeated elements). Therefore, the correct number of increasing subsequences is not 37.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given test cases. The recursive approach and sequence modification do not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is accurately counted, especially when the array contains repeated elements. The examples provided in the original assessment are incorrect.

Final: **False**
