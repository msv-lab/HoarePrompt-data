The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `size` must still be greater than `i`, which means `size` must be greater than 1.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 201, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last element is 0, `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
