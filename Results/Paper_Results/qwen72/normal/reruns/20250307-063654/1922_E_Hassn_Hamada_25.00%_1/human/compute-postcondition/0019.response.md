Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 200 + `size`, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0, `i` is `size` - 1, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**.
