The code snippet `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` increments the element at the index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` by the value of `result`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `size` must be greater than 1, and the element at index `-result - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`, the new index to be incremented is `-result - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `-result - 2`. Therefore, the element at index `-result - 2` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `size` must be greater than 1, the element at index `-result - 2` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.**
