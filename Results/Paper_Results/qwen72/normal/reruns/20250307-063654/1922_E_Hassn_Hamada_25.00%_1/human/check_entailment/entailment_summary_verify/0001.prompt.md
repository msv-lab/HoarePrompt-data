You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest integer `size` such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\). It then appends the integers from 0 to `size` - 1 to the `sequence` list. The function recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and the modified `sequence`. After the recursive call, it increments the last `result` elements of the `sequence` by the value of `result`. Finally, the function returns the sum of `size` and `result`. The `sequence` list is modified to include additional elements and some of its elements are incremented.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers with a length of at most 200 such that the array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array should be constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers that will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function works by recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`.
   - It first checks if `number` is 0, in which case it returns 0, indicating that no more elements need to be added to the sequence.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number` and adds a sequence of integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
   - The function then recursively calls itself with the updated `number` and `sequence`.
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the last `result` elements of the `sequence` by adding `result` to them.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed by adding a series of integers and then modifying them to ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).
   - The modification step ensures that the sequence remains valid and the number of increasing subsequences is correctly counted.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `number` is 0 correctly by returning 0.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by recursively breaking down the problem.

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The sequence is constructed to have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences, as verified by the recursive calls and modifications.

7. **Example Verification**:
   - For \( X = 2 \), the program outputs:
     ```
     1
     0
     ```
     This is correct because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
   - For \( X = 5 \), the program outputs:
     ```
     3
     0 1 0
     ```
     This is correct because the array `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0]`.
   - For \( X = 13 \), the program outputs:
     ```
     5
     2 2 3 4 2
     ```
     This is correct because the array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - For \( X = 37 \), the program outputs:
     ```
     7
     -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
     ```
     This is correct because the array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given test cases. The recursive approach and sequence modification ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is accurately counted and the sequence is valid.

Correctness: **True**
