The variables in the loop head are `size` and `number`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is 3 and `number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\) and `number` is not equal to 0.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` holds true after the last iteration. 

- For `size = 3`, the expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1` evaluates to `(1 << 4) - 1` which is `16 - 1 = 15`.
- Therefore, the condition `15 <= number` must be true for the loop to execute again.

Since `number` is already given to be in the range \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\) and not equal to 0, it is possible that `number` is greater than or equal to 15. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the condition to reflect that `number` must be at least 15.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 200, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), `size` is 3, and the size of the generated sequence is returned as an integer. Additionally, `number` must be greater than or equal to 15.**
