To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and `size`. The loop will execute if `size` is greater than 0, and `i` will be iterated from 0 to `size - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\)
- `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 200 + `size`, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1
- `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0
- `i` is `size` - 1
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`

For the loop to execute, `size` must be greater than 0, and `i` must start from 0 and iterate up to `size - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `i` is 0 (since the loop starts with `i` at 0)
- `size` must be greater than 0 (to ensure the loop has at least one iteration)

The other variables and objects (`number`, `sequence`, and `result`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `size` must be greater than 0**
