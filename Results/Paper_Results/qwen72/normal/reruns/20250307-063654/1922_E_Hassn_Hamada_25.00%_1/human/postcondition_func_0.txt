The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest integer `size` such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\). It then appends the integers from 0 to `size` - 1 to the `sequence` list. The function recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and the modified `sequence`. After the recursive call, it increments the last `result` elements of the `sequence` by the value of `result`. Finally, the function returns the sum of `size` and `result`. The `sequence` list is modified to include additional elements and some of its elements are incremented.
