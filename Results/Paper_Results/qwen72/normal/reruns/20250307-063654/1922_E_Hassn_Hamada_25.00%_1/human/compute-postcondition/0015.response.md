Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 202, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last element is 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code `sequence.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to the end of the `sequence` list.
- The length of `sequence` increases by 1, so it is now at most 202.
- The last element of `sequence` is now 1.
- The values of `number`, `size`, and `i` remain unchanged.
