Output State: **`i` is 2, `size` must be greater than 2, the element at index `-result - 3` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.** 

The value of `i` remains 2, and `size` must still be greater than 2. The element at index `-result - 3` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
