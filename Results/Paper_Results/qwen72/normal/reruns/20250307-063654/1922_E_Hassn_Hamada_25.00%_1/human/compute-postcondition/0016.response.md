The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must still be less than `size`.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 202, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last element is 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
