### Reasoning:

1. **Base Case**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the base case where `number` is 0. It returns 0, which is appropriate because an array with 0 increasing subsequences is an empty array, and the length of an empty array is 0.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function calculates the smallest integer `size` such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\). This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length `size` where each element is unique and strictly increasing is \(2^{\text{size}} - 1\). This is because each element can either be included or not included in a subsequence, leading to \(2^{\text{size}}\) possible subsequences, but we exclude the empty subsequence, hence \(2^{\text{size}} - 1\).
   - The function then appends the integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the `sequence`. This ensures that the sequence has a strictly increasing subsequence of length `size`.
   - The function recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and the modified `sequence`. This is because after accounting for the \(2^{\text{size}} - 1\) subsequences, we need to find a sequence that has exactly `number - (1 << size) + 1` increasing subsequences.
   - After the recursive call, the function increments the last `result` elements of the `sequence` by the value of `result`. This is done to ensure that the elements at the end of the sequence are distinct and maintain the strictly increasing property.

3. **Output**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with `n - 1` and an initially empty `sequence`.
   - It prints the length of the `sequence` and the elements of the `sequence` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `number` is 0 by returning 0.
   - The function ensures that the `sequence` length does not exceed 200 by calculating the smallest `size` such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\).

5. **Assertions**:
   - The assertion `assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` ensures that the indices being modified are within the valid range of the `sequence`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array of integers that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for the given input constraints. The logic and the recursive approach are sound, and the assertions help ensure that the indices being modified are valid.

Correctness: **True**
