Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 200 + `size`, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last `size` elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1, `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0, `i` is `size` - 1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `number` remains unchanged, still being an integer within the range from 3 to \(10^{18}\).
- The `sequence` list has been extended by `size` elements, where the new elements are the integers from 0 to `size` - 1. The total length of the `sequence` list is now at most 200 + `size`.
- The value of `size` remains the same, being the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1\) is greater than `number`, and it must be greater than 0.
- The loop variable `i` has reached the value `size` - 1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
