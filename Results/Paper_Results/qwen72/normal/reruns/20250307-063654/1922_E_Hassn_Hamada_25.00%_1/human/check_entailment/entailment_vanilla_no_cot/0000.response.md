Correctness: **True**

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of generating an array with exactly X increasing subsequences, or reporting that it's impossible. The program uses a recursive function `func_1` to build the sequence based on the input number `X`.

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X` and initializes an empty list `result` to store the sequence.

2. **Recursive Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence.
   - It starts by checking if `number` is 0, in which case it returns 0 (indicating no more elements to add).
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number + 1` and sets `size` to the exponent of this power.
   - It appends the first `size` integers (0, 1, 2, ..., size-1) to the sequence.
   - It recursively calls itself with the remaining part of `number` (i.e., `number - (1 << size) + 1`).
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the sequence to ensure the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and then the sequence itself.

### Why It's Correct:
- **Base Case**: When `number` is 0, the function returns 0, which is correct because an empty sequence has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence itself).
- **Recursive Case**: The function correctly identifies the largest power of 2 that fits into `number + 1` and uses it to build the sequence. This ensures that the sequence can be constructed to have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- **Sequence Construction**: The sequence is constructed by appending integers and then adjusting the last few elements to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.
- **Assertions**: The assertions in the function ensure that the sequence is being modified correctly and within bounds.

### Example Walkthrough:
- For `X = 2`, the sequence `[0]` is generated, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
- For `X = 5`, the sequence `[0, 1, 0]` is generated, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0]`, `[0, 1]`.
- For `X = 13`, the sequence `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` is generated, which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

The program meets the problem's requirements and handles the constraints correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
