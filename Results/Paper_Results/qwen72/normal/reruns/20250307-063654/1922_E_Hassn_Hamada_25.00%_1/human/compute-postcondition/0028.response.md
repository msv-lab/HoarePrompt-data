The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number` and `sequence`. `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the sum of `size` and `result`. Here, `size` is greater than 0, and `result` is the number of elements at the end of the `sequence` list that have been incremented.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is greater than 0, and `result` is the number of elements at the end of the `sequence` list that have been incremented.**
