The variables in the loop head are `size` and `number`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\). At the end of the last iteration, `size` is 2, and `number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\) and `number` is not equal to 0.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if the condition \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\) holds true for `size` = 2. Let's calculate the left side of the inequality:

\[
(1 << (2 + 1)) - 1 = (1 << 3) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7
\]

So, the condition is \(7 \leq \text{number}\). Given that `number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), and `number` is not equal to 0, the condition \(7 \leq \text{number}\) is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 200, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), `size` is 2, and the size of the generated sequence is returned as an integer. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0.**
