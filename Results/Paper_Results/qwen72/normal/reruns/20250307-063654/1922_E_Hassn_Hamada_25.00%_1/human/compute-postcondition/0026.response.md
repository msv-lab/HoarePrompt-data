Output State: **`i` is `size` - 1, `size` must be greater than 0, the elements at indices `-result - 1` to `-result - size` in `sequence` are each incremented by `result`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have cycled through all values from `size` - 1 down to 0. The `size` variable remains unchanged and must be greater than 0. For each iteration, the element at the index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` list is incremented by the value of `result`. Therefore, after all iterations, the elements at indices `-result - 1` to `-result - size` in the `sequence` list will each have been incremented by `result`.
