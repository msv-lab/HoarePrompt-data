The code snippet `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` modifies an element in the `sequence` list. The index of the element being modified is calculated as `-result - i - 1`, and the value at this index is incremented by `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `size` must be greater than 0

We need to determine the impact of the code on the program.

1. The value of `i` is 0.
2. The index `-result - i - 1` simplifies to `-result - 1` since `i` is 0.
3. The element at the index `-result - 1` in the `sequence` list is incremented by `result`.

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `sequence` or `result`, we can only describe the change in the list `sequence` in general terms.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `size` must be greater than 0, the element at index `-result - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.**
