Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 201, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) and the last element is 0, `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\) and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `number` remains unchanged.
- The `sequence` list has a new element appended to it, which is the value of `i` (0). Therefore, the length of `sequence` is now at most 201, and the last element of `sequence` is 0.
- The value of `size` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
