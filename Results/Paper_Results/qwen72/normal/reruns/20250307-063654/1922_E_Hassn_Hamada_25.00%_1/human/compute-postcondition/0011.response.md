Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 200, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), `size` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number}\), and the size of the generated sequence is returned as an integer. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0.**

### Explanation:
The loop continues to increment `size` by 1 as long as \( (1 << (\text{size} + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number} \). This condition can be rewritten as \( 2^{\text{size} + 1} - 1 \leq \text{number} \). The loop stops when \( 2^{\text{size} + 1} - 1 > \text{number} \).

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `size` will be the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number} \). This means that `size` will be the smallest integer for which the inequality holds true, effectively determining the smallest power of 2 that exceeds `number` by 1. The other variables (`sequence` and the size of the generated sequence) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
