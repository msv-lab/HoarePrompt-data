To determine if the loop can execute the first time, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop head: `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `size` is 1.
   - `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 200, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.
   - Let's break this down:
     - `size + 1` is 2.
     - `1 << 2` is \(1 \times 2^2 = 4\).
     - `(1 << 2) - 1` is \(4 - 1 = 3\).

3. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The loop will execute if \(3 \leq \text{number}\).
   - Given that `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), we need to ensure that `number` is at least 3 for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Adjustment Needed:**
   - Since `number` is already constrained to be at least 2, we need to ensure it is at least 3.
   - `size` is 1, and this value does not need to be adjusted because it is already set to a value that makes the loop condition valid for `number` being at least 3.

### Conclusion:
- The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `number` is at least 3.
- The state of `size` and `sequence` does not need to be modified.

### Final State:
State: **`number` is an integer such that \(3 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list of integers with length at most 200, where each element is in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), `size` is 1, and the size of the generated sequence is returned as an integer. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0.**
