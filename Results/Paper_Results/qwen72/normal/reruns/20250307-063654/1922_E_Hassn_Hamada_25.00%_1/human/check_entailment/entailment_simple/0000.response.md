### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers with at most 200 elements such that the array has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are in strictly increasing order, and the order of elements in the subsequence must be the same as in the array.
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) (which is \( X \) in the problem description).
   - It initializes an empty list `result` and calls the function `func_1` with \( n - 1 \) and `result` as arguments.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will have exactly \( n \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence:
     - It first checks if \( number \) is 0. If so, it returns 0, indicating that no more elements need to be added.
     - It then finds the smallest integer `size` such that \( 2^{\text{size}} - 1 > \text{number} \).
     - It appends the integers from 0 to `size - 1` to the sequence.
     - It recursively calls `func_1` with the updated number \( \text{number} - (1 << \text{size}) + 1 \).
     - After the recursive call, it increments the elements at the end of the sequence by the result of the recursive call.
     - Finally, it returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( n \) increasing subsequences.
   - The base case is correctly handled: if \( number \) is 0, the function returns 0, indicating that the sequence is complete.
   - The recursive approach is sound: it breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems by reducing the number of required increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is built by appending integers and then incrementing the last few elements, which ensures that the sequence remains within the required range and has the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - The assert statement ensures that the indices being modified are valid.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( n \) is 2 correctly by returning a sequence of length 1 with a single element (0).
   - For larger values of \( n \), the program generates a sequence that meets the criteria of having exactly \( n \) increasing subsequences.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. The recursive approach and the sequence generation logic are well-structured and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
