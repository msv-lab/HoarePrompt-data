Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `X` is a power of 2. For example, when `X = 4`, the program should generate an array with exactly 4 increasing subsequences. However, the function `func_1` will incorrectly generate a sequence that does not meet this requirement. The logic in `func_1` is designed to build a sequence by recursively adding elements, but it does not correctly account for the specific structure needed to ensure exactly `X` increasing subsequences when `X` is a power of 2. This results in an incorrect sequence being generated.
