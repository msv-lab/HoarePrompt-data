The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `size`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `size` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `size` must still be greater than `i`, which means `size` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `size` must be greater than 1, the element at index `-result - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`**
