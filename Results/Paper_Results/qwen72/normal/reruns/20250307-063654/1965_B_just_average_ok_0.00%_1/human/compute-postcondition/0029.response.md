Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{idx}+1} \) is greater than `k`, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

The value of `idx` is decremented by 1, so it is now the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{idx}+1} \) is greater than `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
