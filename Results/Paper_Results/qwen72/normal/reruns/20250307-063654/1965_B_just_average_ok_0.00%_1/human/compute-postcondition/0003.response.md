Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each element is a power of 2 (starting from 2^0 to 2^23), `idx` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of the variable `idx`, which is now set to 0.
