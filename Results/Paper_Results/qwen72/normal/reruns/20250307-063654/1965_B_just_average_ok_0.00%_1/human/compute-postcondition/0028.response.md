Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) is greater than `k`, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `idx` will be the smallest integer for which \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) is greater than the input integer `k`. The other variables (`nums`, `_`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
