Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `t` and `_`, along with the new values for `n` and `k` based on the input.
