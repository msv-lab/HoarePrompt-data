The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than the value of `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{idx}+1} \) is greater than `k`, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \) with `1 << idx` removed, and with `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended, `_` is incremented by 1, and `n` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and the loop can execute again if `_` is less than the value of `int(input())`. The value of `int(input())` is not modified by the loop itself, so it remains the same.

State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{idx}+1} \) is greater than `k`, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \) with `1 << idx` removed, and with `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be less than `int(input())` for the loop to execute again.**
