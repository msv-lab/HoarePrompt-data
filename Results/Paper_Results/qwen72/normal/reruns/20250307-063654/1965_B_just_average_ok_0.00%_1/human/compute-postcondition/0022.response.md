To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. Let's break down the state and the condition:

- `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `idx` is 0.
- `1 << idx` is equivalent to \(2^0\), which is 1.

Given that `idx` is 0, the condition `k >= 1 << idx` simplifies to `k >= 1`. Since `k` is already stated to be greater than or equal to 1, the condition will be true, and the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 0, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer**
