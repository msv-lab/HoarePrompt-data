Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{idx}+1} \) is greater than `k`, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \) with `1 << idx` removed, and with `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` remains an input integer greater than or equal to 1.
- The value of `idx` remains the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{idx}+1} \) is greater than `k`.
- The list `nums` originally contained powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), plus the additional elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The code `nums.remove(1 << idx)` removes the element \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) from the list.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
