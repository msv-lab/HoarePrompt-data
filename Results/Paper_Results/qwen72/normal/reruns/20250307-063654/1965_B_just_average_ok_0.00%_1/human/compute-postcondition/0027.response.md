Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 8, `idx` is 3, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer**. 

The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
