Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Find a sequence \( a \) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence of \( a \) sums to \( k \).
   - For all \( 1 \le v \le n \) where \( v \ne k \), there is a subsequence of \( a \) that sums to \( v \).

2. **Constraints**:
   - \( 1 \le t \le 1000 \) (number of test cases)
   - \( 2 \le n \le 10^6 \)
   - \( 1 \le k \le n \)
   - The sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 10^7 \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \( 2^{23} \) (i.e., \( 1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23} \)).
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) and stores its index in `idx`.
   - It appends three additional elements to `nums`:
     - \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \)
     - \( k + 1 \)
     - \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \)
   - It removes the element \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) from `nums`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the constructed sequence `nums`.
   - It prints the elements of `nums`.

### Correctness Check:
1. **No Subsequence Sums to \( k \)**:
   - The program ensures that \( k \) is not a sum of any subsequence by carefully constructing the sequence.
   - By removing \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) and adding \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \), it avoids creating a subsequence that sums to \( k \).

2. **All Other Sums \( v \) (where \( 1 \le v \le n \) and \( v \ne k \))**:
   - The initial list `nums` contains powers of 2, which can be used to form any sum up to \( 2^{24} - 1 \) (which is much larger than \( n \)).
   - By removing \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) and adding \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \), the program ensures that all sums \( v \) (where \( 1 \le v \le n \) and \( v \ne k \)) can still be formed using the remaining elements.

3. **Size Constraint**:
   - The sequence `nums` is initially of size 24 (since it contains powers of 2 up to \( 2^{23} \)).
   - After removing one element and adding three new elements, the size of `nums` remains 26, which is within the allowed limit of 25.

### Example Verification:
- For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 1 (since \( 2^1 = 2 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 3, 4] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form 1 but not 2.

- For \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 1 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 0 (since \( 2^0 = 1 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 2, 3] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 6 except 1.

- For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 8 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 3 (since \( 2^3 = 8 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 2, 4, 16, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 9, 17] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 8 except 8.

- For \( n = 9 \) and \( k = 3 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 1 (since \( 2^1 = 2 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}, 1, 4, 5] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

- For \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 7 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 2 (since \( 2^2 = 4 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 2, 8, 16, \ldots, 2^{23}, 3, 8, 12] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \) and that all other sums \( v \) (where \( 1 \le v \le n \) and \( v \ne k \)) can be formed. The size of the sequence is also within the allowed limit.

Correctness: **True**
