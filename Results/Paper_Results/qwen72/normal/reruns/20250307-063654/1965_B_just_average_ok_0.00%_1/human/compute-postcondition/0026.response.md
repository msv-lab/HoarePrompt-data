The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 2, and `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 4. The expression `1 << idx` is equivalent to \(2^{\text{idx}}\). When `idx` is 2, `1 << 2` is 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << 3`, which is 8. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 8, `idx` is 2, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer**
