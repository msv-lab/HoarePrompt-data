The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers.
- `idx` is 0.
- `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `int(input())` for the loop to execute again (this does not affect the loop condition).

For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\). Since `idx` is 0, \(1 << idx\) is \(1 << 0\), which is 1. Therefore, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers, `idx` is 0, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1**
