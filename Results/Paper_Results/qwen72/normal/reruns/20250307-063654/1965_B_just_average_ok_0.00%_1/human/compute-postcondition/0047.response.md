Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) minus 1, `k` must be a non-negative integer.**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`nums`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx` is now the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}+1} > k\), which is equivalent to saying `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) minus 1.
