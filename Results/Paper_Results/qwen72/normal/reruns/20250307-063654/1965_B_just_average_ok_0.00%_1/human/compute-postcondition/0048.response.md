Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) followed by the value \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) minus 1, `k` must be a non-negative integer.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\) to the list `nums`.
- `nums` initially contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
- `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) minus 1, so \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`.
- The value \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\) is calculated and appended to `nums`.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain the same as they were assigned from `input().split()` and converted to integers.
- The value of `idx` remains the same as it was determined based on `k`.
- `k` must still be a non-negative integer.
