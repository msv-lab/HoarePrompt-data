The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state of `t` is what determines whether the loop will run or not. The loop will run `t` times, and for that to happen, `t` must be at least 1 and at most 1000, as specified in the task.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a valid number of test cases, and the loop index `_` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0**
