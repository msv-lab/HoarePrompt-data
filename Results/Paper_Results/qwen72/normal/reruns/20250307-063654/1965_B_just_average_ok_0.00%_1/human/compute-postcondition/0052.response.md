Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), followed by the value \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + nums[\text{idx}] + 1\)**:
   - The list `nums` contains all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) except \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
   - After excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), the list is extended with three additional elements: \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + nums[\text{idx}] + 1\).

2. **`n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers**:
   - `n` and `k` are read from user input and converted to integers.

3. **`idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) minus 1**:
   - `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\), and then `idx` is decremented by 1.

### Steps to Determine the Length of `nums`:
1. **Determine the range of powers of 2**:
   - The powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) form a list of 24 elements.

2. **Find `idx`**:
   - `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\), and then `idx` is decremented by 1.
   - For example, if \(k = 15\), the smallest \(2^{\text{idx}} > 15\) is \(2^4 = 16\), so `idx` would be \(4 - 1 = 3\).

3. **Construct the list `nums`**:
   - `nums` will contain all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) except \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
   - This means `nums` will have \(24 - 1 = 23\) elements from the powers of 2.
   - Additionally, `nums` will have three more elements: \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + nums[\text{idx}] + 1\).

4. **Calculate the total length of `nums`**:
   - The total length of `nums` is \(23 + 3 = 26\).

### Final Output:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the list `nums`, which is 26.

Output: **26**
