Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) followed by the value \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\) and \(k + 1\), `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) minus 1, `k` must be a non-negative integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums.append(k + 1)` adds the value \(k + 1\) to the list `nums`.
- The initial state of `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) followed by the value \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\).
- After appending \(k + 1\), the list `nums` now includes this new value.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `nums` list and retains the initial conditions for `n`, `k`, and `idx`.
