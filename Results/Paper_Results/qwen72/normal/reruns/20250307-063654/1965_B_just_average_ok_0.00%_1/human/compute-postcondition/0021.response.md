Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 0, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

The value of `idx` has been reset to 0. The other variables remain unchanged: `k` is still an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is still a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), `_` is still incremented by 1, and `n` is still an input integer.
