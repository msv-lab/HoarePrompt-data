The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 1 and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << 1`, which is 2. Therefore, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers, `idx` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2**
