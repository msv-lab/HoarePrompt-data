### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program initializes `nums` with powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), which is a good starting point because these elements can form any sum up to \( 2^{24} - 1 \).
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) and stores its index in `idx`.
   - It appends three new elements to `nums`:
     - \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \)
     - \( k + 1 \)
     - \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \)
   - It removes the element \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) from `nums`.

3. **No Subsequence Sums to \( k \)**:
   - By removing \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) and adding \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \), the program ensures that \( k \) cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence. This is because \( k \) is now represented as \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} + 2^{\text{idx}} \), but \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) is removed from the list.
   - The new elements \( k + 1 \) and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \) are added to ensure that the sequence can still form sums up to \( n \) without including \( k \).

4. **All Other Sums \( v \) (where \( 1 \le v \le n \) and \( v \ne k \))**:
   - The initial list `nums` contains powers of 2, which can form any sum up to \( 2^{24} - 1 \).
   - By removing \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) and adding \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \), the program ensures that all sums \( v \) (where \( 1 \le v \le n \) and \( v \ne k \)) can still be formed using the remaining elements.

5. **Size Constraint**:
   - The sequence `nums` is initially of size 24.
   - After removing one element and adding three new elements, the size of `nums` becomes 26, which exceeds the allowed limit of 25. This is a critical issue that invalidates the program.

### Example Verification:
- For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 1 (since \( 2^1 = 2 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 3, 4] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form 1 but not 2, but the size is 26, which is incorrect.

- For \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 1 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 0 (since \( 2^0 = 1 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 2, 3] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 6 except 1, but the size is 26, which is incorrect.

- For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 8 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 3 (since \( 2^3 = 8 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 2, 4, 16, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 9, 17] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 8 except 8, but the size is 26, which is incorrect.

- For \( n = 9 \) and \( k = 3 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 1 (since \( 2^1 = 2 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}, 1, 4, 5] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 9 except 3, but the size is 26, which is incorrect.

- For \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 7 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 2 (since \( 2^2 = 4 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 2, 8, 16, \ldots, 2^{23}, 3, 8, 12] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 10 except 7, but the size is 26, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that avoids forming a subsequence sum of \( k \) and can form all other sums \( v \) (where \( 1 \le v \le n \) and \( v \ne k \)). However, the size of the sequence exceeds the allowed limit of 25, which is a violation of the problem constraints.

Final: **False**
