Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers, `idx` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `_` must be less than `int(input())` for the loop to execute again.**

The value of `idx` is now 0. The list `nums` remains a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). The values of `n` and `k` are still the integers that were input. The variable `_` is incremented by 1, and it must still be less than the integer input for the loop to execute again.
