You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `n` and `k` within specified constraints. For each test case, the function generates a modified list `nums` that initially contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). It then updates this list by removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) (where `idx` is the largest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\)), and adding the values \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\). The function prints the length of the updated `nums` list and the elements of the list. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the sequence `nums` is flawed. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Construction of `nums`**:
   - The program initializes `nums` as a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).
   - It then tries to adjust `nums` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence.

2. **Flaw in the Logic**:
   - The program removes \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums` and adds `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - This approach does not guarantee that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence of `nums`.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input `n = 8` and `k = 8`.
   - The program initializes `nums` as `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304]`.
   - It then finds `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\), which is `3` (since \(2^3 = 8\)).
   - It removes `8` from `nums` and adds `k - nums[idx] = 0`, `k + 1 = 9`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1 = 17` to `nums`.
   - The resulting `nums` is `[1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 0, 9, 17]`.

4. **Issue**:
   - The sequence `nums` now includes `0`, which is not a valid non-negative integer in the context of forming sums.
   - Additionally, the sequence does not ensure that all values from 1 to 7 (excluding 8) can be formed by some subsequence. For example, the value `7` cannot be formed by any subsequence of the resulting `nums`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
