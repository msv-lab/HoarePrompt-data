Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}+1}\) is greater than `k`, `_` is incremented by 1, `_` must be less than `int(input())` for the loop to execute again.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]` generates a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) and assigns it to the variable `nums`.
- The initial state mentions that `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `1 << idx` removed, and with `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended. However, the provided code snippet overwrites `nums` with a new list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
- The values of `n`, `k`, `idx`, and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- The condition for the loop to execute again (`_` must be less than `int(input())`) remains valid.
