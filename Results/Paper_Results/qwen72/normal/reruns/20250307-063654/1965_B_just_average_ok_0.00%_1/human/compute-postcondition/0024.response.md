The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`. The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `k >= 1 << idx` holds true for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `idx` will be 2. We need to check if `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << 2` (which is 4).

Given that `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time. If `k` is less than 4, the loop will not execute again.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is at least 4 for the next iteration.

State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 4, `idx` is 1, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer**
