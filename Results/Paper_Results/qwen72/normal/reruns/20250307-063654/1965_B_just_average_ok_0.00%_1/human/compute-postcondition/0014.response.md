Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1, `nums` has a new element appended, which is equal to `k + nums[idx] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `nums`. This new element is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The values of `k` and `idx` remain unchanged, and the condition for `idx` being the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1 is still valid. The new element in `nums` is the result of adding `k`, the value at `nums[idx]`, and 1.
