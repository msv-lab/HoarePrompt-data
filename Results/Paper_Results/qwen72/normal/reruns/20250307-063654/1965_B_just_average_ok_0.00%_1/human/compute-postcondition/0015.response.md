Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1, `nums` has the element \( 1 \left\langle\left\langle \text{idx} \right\rangle\right\rangle \) removed, and a new element equal to `k + nums[idx] + 1` has been appended.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` remains unchanged.
- The value of `idx` remains unchanged.
- The element \( 1 \left\langle\left\langle \text{idx} \right\rangle\right\rangle \) (which is \( 2^{\text{idx}} \)) is removed from the list `nums`.
- The new element `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended to the list `nums`.
