You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1

        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: The loop has executed for all test cases. For each test case, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), followed by the values \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\). The length of `nums` is printed, followed by the elements of `nums`. The variables `_`, `n`, and `k` have been updated for each test case, and `idx` has been recalculated for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the sequence `nums` is flawed. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Construction of `nums`**:
   - The program initializes `nums` as a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).
   - It then tries to adjust `nums` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence.

2. **Flaw in the Logic**:
   - The program removes \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums` and adds `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - This approach does not guarantee that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence of `nums`.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input `n = 8` and `k = 8`.
   - The program initializes `nums` as `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304]`.
   - It then finds `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\), which is `3` (since \(2^3 = 8\)).
   - It removes `8` from `nums` and adds `k - nums[idx] = 0`, `k + 1 = 9`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1 = 17` to `nums`.
   - The resulting `nums` is `[1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 0, 9, 17]`.

4. **Issue**:
   - The sequence `nums` now includes `0`, which is not a valid non-negative integer in the context of forming sums.
   - Additionally, the sequence does not ensure that all values from 1 to 7 (excluding 8) can be formed by some subsequence. For example, the value `7` cannot be formed by any subsequence of the resulting `nums`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
