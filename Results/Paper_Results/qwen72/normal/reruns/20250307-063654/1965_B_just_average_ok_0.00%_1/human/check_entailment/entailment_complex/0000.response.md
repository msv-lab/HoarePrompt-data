### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The function initializes `nums` as a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). This ensures that `nums` contains 24 elements, which is within the limit of 25 elements.

2. **Finding `idx`**:
   - The function finds the largest index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\). This is done using a while loop that increments `idx` until \(2^{\text{idx}}\) exceeds `k`, then decrements `idx` by 1.

3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - The function removes \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums`.
   - It then appends three new elements to `nums`: \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\).

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the modified `nums` list.
   - It then prints the elements of the modified `nums` list.

### Verification of Conditions:

1. **No subsequence with sum `k`**:
   - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\), the function ensures that no subsequence of `nums` can sum to `k`. This is because the removed element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is crucial in forming the sum `k` with other elements in the list.

2. **Subsequences for all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\)**:
   - The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2, which can form any sum up to \(2^{24} - 1\) (which is much larger than \(10^6\)).
   - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding the new elements, the function ensures that all sums \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\) can still be formed. The new elements \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) help in covering the gaps created by removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\).

### Edge Cases:

- **Test Case: \(n = 2\), \(k = 2\)**:
  - The function initializes `nums` as \([1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}]\).
  - `idx` is 1 (since \(2^1 = 2\)).
  - The function removes \(2^1 = 2\) and appends \(2 - 2 = 0\), \(2 + 1 = 3\), and \(2 + 2 + 1 = 5\).
  - The final `nums` is \([1, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 3, 5]\).
  - The length of `nums` is 24, and the elements are printed.

- **Test Case: \(n = 6\), \(k = 1\)**:
  - The function initializes `nums` as \([1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}]\).
  - `idx` is 0 (since \(2^0 = 1\)).
  - The function removes \(2^0 = 1\) and appends \(1 - 1 = 0\), \(1 + 1 = 2\), and \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\).
  - The final `nums` is \([2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 2, 3]\).
  - The length of `nums` is 24, and the elements are printed.

- **Test Case: \(n = 8\), \(k = 8\)**:
  - The function initializes `nums` as \([1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}]\).
  - `idx` is 3 (since \(2^3 = 8\)).
  - The function removes \(2^3 = 8\) and appends \(8 - 8 = 0\), \(8 + 1 = 9\), and \(8 + 8 + 1 = 17\).
  - The final `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 16, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 9, 17]\).
  - The length of `nums` is 24, and the elements are printed.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly generates a sequence `nums` that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\) can be formed.
