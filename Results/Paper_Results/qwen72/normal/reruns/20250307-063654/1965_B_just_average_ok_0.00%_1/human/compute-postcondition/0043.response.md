Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers, `idx` is 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.** 

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so `idx` is now 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
