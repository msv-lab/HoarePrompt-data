### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The program initializes `nums` as a list of the first 24 powers of 2, i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^23]`. This ensures that `nums` can represent any sum up to \(2^{24} - 1\) (which is much larger than the maximum value of \(n\)).

2. **Finding the Index**:
   - The program then finds the largest index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \le k\). This is done using a while loop that increments `idx` until \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\), and then decrements `idx` by 1.

3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - The program removes \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums` to ensure that no subsequence of `nums` can sum to \(k\).
   - It then appends three new elements to `nums`:
     - \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\): This ensures that \(k\) cannot be formed by any subsequence of `nums` because \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is not in `nums`.
     - \(k + 1\): This ensures that \(k + 1\) can be formed by a subsequence of `nums`.
     - \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\): This ensures that \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) can be formed by a subsequence of `nums`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums` for each test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Condition 1: No subsequence of `nums` should sum to \(k\)**:
  - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums`, the program ensures that \(k\) cannot be formed by any subsequence. This is because \(k\) is the sum of \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and some other elements, and without \(2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k\) cannot be formed.

- **Condition 2: For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there should be a subsequence of `nums` that sums to \(v\)**:
  - The remaining elements in `nums` are powers of 2, which can represent any sum up to \(2^{24} - 1\) (much larger than \(n\)).
  - The elements \(k + 1\) and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) are added to ensure that sums greater than \(k\) can be formed.
  - The element \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\) is added to ensure that sums less than \(k\) can be formed, but not \(k\) itself.

### Edge Cases:

- **When \(k\) is a power of 2**:
  - If \(k\) is a power of 2, say \(k = 2^{\text{idx}}\), the program will remove \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and add \(k - 2^{\text{idx}} = 0\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\). This ensures that \(k\) cannot be formed, and all other sums \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\) can be formed.

- **When \(k\) is not a power of 2**:
  - The program will remove the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) and add the necessary elements to ensure that all sums \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\) can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and ensures that no subsequence of `nums` sums to \(k\) while allowing all other sums \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\) to be formed. The size of `nums` is also within the allowed limit of 25.

### Correctness:
**True**
