To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `k >= 1 << idx`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`.

2. **Initial State of Variables:**
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `idx` is 0.

3. **Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `k >= 1 << idx`.
   - When `idx` is 0, `1 << idx` is `1 << 0`, which is `1`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - The condition `k >= 1` must be true for the loop to execute the first time.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `k` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `idx` is already 0, which is the correct initial value for the loop to check the condition.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes the first time, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `nums` is a list of 24 integers where each element is a power of 2 (starting from 2^0 to 2^23), `idx` is 0, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1**
