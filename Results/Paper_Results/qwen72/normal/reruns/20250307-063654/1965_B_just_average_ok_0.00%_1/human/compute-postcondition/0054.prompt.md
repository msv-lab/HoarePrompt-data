Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
    idx = 0
    while k >= 1 << idx:
        idx += 1
    idx -= 1
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1, `nums` has the element \( 1 \left\langle\left\langle \text{idx} \right\rangle\right\rangle \) removed, and a new element equal to `k + nums[idx] + 1` has been appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{idx}+1} \) is greater than `k`, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \) with `1 << idx` removed, and with `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), followed by the value \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + nums[\text{idx}] + 1\); `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers; `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) minus 1; `k` must be a non-negative integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
