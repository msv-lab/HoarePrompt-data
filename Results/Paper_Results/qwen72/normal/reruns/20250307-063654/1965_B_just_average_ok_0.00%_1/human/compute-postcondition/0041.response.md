Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers, `idx` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.** 

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
