Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{idx}+1} \) is greater than `k`, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, `k + 1` appended, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`. The previous state of `nums` included powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), followed by `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`. After the code execution, `nums` now includes the additional element `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The values of `k`, `idx`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `_` is incremented by 1.
