The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers, `n` and `k`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. The function also accepts the number of test cases, `t`, as an integer where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^7`.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^7`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
