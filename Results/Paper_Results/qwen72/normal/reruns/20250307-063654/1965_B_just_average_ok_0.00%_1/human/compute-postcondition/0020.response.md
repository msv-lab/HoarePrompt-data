Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]` reassigns `nums` to a new list containing the powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \).
- The initial state information about `k`, `idx`, `n`, and `_` remains unchanged.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified, so we only note that it has been incremented.
- The initial state information about `nums` being modified by removing an element and appending a new one is no longer valid after the code execution, as `nums` is now a new list of powers of 2.
