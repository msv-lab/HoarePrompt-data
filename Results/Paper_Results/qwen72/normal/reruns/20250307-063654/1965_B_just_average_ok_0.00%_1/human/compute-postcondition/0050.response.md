Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) followed by the value \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + nums[\text{idx}] + 1\); `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers; `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) minus 1; `k` must be a non-negative integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)` adds a new element to the list `nums`.
- The new element is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- `nums[idx]` is the value \(2^{\text{idx}}\) because `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) minus 1, and `nums` contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
- Therefore, the new element added to `nums` is \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\).
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
