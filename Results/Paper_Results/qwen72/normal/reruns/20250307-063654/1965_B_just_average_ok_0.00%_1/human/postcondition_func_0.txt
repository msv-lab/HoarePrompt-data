The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `n` and `k` within specified constraints. For each test case, the function generates a modified list `nums` that initially contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). It then updates this list by removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) (where `idx` is the largest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\)), and adding the values \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\). The function prints the length of the updated `nums` list and the elements of the list. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case.
