Output State: **The loop has executed for all test cases. For each test case, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), followed by the values \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\). The length of `nums` is printed, followed by the elements of `nums`. The variables `_`, `n`, and `k` have been updated for each test case, and `idx` has been recalculated for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all the iterations, the function has processed each test case. For each test case, the list `nums` has been modified by removing the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `k` and appending three new elements: `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1`. The length of the modified `nums` list and its elements are printed for each test case. The loop variable `_` has been incremented for each test case, and the variables `n` and `k` have been updated with new values from the input for each test case. The variable `idx` has been recalculated for each test case to find the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\) minus 1.
