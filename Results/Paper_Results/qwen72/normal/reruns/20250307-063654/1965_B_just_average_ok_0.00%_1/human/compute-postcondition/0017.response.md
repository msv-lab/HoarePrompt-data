Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`k`**: An input integer greater than or equal to 1.
2. **`idx`**: The smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1 \).
3. **`nums`**: A list that initially contains the element \( 1 \left\langle\left\langle \text{idx} \right\rangle\right\rangle \) (which is \( 2^{\text{idx}} \)) and then has this element removed. A new element equal to `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended to the list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `idx`**:
   - `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1 \).
   - For example, if \( k = 1 \), then \( 1 < 2^1 - 1 \) is false, but \( 1 < 2^2 - 1 \) is true, so `idx` would be 2.
   - If \( k = 3 \), then \( 3 < 2^2 - 1 \) is false, but \( 3 < 2^3 - 1 \) is true, so `idx` would be 3.

2. **Determine the initial element in `nums`**:
   - The initial element in `nums` is \( 2^{\text{idx}} \).

3. **Remove the initial element from `nums`**:
   - The element \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) is removed from `nums`.

4. **Append a new element to `nums`**:
   - The new element appended is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - Since `nums[idx]` is the element that was just removed, it is \( 2^{\text{idx}} \).
   - Therefore, the new element is \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \).

5. **Final state of `nums`**:
   - `nums` will contain the new element \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \).

### Example Calculation:
- Let's say \( k = 3 \).
- The smallest `idx` such that \( 3 < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1 \) is 3.
- The initial element in `nums` is \( 2^3 = 8 \).
- This element is removed from `nums`.
- The new element appended is \( 3 + 8 + 1 = 12 \).
- Therefore, `nums` will be `[12]`.

### General Case:
- For any given \( k \), the smallest `idx` such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} - 1 \) will be determined.
- The initial element in `nums` will be \( 2^{\text{idx}} \).
- This element is removed from `nums`.
- The new element appended is \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \).
- Therefore, `nums` will be `[k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1]`.

### Output:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print the single element in the list `nums`, which is \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \).

Output: **k + 2^idx + 1 (where k is the input integer and idx is the smallest integer such that k < 2^idx - 1)**
