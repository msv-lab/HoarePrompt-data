Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1, `nums` has the element \( 1 \left\langle\left\langle \text{idx} \right\rangle\right\rangle \) removed, and a new element equal to `k + nums[idx] + 1` has been appended, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- `k` remains an input integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `idx` remains the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.
- `nums` still has the element \( 1 \left\langle\left\langle \text{idx} \right\rangle\right\rangle \) removed and a new element equal to `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended.
- `_` is still incremented by 1.
- `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, and `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input.
