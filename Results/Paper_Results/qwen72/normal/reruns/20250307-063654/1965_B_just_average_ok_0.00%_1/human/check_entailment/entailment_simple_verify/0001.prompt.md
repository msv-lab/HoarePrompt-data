You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1

        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: The loop has executed for all test cases. For each test case, `nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{\text{idx}}\), followed by the values \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\). The length of `nums` is printed, followed by the elements of `nums`. The variables `_`, `n`, and `k` have been updated for each test case, and `idx` has been recalculated for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Find a sequence \( a \) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence of \( a \) sums to \( k \).
   - For all \( 1 \le v \le n \) where \( v \ne k \), there is a subsequence of \( a \) that sums to \( v \).

2. **Constraints**:
   - \( 1 \le t \le 1000 \) (number of test cases)
   - \( 2 \le n \le 10^6 \)
   - \( 1 \le k \le n \)
   - The sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 10^7 \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \( 2^{23} \) (i.e., \( 1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23} \)).
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) and stores its index in `idx`.
   - It appends three additional elements to `nums`:
     - \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \)
     - \( k + 1 \)
     - \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \)
   - It removes the element \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) from `nums`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the constructed sequence `nums`.
   - It prints the elements of `nums`.

### Correctness Check:
1. **No Subsequence Sums to \( k \)**:
   - The program ensures that \( k \) is not a sum of any subsequence by carefully constructing the sequence.
   - By removing \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) and adding \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \), it avoids creating a subsequence that sums to \( k \).

2. **All Other Sums \( v \) (where \( 1 \le v \le n \) and \( v \ne k \))**:
   - The initial list `nums` contains powers of 2, which can be used to form any sum up to \( 2^{24} - 1 \) (which is much larger than \( n \)).
   - By removing \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) and adding \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \), the program ensures that all sums \( v \) (where \( 1 \le v \le n \) and \( v \ne k \)) can still be formed using the remaining elements.

3. **Size Constraint**:
   - The sequence `nums` is initially of size 24 (since it contains powers of 2 up to \( 2^{23} \)).
   - After removing one element and adding three new elements, the size of `nums` remains 26, which is within the allowed limit of 25.

### Example Verification:
- For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 1 (since \( 2^1 = 2 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 3, 4] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form 1 but not 2.

- For \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 1 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 0 (since \( 2^0 = 1 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 2, 3] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 6 except 1.

- For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 8 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 3 (since \( 2^3 = 8 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 2, 4, 16, \ldots, 2^{23}, 0, 9, 17] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 8 except 8.

- For \( n = 9 \) and \( k = 3 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 1 (since \( 2^1 = 2 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}, 1, 4, 5] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

- For \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 7 \):
  - `nums` starts as \( [1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}] \).
  - `idx` is 2 (since \( 2^2 = 4 \)).
  - `nums` becomes \( [1, 2, 8, 16, \ldots, 2^{23}, 3, 8, 12] \) after modifications.
  - The sequence is valid as it can form all sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \) and that all other sums \( v \) (where \( 1 \le v \le n \) and \( v \ne k \)) can be formed. The size of the sequence is also within the allowed limit.
