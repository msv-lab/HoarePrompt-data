Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\), `k` must be a non-negative integer.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
- Each time the loop runs, `idx` is incremented by 1.
- The loop will stop when `k` is less than \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
- Therefore, after all iterations, `idx` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\).
- The values of `nums`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
