Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`k`**: An input integer greater than or equal to 1.
2. **`idx`**: The smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{idx}+1} \) is greater than `k`.
3. **`nums`**: A list of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \) with \( 1 << \text{idx} \) (which is \( 2^{\text{idx}} \)) removed, and with `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended.
4. **`_`**: Incremented by 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
5. **`n`**: An input integer (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `idx`**:
   - `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{idx}+1} \) is greater than `k`.
   - This means \( 2^{\text{idx}} \leq k < 2^{\text{idx}+1} \).

2. **Construct the `nums` list**:
   - The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \).
   - The element \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) is removed from the list.
   - The elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are appended to the list.

3. **Calculate the length of `nums`**:
   - The initial length of `nums` is 24 (since it contains \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{23} \)).
   - One element \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) is removed, reducing the length by 1.
   - Three elements are appended, increasing the length by 3.
   - Therefore, the final length of `nums` is \( 24 - 1 + 3 = 26 \).

### Final Output:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the `nums` list, which is 26.

Output: **26**
