The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, and `idx` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << 3` (which is 8) when `idx` is incremented to 3.

State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 8, `idx` is 3**
