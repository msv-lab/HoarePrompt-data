Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1, `nums` has a new element appended, which is equal to `k + 1`.** 

The value of `k` remains the same, and `idx` is still the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1. The list `nums` has a new element appended, which is `k + 1`.
