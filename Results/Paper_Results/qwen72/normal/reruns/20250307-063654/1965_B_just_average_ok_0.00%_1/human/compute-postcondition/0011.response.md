Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1.**

In natural language: The value of `idx` is decreased by 1, so it is now the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \) minus 1. The value of `k` remains the same, as an input integer greater than or equal to 1.
