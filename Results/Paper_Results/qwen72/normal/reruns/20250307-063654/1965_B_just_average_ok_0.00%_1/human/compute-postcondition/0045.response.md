Output State: **`nums` is a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers, `idx` is 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 8.**

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The values of `nums`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `k` must still be greater than or equal to 8.
