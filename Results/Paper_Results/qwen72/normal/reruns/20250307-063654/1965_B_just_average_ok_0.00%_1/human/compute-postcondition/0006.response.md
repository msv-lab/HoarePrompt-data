The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, and `idx` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << 1`, which is 2. Therefore, `k` must be at least 2 for the next iteration to proceed. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `idx` is 1**
