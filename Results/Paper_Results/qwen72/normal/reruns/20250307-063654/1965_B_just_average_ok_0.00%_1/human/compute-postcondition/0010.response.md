Output State: **`k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \).**

### Explanation:
The loop continues to increment `idx` by 1 as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \( 2^{\text{idx}} \). This means that the loop will stop when `idx` becomes the smallest integer for which \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \). 

- Initially, `idx` is 0.
- After the first iteration, `idx` becomes 1, and the loop condition checks if \( k \geq 2^1 \).
- After the second iteration, `idx` becomes 2, and the loop condition checks if \( k \geq 2^2 \).
- After the third iteration, `idx` becomes 4, and the loop condition checks if \( k \geq 2^4 \).

This pattern continues until `idx` is the smallest integer such that \( k < 2^{\text{idx}} \). At this point, the loop condition `k >= 1 << idx` will be false, and the loop will terminate.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
