The only object in the loop head is the range object created by `range(int(sys.stdin.readline()))`. The loop will execute again if the value returned by `int(sys.stdin.readline())` is greater than 1. Since the loop head does not directly modify any variables, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that the condition for the loop to execute again is met.

State: **The function `solve()` has been called, and the loop will execute again if `int(sys.stdin.readline())` is greater than 1. The initial state remains unchanged.**
