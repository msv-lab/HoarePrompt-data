The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is used as a throwaway variable to iterate a specific number of times. The number of iterations is determined by the value returned by `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that the `solve()` function has been called, we can infer that one iteration has completed. However, the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())` is not directly stored in a variable, so we cannot directly modify or reference it.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- The loop will execute again if there are more iterations left, which means the number of iterations specified by `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed.
- Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its specific value is not important, but we know that it will be incremented internally by the loop mechanism.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop has one less iteration remaining compared to the initial state.

State: **The initial state remains unchanged, but the function `solve()` has been called, and the loop will execute again if `int(sys.stdin.readline())` is greater than 1.**
