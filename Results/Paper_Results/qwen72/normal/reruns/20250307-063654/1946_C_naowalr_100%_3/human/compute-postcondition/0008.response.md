Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input and calls the `solve` function that many times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `solve` function has been executed the number of times specified by the input integer, and the initial state of the program remains unchanged. **
