To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `_` and the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`.

1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.
2. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

Given that the state before the loop starts is "None of the variables in the function signature are used," we need to ensure that the input read by `sys.stdin.readline()` is a positive integer.

State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0**
