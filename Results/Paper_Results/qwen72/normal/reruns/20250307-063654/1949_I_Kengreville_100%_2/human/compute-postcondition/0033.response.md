Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with integer values from corresponding inputs, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False` except `visited[0]` and `visited[1]` which are `True` if `i` (which is 1) was not visited, `coef` is a list where `coef[1]` is 1 and `coef[2]` is now 1, `tot` might be updated, `bipartite` might be set to `False`, and `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0.**
