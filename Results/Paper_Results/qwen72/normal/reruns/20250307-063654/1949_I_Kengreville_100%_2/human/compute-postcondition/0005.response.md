Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`.**

The code snippet `coef = [None] * n` reinitializes the `coef` list to a list of `None` values of length `n`. Since the initial state already specifies that `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`, the state of `coef` remains unchanged. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`) are not affected by this code snippet.
