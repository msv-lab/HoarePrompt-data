Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with integer values from corresponding inputs, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False` except `visited[0]` which is `True`. If `i` (which is 1) is not visited, then `visited[1]` is set to `True`, `coef[1]` is set to 1, `tot` might be updated, `bipartite` might be set to `False`, and `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0. Otherwise, the state of `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` remains unchanged.***
