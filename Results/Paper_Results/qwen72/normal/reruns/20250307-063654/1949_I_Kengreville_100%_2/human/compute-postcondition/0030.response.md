Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with integer values from corresponding inputs, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False` except `visited[0]` and `visited[1]` which are `True`, `coef` is a list of length `n` where `coef[0]` is 1 and `coef[1]` is 1, the rest are `None`, `tot` might be updated, `bipartite` might be set to `False`, `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**
