Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element at index `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) is assigned the integer values from the corresponding input, `visited` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `None`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element at index `i` (0 ≤ `i` < `n`) is assigned the integer values from the corresponding input, `visited` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` where `coef[0]` is 1 and the rest are `None`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`. If `visited[0]` is `False`, the element at index `0` in the `visited` list is set to `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with integer values from corresponding inputs, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False` except `visited[0]` which is `True`. If `i` (which is 1) is not visited, then `visited[1]` is set to `True`, `coef[1]` is set to 1, `tot` might be updated, `bipartite` might be set to `False`, and `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0. Otherwise, the state of `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with integer values from corresponding inputs, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False` except `visited[0]` and `visited[1]` which are `True`. If `i` (which is 2) was not visited, `visited[2]` is set to `True`, `coef[1]` is set to 1, `coef[2]` is set to 1, `tot` is 1, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `True`. Otherwise, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` retain their initial values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
