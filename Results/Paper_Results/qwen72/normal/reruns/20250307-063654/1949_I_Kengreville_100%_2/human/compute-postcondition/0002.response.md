Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n, `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n`, initialized to False and None respectively.**

The code snippet `y = [None] * n` reassigns the list `y` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
