Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` and `r` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, where -10^9 <= y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n`, initialized to False and None respectively.**
