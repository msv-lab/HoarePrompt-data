Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`.**

The code `visited = [False] * n` reinitializes the `visited` list to a list of `False` values of length `n`. Since `visited` was already a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, the state of `visited` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `coef`) are not affected by this code snippet.
