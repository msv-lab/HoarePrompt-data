Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with integer values from corresponding inputs.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`.
- `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) is 1 if `visited[i]` was `False` before the loop.
- `tot` is the number of times `dfs(i)` was called with `i` where `visited[i]` was `False` before the loop.
- `bipartite` is `True` if all calls to `dfs(i)` kept it `True`.
- `ok` is `False` (either `bipartite` is `False` or `tot` is 0).

### Analysis:
1. **`visited` List**: All elements in the `visited` list are `True`.
2. **`coef` List**: Since all elements in `visited` are `True`, no element in `coef` will be 1. Therefore, all elements in `coef` will be 0.
3. **`tot` Variable**: The number of times `dfs(i)` was called with `i` where `visited[i]` was `False` before the loop is 0, because no element in `visited` is `False`.
4. **`bipartite` Variable**: The value of `bipartite` is not explicitly given, but it does not affect the final output because `tot` is 0.
5. **`ok` Variable**: `ok` is `False` if either `bipartite` is `False` or `tot` is 0. Since `tot` is 0, `ok` will always be `False`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.
- The variables and conditions described in the initial state do not influence the output of this specific print statement, as it is a constant string.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
