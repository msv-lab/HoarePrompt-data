The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]` are assigned the integer values from the input. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]` are assigned the integer values from the input.**
