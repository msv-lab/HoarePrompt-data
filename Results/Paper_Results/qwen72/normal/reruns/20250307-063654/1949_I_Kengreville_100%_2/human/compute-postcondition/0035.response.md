Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with integer values from corresponding inputs, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False` except `visited[0]` and `visited[1]` which are `True`, `coef` is a list where `coef[1]` is 1 and `coef[2]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `True` if `tot` is not 0.**

The value of `bipartite` is now set to `True`. The state of `ok` is determined by the value of `tot`, which remains 0, so `ok` is still `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
