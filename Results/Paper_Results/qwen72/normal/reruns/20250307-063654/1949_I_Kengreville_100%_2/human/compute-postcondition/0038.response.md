Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with integer values from corresponding inputs, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False` except `visited[0]` and `visited[1]` which are `True`. If `i` (which is 2) was not visited, `visited[2]` is set to `True`, `coef[1]` is set to 1, `coef[2]` is set to 1, `tot` is 1, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `True`. Otherwise, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, `bipartite`, and `ok` retain their initial values.***
