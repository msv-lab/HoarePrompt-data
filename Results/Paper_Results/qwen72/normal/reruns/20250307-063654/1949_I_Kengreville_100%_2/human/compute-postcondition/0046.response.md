Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and three lists `x`, `y`, and `r` of integers, each of length `n`. It then processes these lists using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to determine if a certain condition (bipartite and non-zero total) is met. If the condition is satisfied, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function concludes, `n` remains greater than 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` retain their input values, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`, and `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `i` is 1 if `visited[i]` was `False` before the loop, and `tot` is the number of times `dfs(i)` was called with `i` where `visited[i]` was `False` before the loop. The final state of `bipartite` and `ok` depends on the DFS results. **
