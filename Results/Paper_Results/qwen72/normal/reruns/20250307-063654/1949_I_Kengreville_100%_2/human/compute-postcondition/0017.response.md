Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element at index `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) is assigned the integer values from the corresponding input, `visited` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `None`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`, and the element at index `i` in the `visited` list is `False`.**
