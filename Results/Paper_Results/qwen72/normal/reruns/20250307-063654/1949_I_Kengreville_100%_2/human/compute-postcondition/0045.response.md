The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, where -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. Additionally, `visited` and `coef` are lists of length `n`, initialized to `False` and `None` respectively. The function returns a specific output based on these constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates on predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`, each of length `n` (1 <= n <= 1000), and returns a result based on the values in these lists.**
