Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None.**

The code `r = [None] * n` reassigns `r` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`. The previous state of `r` (which was a list of integers) is overwritten. The other variables remain unchanged.
