Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with integer values from corresponding inputs.
   - `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`.
   - `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) is 1 if `visited[i]` was `False` before the loop.
   - `tot` is the number of times `dfs(i)` was called with `i` where `visited[i]` was `False` before the loop.
   - `bipartite` is `True` if all calls to `dfs(i)` kept it `True`.
   - `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0.
   - Additionally, `ok` is `True` and thus `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The initial state explicitly states that `ok` is `True`.
   - The condition for `ok` being `True` is that `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0.
   - Since `ok` is `True`, it implies that both `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0.
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
