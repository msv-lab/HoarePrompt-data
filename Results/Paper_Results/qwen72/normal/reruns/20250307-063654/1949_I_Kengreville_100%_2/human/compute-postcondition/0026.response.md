Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element at index `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) is assigned the integer values from the corresponding input, `visited` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `False` except `visited[0]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of length `n` where `coef[0]` is 1 and `coef[1]` is 1, the rest are `None`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**

The code snippet `tot = 0` reassigns the variable `tot` to 0, but since `tot` was already 0 in the initial state, no change occurs. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
