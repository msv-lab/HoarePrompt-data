Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` with integer values from corresponding inputs, `visited` is a list of length `n` where all elements are `True`, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) is 1 if `visited[i]` was `False` before the loop, `tot` is the number of times `dfs(i)` was called with `i` where `visited[i]` was `False` before the loop, `bipartite` is `True` if all calls to `dfs(i)` kept it `True`, and `ok` is `False` (either `bipartite` is `False` or `tot` is 0).**
