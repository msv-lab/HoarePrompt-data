The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element at index `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) is assigned the integer values from the corresponding input, `visited` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `False` except `visited[0]` which is `True`, `coef` is a list of length `n` where `coef[0]` is 1 and the rest are `None`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.**
