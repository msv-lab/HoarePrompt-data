Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element at index `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `n`) is assigned the integer values from the corresponding input. `visited` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `None`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`.** 

The variable `bipartite` is set to `True`, and all other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
