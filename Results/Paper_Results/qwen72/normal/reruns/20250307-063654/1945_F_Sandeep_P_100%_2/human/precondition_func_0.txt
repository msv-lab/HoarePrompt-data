The provided function `func_1` does not seem to be directly related to the problem of helping Kirill gather mushrooms to brew an elixir. The function appears to be a decorator that modifies the behavior of a `repr` function to return a specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls. This is not a typical part of the solution for the given problem and does not contain the variables that would be relevant to the task.

However, if we were to extract a precondition based on the function signature and the context of the problem, we would need to clarify the purpose of this function in the solution. Since the function does not use any of the variables from the problem (such as `n`, `v`, or `p`), and it is not clear how it contributes to the solution, it is difficult to provide a meaningful precondition.

If you intended to provide a different function that is part of the solution, please provide the correct function, and I will be able to extract the precondition for you.
