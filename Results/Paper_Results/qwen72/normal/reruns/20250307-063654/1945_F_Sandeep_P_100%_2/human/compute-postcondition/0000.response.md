The provided code snippet is a docstring for a decorator function and does not contain any executable code that would change the state of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The provided function `func_1` does not seem to be directly related to the problem of helping Kirill gather mushrooms to brew an elixir. The function appears to be a decorator that modifies the behavior of a `repr` function to return a specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls. This is not a typical part of the solution for the given problem and does not contain the variables that would be relevant to the task.**
