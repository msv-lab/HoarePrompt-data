You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The provided function `func_1` does not seem to be directly related to the problem of helping Kirill gather mushrooms to brew an elixir. The function appears to be a decorator that modifies the behavior of a `repr` function to return a specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls. This is not a typical part of the solution for the given problem and does not contain the variables that would be relevant to the task.

However, if we were to extract a precondition based on the function signature and the context of the problem, we would need to clarify the purpose of this function in the solution. Since the function does not use any of the variables from the problem (such as `n`, `v`, or `p`), and it is not clear how it contributes to the solution, it is difficult to provide a meaningful precondition.

If you intended to provide a different function that is part of the solution, please provide the correct function, and I will be able to extract the precondition for you.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the `decorating_function`, which is a function designed to modify the behavior of a `repr` function to return a specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns a `decorating_function` that modifies the behavior of a `repr` function to return the specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the `decorating_function`, which is a function designed to modify the behavior of a `repr` function to return a specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
