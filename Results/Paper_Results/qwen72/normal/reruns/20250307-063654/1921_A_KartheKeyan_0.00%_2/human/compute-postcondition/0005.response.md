The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the integer value `4` in the `range(4)` function. The loop will execute 4 times regardless of the values of `n`, `s`, `coord`, and `res` because the range function is defined to iterate from 0 to 3 (4 times in total). However, for the loop to start, `i` should be at the beginning of its range, which is 0.

Given that the loop will execute a fixed number of times (4), there is no need to adjust `n`, `s`, `coord`, or `res` to ensure the loop executes. The only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `i` is set to 0, which is the default starting point for the `range(4)` function.

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
