Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the new input integers.**

The `coord` list is now sorted based on the tuples it contains, while all other variables remain unchanged.
