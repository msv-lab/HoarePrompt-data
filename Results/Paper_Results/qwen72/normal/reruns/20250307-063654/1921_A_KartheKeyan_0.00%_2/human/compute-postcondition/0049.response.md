The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in an empty list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in an empty list, `res` is 0**
