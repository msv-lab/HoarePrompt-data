The function `func` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads 4 pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then calculates and prints the area of the square formed by these coordinates. The function does not return any value but prints the area for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `n` set to 0.
