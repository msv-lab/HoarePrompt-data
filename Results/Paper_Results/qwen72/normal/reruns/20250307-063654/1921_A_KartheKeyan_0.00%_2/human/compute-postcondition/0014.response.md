Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the new input integers.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all 4 iterations:
- The variable `n` remains an input integer and must be non-zero.
- The variable `s` is still the last calculated value based on the input `l`.
- The list `coord` now contains 4 tuples, each representing a pair of integers `(x, y)` that were input during each iteration.
- The variable `res` remains 0.
- The variable `i` is 3, indicating that the loop has completed 4 iterations (since `i` starts at 0 and increments to 3).
- The variables `x` and `y` are updated to the values of the last input pair of integers.
