Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, and the value of `s` has been printed for each iteration of the loop. The function `func` and the test cases remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while n:
    coord = []
    res = 0
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
    p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
    res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))
    print(res)
    n -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer minus 1, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the new input integers, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points in `coord`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is now a sorted list of four tuples, each representing a pair of input integers, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 4, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` was initially greater than 0), `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a list containing 4 tuples, each tuple representing a pair of input integers, but now sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the sorted list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the sorted list, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
