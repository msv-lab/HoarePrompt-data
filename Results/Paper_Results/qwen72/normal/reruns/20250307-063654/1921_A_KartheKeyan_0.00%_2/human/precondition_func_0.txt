The function `func` should take a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a list of 4 tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The integers x_i and y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each test case is guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.
