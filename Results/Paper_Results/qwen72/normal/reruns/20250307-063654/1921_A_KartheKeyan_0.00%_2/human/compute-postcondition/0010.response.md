The code `coord.append((x, y))` adds the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `res`, `i`) are not affected by this code. Since `x` and `y` are input integers, the new tuple `(x, y)` is appended to `coord`, which initially contains one tuple `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are input integers.**
