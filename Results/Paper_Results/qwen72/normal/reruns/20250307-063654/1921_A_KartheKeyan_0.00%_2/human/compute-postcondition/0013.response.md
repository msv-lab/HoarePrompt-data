Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and the new tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to the new input integers.**

The new tuple `(x, y)` is appended to the list `coord`, making it a list with three tuples. The values of `n`, `s`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` are updated to the new input integers.
