Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are input integers.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `coord`, `res`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `x` and `y` as input integers, while the rest of the initial state remains valid.
