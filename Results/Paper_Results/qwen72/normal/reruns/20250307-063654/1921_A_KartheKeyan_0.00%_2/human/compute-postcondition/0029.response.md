Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` contains the tuple `(x, y)` as its last element, where `x` and `y` are the new input integers.** 

The code `coord.append((x, y))` adds the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord` as its last element. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `x` and `y` are still the new input integers.
