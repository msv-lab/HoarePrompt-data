Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` contains four tuples, each representing a pair of input integers.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs 4 times, with `i` starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 each iteration. After the loop finishes, `i` will be 3.
- In each iteration, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, and the tuple `(x, y)` is appended to the list `coord`.
- After 4 iterations, `coord` will contain 4 tuples, each representing a pair of input integers.
- The variables `n`, `s`, `p1`, and `p2` are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged from their initial state.
