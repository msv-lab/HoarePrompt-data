The only variables in the loop head are `i`. The loop's continuation depends on `i` being less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` contains the tuple `(x, y)` as its last element, where `x` and `y` are the new input integers.**
