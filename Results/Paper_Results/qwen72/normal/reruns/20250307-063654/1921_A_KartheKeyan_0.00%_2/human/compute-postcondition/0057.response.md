Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 4.
2. `n` must be greater than 0.
3. `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers.
4. `coord` is a list containing 4 tuples, each tuple representing a pair of input integers, but now sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple.
5. `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the sorted list.
6. `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the sorted list.
7. `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(res)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`coord` List**:
   - `coord` is a list of 4 tuples, each containing two integers.
   - The tuples are sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple.

2. **`p1` Calculation**:
   - `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the sorted list.
   - If the first tuple is `(x1, y1)` and the second tuple is `(x2, y2)`, then:
     \[
     p1 = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2
     \]

3. **`p2` Calculation**:
   - `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the sorted list.
   - If the third tuple is `(x3, y3)` and the fourth tuple is `(x4, y4)`, then:
     \[
     p2 = (x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2
     \]

4. **`res` Calculation**:
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     res = \left| \sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2} \right|
     \]
   - Since the square root of a non-negative number is always non-negative, the absolute value operation is redundant. Therefore:
     \[
     res = \sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2}
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     res = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \times \sqrt{(x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2}
     \]
   - Which further simplifies to:
     \[
     res = \sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2} = \sqrt{p1 \times p2}
     \]

### Final Output:
The `print(res)` statement will print the square root of the product of the squared Euclidean distances between the first and second tuples, and the third and fourth tuples in the sorted list `coord`.

Since the exact values of the tuples in `coord` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the square root of the product of the squared Euclidean distances between the first and second tuples, and the third and fourth tuples in the sorted list `coord`)**
