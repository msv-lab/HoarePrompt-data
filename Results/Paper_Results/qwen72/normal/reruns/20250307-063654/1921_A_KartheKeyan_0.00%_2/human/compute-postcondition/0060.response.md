The function `func` accepts a list of test cases. Each test case is a list of 4 tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The integers x_i and y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each test case is guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to whether the given coordinates form a valid square with the specified properties.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of 4 tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns a list of results, each indicating whether the given coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**
