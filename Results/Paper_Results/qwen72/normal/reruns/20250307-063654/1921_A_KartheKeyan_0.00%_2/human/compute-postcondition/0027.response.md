The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `4`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` and `y` are input integers, `coord` contains the tuple `(x, y)` as its last element.**
