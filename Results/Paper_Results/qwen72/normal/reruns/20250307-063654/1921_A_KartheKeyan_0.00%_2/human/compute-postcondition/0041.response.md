Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is now an empty list, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in an empty list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in an empty list, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `n` must be non-zero.**

Explanation:
- `coord` is now an empty list, as the code snippet reassigns `coord` to an empty list.
- The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, `p2`, `res`, and the condition for `n` remain unchanged, but `p1` and `p2` are now based on an empty list, which means they are undefined in the context of the empty list.
