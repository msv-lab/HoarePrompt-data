Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a list containing 4 tuples, each tuple representing a pair of input integers, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the list, `res` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all 4 iterations:
- The loop counter `i` has reached 4, indicating that the loop has completed its 4 iterations.
- The variables `x` and `y` have been updated to the latest pair of input integers.
- The list `coord` now contains 4 tuples, each representing a pair of input integers that were provided during the loop's execution.
- `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the `coord` list.
- `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the `coord` list.
- The variable `res` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
