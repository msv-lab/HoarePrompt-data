Output State: **`n` is an input integer minus 1, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the new input integers, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points in `coord`, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points in `coord`**

Explanation:
- The code `coord = []` reassigns `coord` to an empty list, overriding its previous value.
- The values of `n`, `s`, `res`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
