The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the implicit `range(4)`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute 4 times regardless of the initial value of `i`, as long as `i` starts within the range of 0 to 3. However, since the loop is defined to iterate over `range(4)`, the variable `i` should start at 0 to ensure the loop executes correctly.

State: **`i` is 0**
