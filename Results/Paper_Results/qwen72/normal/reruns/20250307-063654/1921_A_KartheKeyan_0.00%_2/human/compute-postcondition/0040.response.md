The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state of `n` is not specified, but since the loop has already executed, `n` must have been truthy at that point. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must remain truthy.

State: **`i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is now a sorted list of four tuples, each representing a pair of input integers, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `n` must be non-zero**
