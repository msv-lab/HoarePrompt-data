Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in an empty list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in an empty list, `res` is 0**

The code `coord.append((x, y))` adds the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, and the list `coord` now contains this tuple. The other variables `i`, `n`, `p1`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged.
