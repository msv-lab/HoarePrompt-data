Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is now a sorted list of four tuples, each representing a pair of input integers, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.**

The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
