You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` should take a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a list of 4 tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The integers x_i and y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each test case is guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.
def func():
    """
    n = int(input())
     
    while n :
        
        l = int(input())
        s = 0
        s += (l//4)+(l-(4*(l//4)))//2
        print(s)
        n-=1
     
            
    """
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
        
        p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
        
        res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))
        
        print(res)
        
        n -= 1
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is a list containing 4 tuples, each tuple representing a pair of input integers, but now sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the last input integers, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the sorted list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the sorted list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of 4 tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns a list of results, each indicating whether the given coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
