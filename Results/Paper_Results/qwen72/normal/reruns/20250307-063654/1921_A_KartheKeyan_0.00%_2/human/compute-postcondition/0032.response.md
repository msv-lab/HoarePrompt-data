Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` contains the tuple `(x, y)` as its last element, where `x` and `y` are the new input integers.** 

The code appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`, where `x` and `y` are the new input integers. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
