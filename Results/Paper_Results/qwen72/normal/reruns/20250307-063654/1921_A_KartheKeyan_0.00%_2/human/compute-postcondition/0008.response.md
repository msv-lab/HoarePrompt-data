The only variables in the loop head are `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to the range specified (which is 4). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and it must still be less than 4.

State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are input integers.**
