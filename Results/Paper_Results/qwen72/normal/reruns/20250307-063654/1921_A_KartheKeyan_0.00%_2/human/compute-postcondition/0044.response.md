Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is an empty list, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in an empty list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in an empty list, `res` is 0**

Explanation:
- `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers provided by the user.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `coord`, `p1`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged.
