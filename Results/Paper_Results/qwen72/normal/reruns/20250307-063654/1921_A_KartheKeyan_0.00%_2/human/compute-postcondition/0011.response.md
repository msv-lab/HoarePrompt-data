The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the constant `4` in the `range(4)` function, so we can only adjust `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and it must still be less than 4.

State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are input integers.**
