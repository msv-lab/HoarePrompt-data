The code snippet `coord.append((x, y))` appends a tuple containing the values of `x` and `y` to the list `coord`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` and `y` are input integers, `coord` contains the tuple `(x, y)` as its last element.**
