Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in an empty list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in an empty list, `res` is 0**

The tuple `(x, y)` has been appended to the list `coord`, which now contains one tuple. The values of `i`, `n`, `p1`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` have been updated to new input integers.
