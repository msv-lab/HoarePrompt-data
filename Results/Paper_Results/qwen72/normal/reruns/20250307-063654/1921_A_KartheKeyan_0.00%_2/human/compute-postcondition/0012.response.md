Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `s` is the last calculated value based on the input `l`, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to the new input integers.**

The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x` and `y` to new input integers provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.
