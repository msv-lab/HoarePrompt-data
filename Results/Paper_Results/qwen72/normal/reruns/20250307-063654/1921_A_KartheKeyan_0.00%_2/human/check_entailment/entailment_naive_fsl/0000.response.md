Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the side length of the square. The program assumes that the distance between the first and second points (after sorting) and the distance between the third and fourth points (after sorting) will give the side length of the square, which is not always true. The correct approach would be to find the unique x and y coordinates and calculate the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x (or y) coordinates. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
1 1
1 4
4 1
4 4
```

Expected Output:
```
9
```

Actual Output:
```
3.0
```

The program calculates the side length incorrectly, leading to an incorrect area. The correct area should be 9 (3 * 3), but the program outputs 3.0, which is the side length, not the area.
