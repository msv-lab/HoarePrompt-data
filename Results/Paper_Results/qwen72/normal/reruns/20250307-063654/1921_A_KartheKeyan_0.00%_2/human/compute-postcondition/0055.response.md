Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a list containing 4 tuples, each tuple representing a pair of input integers, but now sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the sorted list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the sorted list, `res` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `p2` to the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the sorted `coord` list.
- `p2` is calculated as `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `coord`, `p1`, `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
