Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading 4 pairs of coordinates. This matches the problem description.

2. **Sorting Coordinates**: The function sorts the list of coordinates. Sorting the coordinates is a good approach because it ensures that the points are in a predictable order, which can help in calculating the side lengths of the square. However, the sorting is only done based on the x-coordinates, which might not be sufficient to correctly identify the side lengths of the square.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths**: The function calculates `p1` and `p2` as the squared Euclidean distances between specific pairs of points. However, the choice of points (specifically, `coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]` and `coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]`) is problematic. The correct approach should be to calculate the side length of the square by finding the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates between adjacent points in the sorted list.

4. **Area Calculation**: The function calculates the area by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2`, multiplying them, and then taking the absolute value. This is unnecessary and incorrect. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be directly calculated by the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates. The area is then the square of this side length.

5. **Output**: The function prints the calculated area for each test case, which is correct according to the problem description.

Given the issues with the sorting and the calculation of the side lengths, the function will not correctly compute the area of the square in all cases.

Correctness: **False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        
        for i in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort the coordinates first by x, then by y
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]  # Difference in x-coordinates of the first two points
        if side_length == 0:
            side_length = coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]  # Difference in y-coordinates of the first two points
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1
```

This corrected program ensures that the side length is correctly calculated by considering the differences in both x and y coordinates, and it correctly computes the area of the square.
