Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are updated to new input integers, `coord` is a list containing 4 tuples, each tuple representing a pair of input integers, but now sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the sorted list, `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the sorted list, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated to the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
- `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the sorted list `coord`.
- `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth tuples in the sorted list `coord`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `coord` remain unchanged.
- The values of `p1` and `p2` are not explicitly provided, so `res` is expressed in terms of these variables.
