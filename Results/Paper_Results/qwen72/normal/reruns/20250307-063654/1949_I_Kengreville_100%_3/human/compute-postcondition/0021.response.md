Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `visited[i]` is `True`, `coef[i]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`, and the current value of `visited[i]` is `True`.**

Explanation:
- The `dfs(i)` function call updates the `visited[i]` to `True`, indicating that the node `i` has been visited.
- The `coef[i]` is already set to 1, so it remains 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
