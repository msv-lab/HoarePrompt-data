Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `i` is `n-1`.
3. `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
4. The `visited` and `coef` lists are updated such that for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `visited[i]` was `False` at the start of the loop, it is now `True` and `coef[i]` is set to 1.
5. `tot` is 0.
6. `bipartite` is `True`.
7. `ok` is `True` because at least one `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0 after any iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables and lists, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.
- The condition that `ok` is `True` because at least one `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0 after any iteration is given, which implies that the program has reached a state where it is appropriate to print `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
