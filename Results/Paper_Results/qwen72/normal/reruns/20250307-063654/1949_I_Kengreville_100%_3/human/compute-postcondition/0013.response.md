Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively. `tot` is 0.**

The variable `tot` is now initialized to 0. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
