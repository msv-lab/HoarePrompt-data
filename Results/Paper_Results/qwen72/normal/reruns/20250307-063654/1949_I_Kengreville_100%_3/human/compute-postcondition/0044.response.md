The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, it is implied that the function operates on the following parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, where -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n.
- `visited` is a list of booleans, each of length `n`, initially all set to `False`.
- `coef` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, initially all set to `None`.

Since the function definition does not specify any return value, it is assumed that the function may modify the input parameters or perform some operations without returning a value explicitly.

Functionality: **The function operates on a set of parameters including an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 1000), lists of integers `x`, `y`, and `r` (each of length `n` with specific bounds), a list of booleans `visited` (each of length `n` and initially all `False`), and a list of integers `coef` (each of length `n` and initially all `None`). The function may modify these parameters or perform operations based on them but does not return any value explicitly.**
