Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`. `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`. `r` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `visited` is a list of booleans, each of length `n`, initially all set to False. `coef` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, initially all set to None.**

The list `y` is now a list of `None` values of length `n`, replacing the previous list of integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
