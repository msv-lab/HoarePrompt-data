Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively, except `visited[i]` is `True` and `coef[i]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`**

The code `coef[i] = 1` updates the value of `coef[i]` to 1, where `i` is 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update while maintaining all other initial conditions.
