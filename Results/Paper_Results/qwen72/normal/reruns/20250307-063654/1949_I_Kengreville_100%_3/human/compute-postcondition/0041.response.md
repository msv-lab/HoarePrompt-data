Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The `visited` and `coef` lists are updated such that for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `visited[i]` was `False` at the start of the loop, it is now `True` and `coef[i]` is set to 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `False`.**
