Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`. `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`. `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`. `visited` is a list of booleans, each of length `n`, initially all set to False. `coef` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, initially all set to None.**

The code `r = [None] * n` reassigns the list `r` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`. The previous values of `r` (which were integers where 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9) are replaced with `None`. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `visited`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.
