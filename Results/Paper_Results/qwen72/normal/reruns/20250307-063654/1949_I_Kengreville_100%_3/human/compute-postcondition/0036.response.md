Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively, except `visited[i]` is `True` and `coef[i]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False` or (`bipartite` and `tot != 0`).**

Explanation:
- The value of `ok` is updated to be `False` or the result of the expression `bipartite and tot != 0`.
- Since `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is 0, the expression `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to `False`.
- Therefore, `ok` remains `False`.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
