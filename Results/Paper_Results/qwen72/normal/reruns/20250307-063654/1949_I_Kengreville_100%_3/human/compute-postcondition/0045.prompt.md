You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. x, y, and r are lists of integers, each of length n, where -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. visited is a list of booleans, each of length n, initially all set to False. coef is a list of integers, each of length n, initially all set to None.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The `visited` and `coef` lists are updated such that for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `visited[i]` was `False` at the start of the loop, it is now `True` and `coef[i]` is set to 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `True` if at least one `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0 after any iteration, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The `visited` and `coef` lists are updated such that for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `visited[i]` was `False` at the start of the loop, it is now `True` and `coef[i]` is set to 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`. If `ok` was `True` at the start of the if-else block, it remains `True` because at least one `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0 after any iteration. Otherwise, `ok` remains `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates on a set of parameters including an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 1000), lists of integers `x`, `y`, and `r` (each of length `n` with specific bounds), a list of booleans `visited` (each of length `n` and initially all `False`), and a list of integers `coef` (each of length `n` and initially all `None`). The function may modify these parameters or perform operations based on them but does not return any value explicitly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
