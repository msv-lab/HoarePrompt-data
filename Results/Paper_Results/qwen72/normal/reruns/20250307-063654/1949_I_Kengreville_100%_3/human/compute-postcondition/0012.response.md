Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` must be greater than 0.
- The loop variable `i` will be `n-1` after the last iteration.
- Each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will have been assigned an integer value from the input, corresponding to the respective iteration.
- The `visited` list will still contain `False` for all its elements.
- The `coef` list will still contain `None` for all its elements.
