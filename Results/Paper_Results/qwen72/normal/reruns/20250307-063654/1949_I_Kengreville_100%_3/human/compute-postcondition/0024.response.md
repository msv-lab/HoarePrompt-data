The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[i]` is set to `True` and `coef[i]` is set to 1.**
