Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, where -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `visited` is a list of booleans, each of length `n`, initially all set to False. `coef` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, initially all set to None.**
