Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively, except if `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[i]` is set to `True` and `coef[i]` is set to 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.***
