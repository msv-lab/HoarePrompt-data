Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively, except `coef[i]` is now 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`.** 

The code snippet `bipartite = True` sets the variable `bipartite` to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
