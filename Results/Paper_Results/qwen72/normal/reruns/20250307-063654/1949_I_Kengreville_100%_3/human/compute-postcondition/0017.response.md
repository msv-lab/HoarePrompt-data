Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`, and the current value of `visited[i]` is `False`.**
