i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n. n, x, y, r, visited, tot, bipartite, and coef are defined outside this function. n is the number of disks, x and y are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks, r is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks, visited is a list of booleans indicating whether a disk has been visited, tot is an integer representing the total sum of coefficients, bipartite is a boolean indicating if the graph is bipartite, and coef is a list of integers representing the coefficients of the disks.
