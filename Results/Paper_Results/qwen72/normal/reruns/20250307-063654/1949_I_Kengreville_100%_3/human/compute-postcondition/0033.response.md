Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively, except `visited[i]` is `True` and `coef[i]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`**

Explanation:
- The code `tot = 0` sets the variable `tot` to 0.
- Since `tot` is now 0, and `bipartite` is `True`, the condition for `ok` (which is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0) is not met, so `ok` remains `False`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
