Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively, except if `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[i]` is set to `True` and `coef[i]` is set to 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `False` if `visited[i]` was `True` and `tot` is 0. Otherwise, `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0.***
