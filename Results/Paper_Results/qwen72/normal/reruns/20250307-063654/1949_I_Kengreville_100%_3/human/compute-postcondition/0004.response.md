Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000. `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`. `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`. `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`. `visited` is a list of `False` values of length `n`. `coef` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, initially all set to `None`.** 

The code reassigns `visited` to a list of `False` values of length `n`, which matches its initial state. Therefore, the state of `visited` remains unchanged. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `coef`) and the value of `n` remain the same as in the initial state.
