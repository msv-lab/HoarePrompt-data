Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The `visited` and `coef` lists are updated such that for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `visited[i]` was `False` at the start of the loop, it is now `True` and `coef[i]` is set to 1. `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `True` if at least one `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0 after any iteration, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has run `n` times, where `n` is the length of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`.
- For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `visited[i]` was initially `False`, it is now `True`, and `coef[i]` is set to 1.
- The variable `tot` remains 0 because it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration.
- The variable `bipartite` remains `True` because it is reset to `True` at the start of each iteration.
- The variable `ok` is `True` if at least one iteration resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` being not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.
