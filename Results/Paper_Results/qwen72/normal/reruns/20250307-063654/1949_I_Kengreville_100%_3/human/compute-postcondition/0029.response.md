Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged, with all values being `False` and `None` respectively, except `coef[i]` is now 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0` updates the value of `ok` based on the logical expression. Given that `ok` is initially `False`, `bipartite` is `True`, and `tot` is 0, the expression `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to `False` (since `tot` is 0). Therefore, `ok` remains `False` if `tot` is 0. However, if `tot` is not 0, `ok` will be updated to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
