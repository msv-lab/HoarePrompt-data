The function `func_1` processes a set of inputs representing `n` points in a 2D plane, each with coordinates `(x[i], y[i])` and a radius `r[i]`. It initializes a `visited` list to track which points have been processed and a `coef` list to store coefficients. The function then performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the points, updating the `visited` and `coef` lists. After processing all points, it prints 'YES' if at least one DFS iteration results in a bipartite condition being true and a non-zero total, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value explicitly.
