Output State: **The screen is cleared, but the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The `os.system('cls')` command clears the screen, but it does not affect the values of the variables `t` and `n`. Therefore, the output state includes the cleared screen and the unchanged values of `t` and `n`.
