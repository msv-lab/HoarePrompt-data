Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is an empty string if `n` is 1. If `n` is even and at least 2, `ans` is the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and greater than or equal to 7, `ans` is 'ABBCBAcc' + 'DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'[4:(n // 2 - 1) * 2], and `x` is (n // 2 - 1) + 1, `j` is (n // 2 - 2).***
