Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2 and even, `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice, `x` is 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s`, repeated twice, to the existing value of `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice.
- `x` is 1, so `s[x]` is the second character of `s`.
- `s[x] * 2` repeats the second character of `s` twice.
- Therefore, `ans` is updated to include the first character of `s` repeated twice, followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
