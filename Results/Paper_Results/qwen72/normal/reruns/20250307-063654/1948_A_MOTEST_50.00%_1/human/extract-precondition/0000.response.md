Precondition: **The function should take an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be:

```python
def func(t, n_list):
```

Where:
- **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases.**
- **n_list is a list of integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) where each integer n represents the number of special characters required for the corresponding test case.**
