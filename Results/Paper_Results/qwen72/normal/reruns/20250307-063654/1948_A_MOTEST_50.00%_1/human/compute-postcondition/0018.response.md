Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2 and even, `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice, followed by the third character of `s` repeated twice, `x` is 2, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `x` of the string `s`, repeated twice.
- The initial value of `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice.
- The value of `x` is 2, so the character at index 2 of `s` (the third character) is repeated twice and appended to `ans`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
