Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables and `ans` remains an empty string. If `n` is even and at least 2, `ans` is the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and greater than or equal to 7, `ans` is 'ABBCBAcc' + the characters from `s[4]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice, and `x` is `(n // 2 - 1) + 1`, `j` is `(n // 2 - 2)`. If `n` is odd and less than 7, `ans` is 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.***
