Functionality: ** The function `func` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads another integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` that contains exactly `n` uppercase letters. If `n` is even, `ans` consists of the first `n // 2` letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice. If `n` is odd and greater than 1, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and is followed by the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. **
