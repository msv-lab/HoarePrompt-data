Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (this is not directly relevant to the `print(ans)` statement).
- `i` is 0 (this is not directly relevant to the `print(ans)` statement).
- `n` is an input integer not equal to 1.
- `x` is `n // 2`.
- `j` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 2` if `n` is odd.
- `ans` is defined based on the parity of `n`:
  - If `n` is even, `ans` is the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice.
  - If `n` is odd, `ans` is 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `x`**:
   - `x` is `n // 2`, which means `x` is the integer division of `n` by 2.

2. **Determine the value of `j`**:
   - If `n` is even, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - If `n` is odd, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.

3. **Determine the value of `ans`**:
   - **If `n` is even**:
     - `ans` is the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice.
     - For example, if `n = 4` and `s = 'ABCD'`, then `ans` would be `AABB`.
   - **If `n` is odd**:
     - `ans` is 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice.
     - For example, if `n = 5` and `s = 'ABCDE'`, then `ans` would be `AAA` + `BCCD`.

### Final Output:
- **If `n` is even**:
  - `ans` will be the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice.
  - Output: **[first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice]**
- **If `n` is odd**:
  - `ans` will be 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice.
  - Output: **'AAA' + [characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice]**

### Example:
- **If `n = 4` and `s = 'ABCD'`**:
  - `x = 4 // 2 = 2`
  - `j = 2 - 1 = 1`
  - `ans = 'AABB'`
  - Output: **AABB**
- **If `n = 5` and `s = 'ABCDE'`**:
  - `x = 5 // 2 = 2`
  - `j = 2 - 2 = 0`
  - `ans = 'AAA' + 'BCCD'`
  - Output: **AAABCCD**

### General Output:
- **If `n` is even**:
  - Output: **[first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice]**
- **If `n` is odd**:
  - Output: **'AAA' + [characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice]**

Output: **[first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice] if `n` is even, or 'AAA' + [characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice] if `n` is odd**
