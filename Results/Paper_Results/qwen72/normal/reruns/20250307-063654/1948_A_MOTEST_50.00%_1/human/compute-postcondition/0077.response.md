Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AACD', `x` is 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by appending the character at index `x` in the string `s` twice. Initially, `ans` is 'AA' and `x` is 1. The character at index 1 in `s` is 'B'. Therefore, `ans` becomes 'AA' + 'B' * 2, which is 'AACD'. The other variables remain unchanged.
