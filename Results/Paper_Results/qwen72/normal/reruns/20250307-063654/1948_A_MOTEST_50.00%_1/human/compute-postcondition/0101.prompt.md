You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t` (the number of iterations completed), `n` is an input integer, and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables and `ans` remains an empty string. If `n` is even, `ans` is the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and greater than or equal to 7, `ans` is 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice, and `x` is `(n // 2 - 1) + 1`, `j` is `(n // 2 - 2)`. If `n` is odd and less than 7, `ans` is 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and `n` is the number of special characters required in the string for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). It returns a list of strings, each containing exactly `n` special characters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
