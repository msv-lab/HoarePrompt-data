### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The program checks if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as a character equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because any string with a single special character would either have no special characters or more than one special character.
   
3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is not 1, the program constructs a string `ans` to meet the requirement of having `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating pairs of the same character from the uppercase alphabet. For example, for `n = 6`, it constructs `AA BB CC` (which becomes `AABBCC`).
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with the string 'AAA' and then continues to add pairs of the same character. For example, for `n = 5`, it constructs `AAA BB CC` (which becomes `AAABBCC`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string if the string can be built.
   - The constructed string will have a length of at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly by printing 'NO'.
   - The program ensures that the string length does not exceed 200 by using the uppercase alphabet and constructing pairs of characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. It constructs a valid string for all valid inputs and prints 'NO' when it is impossible to construct such a string.

Correctness: **True**
