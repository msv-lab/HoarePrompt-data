Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `ans` to an empty string. Since no other operations are performed in the given code, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The only change is that `ans` is now an empty string.
