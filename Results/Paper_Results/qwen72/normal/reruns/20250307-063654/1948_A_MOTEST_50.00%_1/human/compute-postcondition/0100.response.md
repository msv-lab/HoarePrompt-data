The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of special characters required in the string, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The function returns a list of strings, where each string contains exactly `n` special characters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and `n` is the number of special characters required in the string for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). It returns a list of strings, each containing exactly `n` special characters.**
