Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 5, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'ABBA', `x` is 1, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the variable `ans` by appending the character at index `x` of the string `s` twice. Since `x` is 1, the character at index 1 of `s` is 'B'. Therefore, `ans` changes from 'AAA' to 'ABBA'. The other variables remain unchanged.
