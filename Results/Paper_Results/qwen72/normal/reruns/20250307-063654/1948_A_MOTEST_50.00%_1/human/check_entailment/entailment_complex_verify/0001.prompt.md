You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

Output

    NO
    YES
    MM

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t` (the number of iterations completed), `n` is an input integer, and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables and `ans` remains an empty string. If `n` is even, `ans` is the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and greater than or equal to 7, `ans` is 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice, and `x` is `(n // 2 - 1) + 1`, `j` is `(n // 2 - 2)`. If `n` is odd and less than 7, `ans` is 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads another integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` that contains exactly `n` uppercase letters. If `n` is even, `ans` consists of the first `n // 2` letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice. If `n` is odd and greater than 1, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and is followed by the next `n // 2 - 1` letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The program checks if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as a character equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because any string with a single special character would either have no special characters or more than one special character.
   
3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is not 1, the program constructs a string `ans` to meet the requirement of having `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating pairs of the same character from the uppercase alphabet. For example, for `n = 6`, it constructs `AA BB CC` (which becomes `AABBCC`).
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with the string 'AAA' and then continues to add pairs of the same character. For example, for `n = 5`, it constructs `AAA BB CC` (which becomes `AAABBCC`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string if the string can be built.
   - The constructed string will have a length of at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly by printing 'NO'.
   - The program ensures that the string length does not exceed 200 by using the uppercase alphabet and constructing pairs of characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. It constructs a valid string for all valid inputs and prints 'NO' when it is impossible to construct such a string.
