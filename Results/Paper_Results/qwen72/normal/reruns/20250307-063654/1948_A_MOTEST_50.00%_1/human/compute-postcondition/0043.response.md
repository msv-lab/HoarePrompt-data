Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 0, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` (which is 'A') repeated twice to the string `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, it now becomes 'AA'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
