Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
   - `ans` is an empty string if `n` is 1.
   - If `n` is even and at least 2:
     - `ans` is the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice.
     - `x` is `n // 2`.
     - `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - If `n` is odd and greater than or equal to 7:
     - `ans` is 'ABBCBAcc' + 'DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'[4:(n // 2 - 1) * 2].
     - `x` is (n // 2 - 1) + 1.
     - `j` is (n // 2 - 2).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print('YES')` is a simple statement that prints the string 'YES'.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `ans`, `x`, and `j`, but none of these variables are used in the print statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the print statement is independent of the initial state and will always be 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
