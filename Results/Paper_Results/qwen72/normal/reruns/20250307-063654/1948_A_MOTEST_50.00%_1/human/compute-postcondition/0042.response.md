The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value. This means that `n // 2` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 (since `n // 2` will be 1 if `n` is 2 or 3, and 0 if `n` is 1).

Before the loop starts, `j` should be 0, and `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is an empty string, `x` is 0, `j` is 0**
