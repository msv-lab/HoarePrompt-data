Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 5, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AABBCDEE', `x` is 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` (which is 'C') twice to the string `ans`. The previous value of `ans` was 'AABBCD', so after appending 'C' twice, `ans` becomes 'AABBCDEE'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
