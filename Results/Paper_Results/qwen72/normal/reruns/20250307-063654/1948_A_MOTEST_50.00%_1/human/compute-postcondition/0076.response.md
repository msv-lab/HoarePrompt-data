The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be at least 2 to ensure that `n // 2` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 1, `j` is 1**
