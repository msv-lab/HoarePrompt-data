Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `os.system('cls')` to clear the screen. This is unnecessary and can cause issues on systems that do not support the `cls` command (e.g., Unix-based systems which use `clear`).
   - The program should handle the input without clearing the screen.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly identifies that there is no suitable string for `n = 1` and prints `NO`.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where `n = 2` correctly. It should print `YES` followed by a string like `MM` or `AA`, but it does not.

3. **String Construction:**
   - The program constructs the string by repeating pairs of the same character. This is a valid approach, but it fails for `n = 2` because it does not print the string.
   - The program should ensure that the string is printed for all valid `n` values.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program should print `YES` followed by the constructed string for valid `n` values.
   - For `n = 1`, it correctly prints `NO`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import string

def func():
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans = 'AAA'
                x = 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the string is printed for all valid `n` values, including `n = 2`.
