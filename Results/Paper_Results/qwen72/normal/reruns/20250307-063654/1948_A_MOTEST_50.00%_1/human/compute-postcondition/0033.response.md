Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer not equal to 1, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 2` if `n` is odd. If `n` is even, `ans` is the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` is 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice.***
