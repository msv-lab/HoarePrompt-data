Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `x` is `n // 2` if `n` is even, otherwise `x` is `n // 2 - 1`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, otherwise `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, and `ans` is the string formed by repeating the first `n // 2` characters of `s` twice if `n` is even, otherwise `ans` is 'ABBA' + 'CC' * 2 + 'DD' * 2 + ... + `s[n//2 - 2]` * 2.***
