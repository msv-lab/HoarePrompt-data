The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and even. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0 and even.

Since `n` is even and greater than 0, `n // 2` will be an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be 1, and `n // 2` must be greater than 1, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2 and even, `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice, `x` is 1, `j` is 1**
