Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AABBCD', `x` is 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` twice to the string `ans`.
- The initial value of `ans` is 'AA'.
- The initial value of `x` is 1, so the character at index 1 in `s` (which is 'B') is appended twice to `ans`.
- Therefore, `ans` becomes 'AABBCD'.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
