Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The screen is cleared, `t` is an input integer, `n` remains unchanged, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans = ''
        x = 0
        if n % 2 == 0:
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        else:
            ans, x = 'AAA', 1
            for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is not 1, `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 2` if `n` is odd. If `n` is even, `ans` is the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` is 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is not 1, `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 2` if `n` is odd. If `n` is even, `ans` is the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` is 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables and `ans` remains an empty string. If `n` is even and at least 2, `ans` is the first `n // 2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and greater than or equal to 7, `ans` is 'ABBCBAcc' + the characters from `s[4]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice, and `x` is `(n // 2 - 1) + 1`, `j` is `(n // 2 - 2)`. If `n` is odd and less than 7, `ans` is 'AAA' + the characters from `s[1]` to `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` each repeated twice, and `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
