Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 5, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AACDEE', `x` is 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` (which is 'C') twice to the string `ans`. Since `x` is 2, the character at index 2 in `s` is 'C', and `ans` was initially 'AACD'. After the operation, `ans` becomes 'AACDEE'. The other variables remain unchanged.
