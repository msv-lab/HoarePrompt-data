Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We have an array `a` of `n` integers.
- We can apply an operation to select three integers `i`, `j`, `x` (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from `i` to `j` the value `x`. The price of this operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles.
- The goal is to make all elements of the array equal with the minimum cost.

### Given Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    if arr[0] == arr[-1]:
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array `arr` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the current element is equal to the next element.
   - It moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the current element is equal to the previous element.
   - If the first element `arr[0]` is equal to the last element `arr[-1]`, it returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array is already all the same, the cost should be 0. The program correctly handles this case by checking if `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and returning 0 if true.
   - If the array has only one element, the cost should also be 0. The program correctly handles this case as well.

2. **General Case:**
   - The program aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal by identifying the longest contiguous segment of the same value at the start and end of the array.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, the cost is the length of the segment in the middle that needs to be changed, which is `j - i - 1`.
   - If the first and last elements are different, the program calculates the minimum cost by considering the segment from `i` to the end or from the start to `j`.

3. **Logic:**
   - The logic of moving `i` and `j` to find the longest contiguous segments of the same value at the start and end is correct.
   - The cost calculation for the general case is also correct. The program ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by considering the segment that needs to be changed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and the general case as described in the problem. The logic and the cost calculation are sound.

Correctness: **True**
