Output State: **The program returns the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1), where `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, or `0` if no such index exists, and `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.**
