Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of making all elements of an array equal with the minimum cost, where the cost is defined as the number of elements being assigned a new value. The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum cost by identifying the longest contiguous segment of the array that can be left unchanged, and then calculating the cost of changing the remaining elements.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the current element is equal to the next element. This identifies the longest contiguous segment from the start that is already equal.
   - Similarly, it moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the current element is equal to the previous element. This identifies the longest contiguous segment from the end that is already equal.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal, it means the entire array can be made equal by changing the elements between `i` and `j` (exclusive). The cost is `j - i - 1`, but it ensures the cost is not negative by using `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - If the first and last elements are not equal, the program calculates the minimum cost to make the array equal by either:
     - Changing all elements from `i` to the end (`n - i - 1`).
     - Changing all elements from the start to `j` (`j`).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the array are already equal, the function correctly returns `0` because no changes are needed.
   - If the array has only one element, the function correctly returns `0` because the array is already equal.
   - If the array has two elements and they are not equal, the function correctly returns `1` because only one element needs to be changed.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The function `func_1` runs in O(n) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

Based on the reasoning and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly handle the problem as described and produce the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
