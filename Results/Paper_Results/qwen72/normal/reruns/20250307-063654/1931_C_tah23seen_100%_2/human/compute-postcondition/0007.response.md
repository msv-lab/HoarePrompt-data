The variables in the loop head are `i` and `arr`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1` and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1
- `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]` and `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1`. Since `i` is 2, `len(arr) - 1` must be greater than 2, which means `len(arr)` must be greater than 3.
- `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 2, `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `len(arr) > 3` and `arr[2] == arr[3]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 2; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 3; `j` is `n - 1`; `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]` and `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]` and `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`**
