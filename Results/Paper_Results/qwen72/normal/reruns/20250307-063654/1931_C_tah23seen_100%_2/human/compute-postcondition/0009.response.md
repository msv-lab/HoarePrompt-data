Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `arr` remains unchanged.
- The variable `i` will be the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to the element immediately following it. If all elements in `arr` are equal, `i` will be `len(arr) - 1`.
- The variable `n` remains the length of `arr`, and it must be greater than 1.
- The variable `j` remains `n - 1`.
