### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array `arr` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the current element is equal to the next element.
   - It moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the current element is equal to the previous element.
   - If the first element `arr[0]` is equal to the last element `arr[-1]`, it returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All elements are the same:** If the array is already all the same, the cost should be 0. The program correctly handles this case by checking if `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and returning 0 if true.
   - **Single element array:** If the array has only one element, the cost should also be 0. The program correctly handles this case as well because `i` and `j` will both be 0, and the condition `arr[0] == arr[-1]` will be true.

4. **General Case:**
   - The program aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal by identifying the longest contiguous segment of the same value at the start and end of the array.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, the cost is the length of the segment in the middle that needs to be changed, which is `j - i - 1`.
   - If the first and last elements are different, the program calculates the minimum cost by considering the segment from `i` to the end or from the start to `j`.

5. **Logic:**
   - The logic of moving `i` and `j` to find the longest contiguous segments of the same value at the start and end is correct.
   - The cost calculation for the general case is also correct. The program ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by considering the segment that needs to be changed.

6. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: `6`, `1 2 3 4 5 1`
     - `i` will be 0 (since `arr[0]` is 1 and `arr[1]` is 2).
     - `j` will be 5 (since `arr[5]` is 1 and `arr[4]` is 5).
     - `arr[0]` is not equal to `arr[-1]`, so the program returns `max(min(6 - 0 - 1, 5), 0) = max(5, 5) = 5`.
     - **Correct output should be 4**, but the program returns 5. This is incorrect.
   
   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: `7`, `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - `i` will be 6 (since all elements are the same).
     - `j` will be 0 (since all elements are the same).
     - `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[-1]`, so the program returns `max(0 - 6 - 1, 0) = 0`.
     - **Correct output is 0**, and the program returns 0. This is correct.
   
   - **Example 3:**
     - Input: `8`, `8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8`
     - `i` will be 3 (since `arr[3]` is 1 and `arr[2]` is 8).
     - `j` will be 4 (since `arr[4]` is 2 and `arr[5]` is 8).
     - `arr[0]` is not equal to `arr[-1]`, so the program returns `max(min(8 - 3 - 1, 4), 0) = max(4, 4) = 4`.
     - **Correct output should be 2**, but the program returns 4. This is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect because the program does not handle the general case correctly. Specifically, the cost calculation for the general case is flawed. The program should consider the minimum cost to make the entire array equal by either changing the segment from `i` to the end or from the start to `j`, but it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost in all scenarios.

Final: **False**
