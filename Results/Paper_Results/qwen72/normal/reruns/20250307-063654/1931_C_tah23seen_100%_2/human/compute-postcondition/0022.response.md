Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns an integer. It calculates the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1) if the first and last elements of `arr` are equal, where `i` is the index of the first element that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal, and `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, or `0` if no such index exists. If the first and last elements of `arr` are not equal, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. **
