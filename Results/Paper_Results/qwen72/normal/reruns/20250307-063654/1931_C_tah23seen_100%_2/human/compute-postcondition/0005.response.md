To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is:
```
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

This condition has two parts:
1. `i < len(arr) - 1`: This ensures that `i` is within the bounds of the array such that `arr[i + 1]` is a valid index.
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`: This ensures that the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is `n - 1`.
- `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1`.
- `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Let's check each part:
1. `i < len(arr) - 1`: Since `i` is 1, this condition will be true as long as `len(arr) > 2`. Given that `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1, this condition is already satisfied.
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`: We need to ensure that `arr[1]` is equal to `arr[2]` for the loop to execute again. The state given only tells us that `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[1]`, but does not provide information about `arr[2]`.

Since we cannot make assumptions about the values of `arr[2]` or any other elements in the array, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `arr[1]` is equal to `arr[2]`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 1; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is `n - 1`; `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]` and `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`**
