### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.
   - The function starts by initializing `i` to 0 and `j` to `len(arr) - 1`.

3. **Finding the First and Last Non-Matching Elements:**
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` until it finds the first element that is not equal to its next element. This helps in identifying the start of the segment that needs to be modified.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` until it finds the last element that is not equal to its previous element. This helps in identifying the end of the segment that needs to be modified.

4. **Handling the Case Where All Elements Are Equal:**
   - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, it means the array is already equal or the segment that needs to be modified is between `i` and `j`.
   - The function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which correctly calculates the length of the segment that needs to be modified, ensuring it does not return a negative value.

5. **Handling the Case Where the First and Last Elements Are Different:**
   - If `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, the function returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.
   - This calculation ensures that the minimum number of burles is spent by either:
     - Modifying the segment from `i` to the end of the array (`n - i - 1`).
     - Modifying the segment from the start of the array to `j` (`j`).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array has only one element, the function will return 0, which is correct because no operation is needed.
   - If the array has two elements and they are different, the function will return 1, which is correct because one operation is needed to make them equal.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. It handles all edge cases and the main logic efficiently.

**Correctness: True**
