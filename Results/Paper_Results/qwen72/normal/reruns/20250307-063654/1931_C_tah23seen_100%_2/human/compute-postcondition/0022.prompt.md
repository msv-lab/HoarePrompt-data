You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is `n - 1`.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, or `0` if no such index exists.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1), where `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, or `0` if no such index exists, and `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, or `0` if no such index exists; and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, where `n` is the length of `arr`, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal, and `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, or `0` if no such index exists.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1) if there is a largest index `j` where `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, and `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element. If no such index `j` exists or all elements are equal, it returns 0. Alternatively, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j` if the conditions for `j` and `i` are met, where `n` is the length of `arr`. If no such index `j` exists or all elements are equal, it returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1), where `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, or `0` if no such index exists, and `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, where `n` is the length of `arr`, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal, and `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, or `0` if no such index exists.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
