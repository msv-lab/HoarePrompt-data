You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description:
- We have an array `a` of `n` integers.
- We can apply an operation to select three integers `i`, `j`, `x` (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from `i` to `j` the value `x`. The price of this operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles.
- The goal is to make all elements of the array equal with the minimum cost.

### Given Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    if arr[0] == arr[-1]:
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array `arr` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the current element is equal to the next element.
   - It moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the current element is equal to the previous element.
   - If the first element `arr[0]` is equal to the last element `arr[-1]`, it returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array is already all the same, the cost should be 0. The program correctly handles this case by checking if `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and returning 0 if true.
   - If the array has only one element, the cost should also be 0. The program correctly handles this case as well.

2. **General Case:**
   - The program aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal by identifying the longest contiguous segment of the same value at the start and end of the array.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, the cost is the length of the segment in the middle that needs to be changed, which is `j - i - 1`.
   - If the first and last elements are different, the program calculates the minimum cost by considering the segment from `i` to the end or from the start to `j`.

3. **Logic:**
   - The logic of moving `i` and `j` to find the longest contiguous segments of the same value at the start and end is correct.
   - The cost calculation for the general case is also correct. The program ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by considering the segment that needs to be changed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and the general case as described in the problem. The logic and the cost calculation are sound.

Correctness: **True**
