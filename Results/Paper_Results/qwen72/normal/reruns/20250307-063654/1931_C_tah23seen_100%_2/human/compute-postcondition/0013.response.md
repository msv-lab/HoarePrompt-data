Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 2; `j` is `n - 3` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` is now `n - 3`.
- The condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` still holds true because `j` was initially `n - 2` and now it is `n - 3`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
