The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and the length of `arr`.

**Case_1:** If there exists a largest index `j` such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, the function returns the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1), where `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element. If no such index `j` exists, or if all elements are equal, the function returns 0.

**Case_2:** If there exists a largest index `j` such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, and an index `i` of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, the function returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. If no such index `j` exists, or if all elements are equal, the function returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1) if there is a largest index `j` where `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, and `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element. If no such index `j` exists or all elements are equal, it returns 0. Alternatively, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j` if the conditions for `j` and `i` are met, where `n` is the length of `arr`. If no such index `j` exists or all elements are equal, it returns 0.**
