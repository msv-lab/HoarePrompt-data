To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
- `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

### Analysis:
- The condition `j > 0` must be true for the loop to start. Since `j` is `n - 1` and `n` is greater than 1, `j` will be at least 1, so this condition is already satisfied.
- The condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` must also be true for the loop to start. This means that the last element of `arr` (at index `j`) must be equal to the second-to-last element (at index `j - 1`).

### Adjustments:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `arr`. However, we cannot change the values of `arr` directly as part of the state, but we can ensure that the condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` is met.
- To meet the condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`, we need to ensure that the last element and the second-to-last element of `arr` are equal.

### Final State:
Since `j` is already greater than 0 and `n` is greater than 1, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is `n - 1` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**
