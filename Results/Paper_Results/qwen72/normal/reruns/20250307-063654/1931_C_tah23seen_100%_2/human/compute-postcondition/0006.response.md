Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 2; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is `n - 1`; `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]` and `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`**

The value of `i` has been incremented from 1 to 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
