### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array `arr` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the current element is equal to the next element. This effectively finds the first position where the elements differ from the start.
   - It moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the current element is equal to the previous element. This effectively finds the first position where the elements differ from the end.
   - If the first element `arr[0]` is equal to the last element `arr[-1]`, it returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This is correct because if the first and last elements are the same, the cost is the length of the segment in the middle that needs to be changed.
   - If the first and last elements are different, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This is also correct because it considers the minimum cost by either changing the segment from `i` to the end or from the start to `j`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All elements are the same:** The program correctly returns 0 because `i` will move to `len(arr) - 1` and `j` will move to 0, making `j - i - 1` equal to 0.
   - **Array has only one element:** The program correctly returns 0 because `i` and `j` will both be 0, and `max(j - i - 1, 0)` will be 0.
   - **First and last elements are different:** The program correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering the segment from `i` to the end or from the start to `j`.

4. **General Case:**
   - The logic of moving `i` and `j` to find the longest contiguous segments of the same value at the start and end is correct.
   - The cost calculation for the general case is also correct. The program ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by considering the segment that needs to be changed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and the general case as described in the problem. The logic and the cost calculation are sound.

Final: **True**
