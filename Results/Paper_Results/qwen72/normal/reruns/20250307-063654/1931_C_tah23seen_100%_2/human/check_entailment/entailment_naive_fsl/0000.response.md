Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal strategy for making all elements of the array equal. The function `func_1` only checks the edges of the array and the contiguous segments of equal elements at the beginning and end. However, it does not consider the possibility of selecting a value `x` that is not at the edges of the array but is the most frequent value within the array.

For example, consider the array `[2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]`. The correct answer should be 3 burles, as you can set the middle three elements to 2, which costs 3 burles. However, the provided program will return 4 burles, as it only considers the segments at the beginning and end of the array.

This indicates that the program is not optimal and does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
