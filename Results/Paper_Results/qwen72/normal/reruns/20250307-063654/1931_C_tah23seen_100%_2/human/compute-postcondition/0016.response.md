Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1; `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j >= 0`, or `0` if no such index exists.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `j` will be the largest index in the list `arr` where the element at index `j` is equal to the element at index `j - 1`, and `j` will be at least 0. If no such index exists (i.e., no consecutive elements are equal), `j` will be 0. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
