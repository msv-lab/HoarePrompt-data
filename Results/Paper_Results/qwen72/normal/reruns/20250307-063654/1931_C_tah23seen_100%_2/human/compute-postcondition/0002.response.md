Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `n` is the length of `arr`; `j` is `n - 1`.**

The initial state remains the same, with the addition that the variable `j` is now assigned the value `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
