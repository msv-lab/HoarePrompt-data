Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 2Â·10^4, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer value of a character in `input_string`, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n / 2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.***
