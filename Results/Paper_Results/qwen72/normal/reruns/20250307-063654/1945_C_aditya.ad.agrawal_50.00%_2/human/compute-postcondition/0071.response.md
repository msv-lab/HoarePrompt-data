Output State: **`pos` is 1, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string` and must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr` and its current value is 0, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001.**
