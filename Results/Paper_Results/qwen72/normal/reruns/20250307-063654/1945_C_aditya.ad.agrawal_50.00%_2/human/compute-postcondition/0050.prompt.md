Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 2Â·10^4, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer value of a character in `input_string`, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n / 2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, and `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1, and the current values of `z_l` and `z_r` satisfy `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1, and the current values of `o_l` and `o_r` satisfy `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is equal to the current value of `pos` and `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, the program does not modify `ans` or `b_d`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `ans` and `b_d` remain unchanged if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is not met. If the condition is met, `ans` is set to `pos`, `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and if `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`arr` must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, and `pos` is increased by 1. If the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is met, `ans` is set to `pos`, `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and if `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1. If the condition is not met, `ans` and `b_d` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
