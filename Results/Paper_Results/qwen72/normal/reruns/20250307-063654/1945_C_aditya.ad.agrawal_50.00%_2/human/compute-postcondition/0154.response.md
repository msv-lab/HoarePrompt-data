The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from stdin. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), which represents the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), representing the number of houses, and the second line contains a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of '0' and '1'. Here, '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side of the road, and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns the number of swaps needed to arrange all residents such that all '0's are on the left side and all '1's are on the right side of the road for each test case.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from stdin, where each test case includes the number of houses and a string indicating the preferred side of the road for each resident. It returns the number of swaps needed to arrange all residents such that all '0's are on the left side and all '1's are on the right side for each test case.**
