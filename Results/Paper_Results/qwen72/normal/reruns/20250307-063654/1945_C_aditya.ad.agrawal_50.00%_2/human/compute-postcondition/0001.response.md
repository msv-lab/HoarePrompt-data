The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2·10^4, which means `t` is already non-zero and within a valid range.

Since `t` is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute at least once, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2·10^4, representing the number of test cases.**
