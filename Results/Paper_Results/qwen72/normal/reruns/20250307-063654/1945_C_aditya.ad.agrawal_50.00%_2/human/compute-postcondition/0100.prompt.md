Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string`, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`pos` is 1, `z_l` is 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0. `o_l` is 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_l` is 0. `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr`. `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr`. `ans` is 0 if the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` are not all met. If all these conditions are met, `ans` is 1. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string` and must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 1)` if the conditions are met, otherwise `b_d` is 30001.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `pos` is 2, `z_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, or 0 if the second element of `arr` is not 0, `o_l` is 0 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is not 0, or 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `ans` is 2 if the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` are all met. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 2)` if the conditions are met, otherwise `b_d` is 30001.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`pos` is 3, `z_l` is 3 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is not 0, or 1 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is 0, or 0 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is not 0, `o_l` is 0 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is 0, or 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is not 0, or 3 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is not 0, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 3 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is not 0, or the number of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is 0, or the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is not 0, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 2, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 3)`. If the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` are all met, `ans` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
