To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in arr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the current element being iterated over in the list `arr`. The state of `i` will change to the next element in `arr` at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `pos` is 2
- `z_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, or 0 if the second element of `arr` is not 0
- `o_l` is 0 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is not 0, or 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0
- `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1
- `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 1
- `ans` is 2 if the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` are all met. Otherwise, `ans` is 0
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `input_string` is the user input
- `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string` and must have at least two elements
- `i` is the second element of `arr`
- `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`
- `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`
- `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`
- `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 2)` if the conditions are met, otherwise `b_d` is 30001

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the third element of `arr`. The other variables in the loop head (`arr`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`pos` is 2, `z_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, or 0 if the second element of `arr` is not 0, `o_l` is 0 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is not 0, or 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `ans` is 2 if the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` are all met. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 2)` if the conditions are met, otherwise `b_d` is 30001**
