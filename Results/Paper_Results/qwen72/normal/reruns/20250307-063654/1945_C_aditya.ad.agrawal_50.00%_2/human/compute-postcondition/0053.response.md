The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decreased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after being decreased.

State: **`pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` was last met, `b_d` is the smallest value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` that satisfied the condition, and `t` must be greater than 0**
