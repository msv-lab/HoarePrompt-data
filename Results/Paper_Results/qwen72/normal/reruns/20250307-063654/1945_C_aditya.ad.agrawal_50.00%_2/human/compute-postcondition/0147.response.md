Output State: **`pos` is 3, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer conversion of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 elements, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `ans` is 3, `b_d` retains its original value. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is 1 and `o_l` is 2, and `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is `o - 2`. If `i` is not 0, `z_l` is 0 and `o_l` is 3, and `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is `o - 3`.**

The value of `ans` is updated to 3, which is the value of `pos`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
