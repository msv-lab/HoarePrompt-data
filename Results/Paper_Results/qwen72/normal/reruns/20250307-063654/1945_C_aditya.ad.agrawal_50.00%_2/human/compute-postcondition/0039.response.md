Postcondition: ***`arr` must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `ans` and `b_d` remain unchanged if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is not met. If the condition is met, `ans` is set to `pos`, `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and if `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.***
