To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions that define the value of `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `pos` is `n`.
- `z_l` is the number of 0s in `arr`.
- `o_l` is the number of 1s in `arr`.
- `z_r` is 0.
- `o_r` is 0.
- `ans` is the last position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were all met, or 0 if no such position exists.
- `b_d` is the smallest value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met, or 30001 if no such position exists.

### Explanation:
1. **`pos`**: This variable is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the list `arr`.
2. **`z_l`**: This is the count of 0s in the list `arr`.
3. **`o_l`**: This is the count of 1s in the list `arr`.
4. **`z_r` and `o_r`**: These are initialized to 0 and will be used to count the number of 0s and 1s in the right part of the list `arr` as `pos` decreases.
5. **`ans`**: This variable will store the last position where the conditions are met. If no such position exists, `ans` will be 0.
6. **`b_d`**: This variable will store the smallest value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions are met. If no such position exists, `b_d` will be 30001.

### Conditions:
- `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`: This condition ensures that the number of 1s in the right part of the list is at least half of the total number of elements in the right part.
- `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`: This condition ensures that the number of 0s in the left part of the list is at least half of the total number of elements in the left part.
- `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`: This condition ensures that the current position `pos` is closer to the middle of the list than any previously found position that met the other conditions.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialize `pos` to `n`**: This means `pos` starts at the end of the list `arr`.
2. **Count `z_l` and `o_l`**: These are the counts of 0s and 1s in the entire list `arr` initially.
3. **Iterate `pos` from `n` to 1**:
   - For each position `pos`, update `z_r` and `o_r` by counting the number of 0s and 1s from `pos` to the end of the list.
   - Update `z_l` and `o_l` by subtracting the number of 0s and 1s from `pos` to the end of the list.
   - Check if the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` are all met.
   - If all conditions are met, update `ans` to `pos` and update `b_d` to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.
4. **Final Value of `ans`**: After the iteration, `ans` will be the last position where all conditions were met, or 0 if no such position exists.

### Output:
Since the exact list `arr` and its length `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(ans)` statement will output the last position where the conditions were all met, or 0 if no such position exists.

Output: **ans (where ans is the last position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were all met, or 0 if no such position exists)**
