Output State: **`pos` is 1, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is `o`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer conversion of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001, `i` is the first element in `arr` and `i` is 0.**
