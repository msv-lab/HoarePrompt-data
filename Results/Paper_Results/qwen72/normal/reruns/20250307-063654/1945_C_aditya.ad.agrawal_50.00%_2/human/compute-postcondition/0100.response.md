Output State: **`pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the last position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were all met, or 0 if no such position exists, `b_d` is the smallest value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met, or 30001 if no such position exists.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `pos` will be equal to the length of the array `n`.
- The variable `z_l` will be equal to the total number of 0s in the array `arr`.
- The variable `o_l` will be equal to the total number of 1s in the array `arr`.
- The variables `z_r` and `o_r` will both be 0, as all elements have been processed.
- The variable `ans` will be the last position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were all met. If no such position exists, `ans` will remain 0.
- The variable `b_d` will be the smallest value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met. If no such position exists, `b_d` will remain 30001.
