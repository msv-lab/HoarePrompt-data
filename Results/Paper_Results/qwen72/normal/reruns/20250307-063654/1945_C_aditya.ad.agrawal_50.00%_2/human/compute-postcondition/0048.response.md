Output State: **`ans` is set to `pos`, `arr` must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `b_d` is now equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` are not checked.**

Explanation:
- `b_d` is assigned the value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.
- The values of `ans`, `arr`, `i`, and `pos` remain unchanged.
- The conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` are still not checked.
