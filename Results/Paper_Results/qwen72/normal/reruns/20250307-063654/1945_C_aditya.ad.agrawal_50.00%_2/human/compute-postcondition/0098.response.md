Output State: **`pos` is 3, `z_l` is 3 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is not 0, or 1 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is 0, or 0 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is not 0, `o_l` is 0 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is 0, or 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is not 0, or 3 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is not 0, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 3 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0 and `i` is not 0, or the number of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is 0, or the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1 if the second element of `arr` is not 0 and `i` is not 0, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 2, `ans` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 3)`**

Explanation:
- `b_d` is assigned the value `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.
- Given that `pos` is 3, `b_d` becomes `abs(n / 2 - 3)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
