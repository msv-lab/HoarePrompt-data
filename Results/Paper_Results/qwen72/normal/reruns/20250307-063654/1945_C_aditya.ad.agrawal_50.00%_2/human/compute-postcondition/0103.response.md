The loop head only contains the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero in a numerical context). At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after being decremented.

State: **`pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the last position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were all met, or 0 if no such position exists, `b_d` is the smallest value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met, or 30001 if no such position exists, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0**
