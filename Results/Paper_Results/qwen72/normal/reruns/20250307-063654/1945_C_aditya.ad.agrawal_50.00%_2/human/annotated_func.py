#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and the second line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side of the road and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        input_string = input()
        
        arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
        
        z = arr.count(0)
        
        o = arr.count(1)
        
        z_r = z
        
        o_r = o
        
        z_l = 0
        
        o_l = 0
        
        dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
        
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
            b_d = dist
        else:
            b_d = 30001
        
        for i in arr:
            pos += 1
            if i == 0:
                z_l += 1
                z_r -= 1
            else:
                o_l += 1
                o_r -= 1
            if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
                2 - pos):
                ans = pos
                b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
        
        print(ans)
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` was met for the last time, or 0 if the condition is never met, `b_d` is the smallest value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met, or 30001 if no such position exists, and `t` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes the number of houses and a string indicating the preferred side of the road for each resident ('0' for left, '1' for right). For each test case, it calculates and prints the optimal position in the string where the number of residents preferring the right side from that position to the end is at least half of the remaining residents, and the number of residents preferring the left side from the start to that position is at least half of the residents up to that point. If no such position exists, it prints 0. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` set to 0.
