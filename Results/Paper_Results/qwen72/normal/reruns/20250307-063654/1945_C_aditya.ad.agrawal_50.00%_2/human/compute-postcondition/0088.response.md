Output State: **`pos` is 2, `z_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, or 0 if the second element of `arr` is not 0, `o_l` is 0 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is not 0, or 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `ans` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 2)`**

Explanation:
- The code `b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)` updates the value of `b_d` to `abs(n / 2 - 2)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
