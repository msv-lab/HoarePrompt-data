Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the optimal position is before the first house (i.e., `0`). According to the problem description, if the entire village can be declared as the right side and still satisfy the condition, the program should output `0`. However, the current implementation does not consider this case.

**Example Case:**
```
Input:
1
3
110

Expected Output:
0

Actual Output:
3
```

In this case, the road should be laid before the first house, making the entire village the right side. Since there are 3 houses and 2 of them want to live on the right side, the condition is satisfied. However, the program outputs `3`, which is incorrect.
