Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, and the current value of `pos` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1, and the current values of `z_l` and `z_r` satisfy `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to 0, `o_l` is increased by 1, and `o_r` is decreased by 1, and the current values of `o_l` and `o_r` satisfy `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`. `ans` is equal to the current value of `pos`.**
