Output State: **`pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `t` is `t - n - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is met for the last time, or 0 if the condition is never met.**
