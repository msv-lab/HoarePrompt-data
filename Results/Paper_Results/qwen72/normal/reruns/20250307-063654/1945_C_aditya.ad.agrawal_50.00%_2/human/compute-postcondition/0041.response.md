Output State: **`arr` must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `ans` and `b_d` remain unchanged if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is not met. If the condition is met, `ans` is set to `pos`, `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and if `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- `pos` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `arr`, `i`, `ans`, `b_d`, `o_r`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `z_l`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is not evaluated by the given code snippet, so the variables `ans` and `b_d` remain unchanged.
- The specific values of `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `n` are not provided, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
