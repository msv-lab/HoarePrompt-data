Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2Â·10^4, representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` was last met, `b_d` is the smallest value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` that satisfied the condition, and `t` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the last position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were all met, or 0 if no such position exists, `b_d` is the smallest value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met, or 30001 if no such position exists, `t` is `t - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `t` is `t - n - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is met for the last time, or 0 if the condition is never met.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
