The code snippet increments the value of `pos` by 1. The initial state specifies that `arr` must have at least one element and `i` is the first element in `arr`. Since `pos` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it has some initial value, and it is incremented by 1. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1.**
