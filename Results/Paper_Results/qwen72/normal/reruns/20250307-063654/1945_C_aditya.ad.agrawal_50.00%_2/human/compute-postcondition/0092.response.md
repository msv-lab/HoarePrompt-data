Output State: **`pos` is 3, `z_l` is 3 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0, or 1 if the second element of `arr` is not 0, `o_l` is 0 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 2 if the second element of `arr` is not 0, or 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the number of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `ans` is 2 if the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` are all met. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the user input, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the characters in `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 3)` if the conditions are met, otherwise `b_d` is 30001.**

Explanation:
- `z_l` is incremented by 1.
- If the second element of `arr` is 0, `z_l` was initially 2 and is now 3.
- If the second element of `arr` is 0, `z_l` was initially 1 and is now 2.
- If the second element of `arr` is not 0, `z_l` was initially 0 and is now 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
