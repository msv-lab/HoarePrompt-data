Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is `o`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer conversion of each character in `input_string`, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`pos` is 1, `z_l` is 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is `o` if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is `o - 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer conversion of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the first element in `arr`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is 1 and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `b_d` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`pos` is 2, `z_l` is 2 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 2, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is `o` if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is `o - 2`, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer conversion of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the second element in `arr`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is 2 and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - 2)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `b_d` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `pos` is 3, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer conversion of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 elements, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `b_d` retains its original value. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is 1 and `o_l` is 2, and `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is `o - 2`. If `i` is not 0, `z_l` is 0 and `o_l` is 3, and `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is `o - 3`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is 3 and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - 3)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
