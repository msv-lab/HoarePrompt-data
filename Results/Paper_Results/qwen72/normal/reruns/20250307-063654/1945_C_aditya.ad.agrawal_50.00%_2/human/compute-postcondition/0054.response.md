Output State: **`pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` was last met, `b_d` is the smallest value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` that satisfied the condition, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**
