Output State: **`pos` is 2, `z_l` is 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 2 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is `o` if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is `o - 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer conversion of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `ans` is 0 if the conditions are not met, otherwise `ans` is 1, `b_d` retains its original value if the conditions are not met, otherwise `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 1)`.**
