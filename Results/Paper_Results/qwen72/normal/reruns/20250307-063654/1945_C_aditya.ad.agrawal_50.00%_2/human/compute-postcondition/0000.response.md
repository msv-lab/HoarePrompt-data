The code snippet reads an integer `t` from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases. The value of `t` is constrained to be between 1 and 2·10^4. The initial state specifies that `t` is expected to be within this range, and no other variables are mentioned or affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2·10^4, representing the number of test cases.**
