Output State: **`pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `t` is `t - n` and `t` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is met for the last time, or 0 if the condition is never met.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- `pos` will be equal to `n` because the loop iterates through all `n` elements of `arr`.
- `z_l` will be the total number of 0s in `arr` because every 0 encountered increments `z_l` and decrements `z_r`.
- `o_l` will be the total number of 1s in `arr` because every 1 encountered increments `o_l` and decrements `o_r`.
- `z_r` and `o_r` will both be 0 because all elements have been processed, and `z_r` and `o_r` are decremented each time a 0 or 1 is encountered, respectively.
- `t` will be `t - n` because `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, and the loop runs `n` times.
- `ans` will be the position (1-indexed) where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is met for the last time. If this condition is never met, `ans` remains 0.
