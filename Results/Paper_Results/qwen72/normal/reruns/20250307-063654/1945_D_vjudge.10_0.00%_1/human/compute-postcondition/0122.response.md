The only objects in the loop head are variables `y` and `max_p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `y` and `max_p`. The loop iterates from `max_p - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `y` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `max_p - 1`, and `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` becomes `max_p - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than `0`.

State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]`. If `y` is `1`, `a_values[0]` is added to `custo`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 1]`, and the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
