To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the loop head and the conditions:

### Loop Head:
```python
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `y`: The loop variable.
- `num_fila`: The starting point of the range.
- `max_p`: The stopping point of the range.

### Conditions:
- The loop iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `num_fila - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `y` is `num_fila - 1`.
- `a` is a list of strings with at least `len(a)` elements.
- `a_values` is a list that includes the integer values of all elements in `a` in the same order.
- `b` has at least `len(b)` elements.
- `b_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `b` in the same order.
- `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` becomes `num_fila - 2`.
- For the loop to continue, `y` must still be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

### Final State:
- `y` is `num_fila - 2`.
- `num_fila` must still be greater than or equal to `max_p` for `y` to be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

State: **`y` is `num_fila - 2`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input with at least `len(a)` elements, `a_values` is a list that includes the integer values of all elements in `a` in the same order, `b` has at least `len(b)` elements, `b_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `b` in the same order, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`**
