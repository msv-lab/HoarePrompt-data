The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, and the loop is controlled by the range defined by `x`. Since the loop has finished executing, `i` must have reached the value of `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be reset to 0, and `x` must be greater than 0.

State: **`y` is `1`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `1`, with adjustments based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` for `y` from `max_p - 1` down to `1`, and `custo` is appended to the list `custos`, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**
