Postcondition: ***`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]`. If `y` is `1`, `a_values[0]` is added to `custo`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 1]`, and the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
