Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, plus `a_values[max_p - 1]`, and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` remains `max_p - 1`.
- The value of `max_p` remains greater than or equal to `2`.
- The value of `num_fila` remains greater than `max_p`.
- The value of `custo` is updated by adding `a_values[y]` to it. Since `y` is `max_p - 1`, `custo` is now the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, plus `a_values[max_p - 1]`.
- The condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]` remains valid.
