Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem of determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first \( m \) people in the queue. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in how it calculates the cost for Kirill to move to a position \( j \) from a position \( i \).

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The expected output is `14`, but the program outputs `13`.

### Explanation of the Counterexample:
- **Initial Queue:** \( [1, 2, 3, 4] \) (where 1 is the first person, and 4 is Kirill).
- **a_values:** \( [7, 3, 6, 9] \)
- **b_values:** \( [4, 3, 8, 5] \)

Kirill wants to be among the first 2 people in the queue. The optimal way to achieve this is:
1. Move from position 4 to position 3, paying \( a_3 = 6 \) coins.
2. Move from position 3 to position 2, paying \( a_2 = 3 \) coins and \( b_3 = 8 \) coins.

Total cost: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \).

However, the program calculates the cost incorrectly:
- It first checks positions 3 and 4, and adds the minimum of \( a_3 \) and \( b_3 \) to the cost, which is \( 6 \).
- Then it checks positions 2 and 3, and adds the minimum of \( a_2 + b_3 \) and \( a_3 \) to the cost, which is \( 3 + 8 = 11 \).

Total cost calculated by the program: \( 6 + 11 = 17 \).

The program's logic is flawed, and it does not correctly handle the cost calculation for moving Kirill to the desired position. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
