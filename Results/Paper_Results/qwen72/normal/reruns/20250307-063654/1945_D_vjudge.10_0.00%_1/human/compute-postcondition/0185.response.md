Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` is greater than 1, `y` is 1, the sum of `a_values[0]` and `b_values[1]` is less than or equal to `a_values[1]`, and `custo` is increased by `a_values[0]` + `b_values[1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `y`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `custo` remain unchanged. The only impact of the code is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
