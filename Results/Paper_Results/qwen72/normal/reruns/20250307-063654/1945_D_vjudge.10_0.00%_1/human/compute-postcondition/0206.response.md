Postcondition: ***`y` is `max_p - 3`, `max_p` is greater than 2. If `a_values[max_p - 4] + b_values[max_p - 3] <= a_values[max_p - 3]`, `custo` is incremented by `b_values[max_p - 3]` and `b_values[max_p - 2]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`. In all cases, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[max_p - 3]` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
