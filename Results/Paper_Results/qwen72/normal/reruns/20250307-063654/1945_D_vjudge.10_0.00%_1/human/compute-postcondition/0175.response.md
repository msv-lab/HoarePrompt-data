The only objects in the loop head are variables `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`. The loop iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` in steps of `-1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `y` is `num_fila - 2`
- `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decreased by 1. Therefore, the new value of `y` will be `num_fila - 3`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`y` is `num_fila - 3`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input with at least `len(a)` elements, `a_values` is a list that includes the integer values of all elements in `a` in the same order, `b` has at least `len(b)` elements, `b_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `b` in the same order, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by the integer value of the element in `a_values` at index `num_fila - 3`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[num_fila - 3]`.**
