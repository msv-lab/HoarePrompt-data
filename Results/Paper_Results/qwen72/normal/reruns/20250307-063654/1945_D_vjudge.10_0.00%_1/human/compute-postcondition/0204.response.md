Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 3`, `max_p` is greater than 2, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[y]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `custo` is incremented by `a_values[y]`.
- The value of `y` remains `max_p - 3`.
- The value of `max_p` remains greater than 2.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
