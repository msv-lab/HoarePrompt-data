You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains an integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `m` (number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position for Kirill).
   - The next two lines contain `n` integers each, representing `a_values` and `b_values`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads `a_values` and `b_values` and converts them to integers.

2. **Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - The program calculates the cost in two main loops:
     - The first loop iterates from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` (inclusive) in reverse order.
     - The second loop iterates from `max_p - 1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order.

3. **First Loop:**
   - This loop iterates over the positions from `n` to `m` (exclusive).
   - It adds the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the cost `custo`.

4. **Second Loop:**
   - This loop iterates over the positions from `m - 1` to `1` (inclusive).
   - It checks if the cost to move from position `y` to position `y - 1` is less than or equal to the cost of staying at position `y`.
   - If the condition is true, it adds `b_values[y]` to the cost and continues.
   - If the condition is false, it adds `a_values[y]` to the cost and breaks the loop.
   - If the loop reaches position `1`, it adds `a_values[0]` to the cost.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **First Loop:**
   - The loop correctly calculates the cost for positions from `n` to `m` (exclusive).
   - However, it should be noted that the cost calculation here is not necessarily the minimum cost for Kirill to move to position `m`.

2. **Second Loop:**
   - The loop attempts to calculate the cost for positions from `m - 1` to `1` (inclusive).
   - The condition `if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is intended to check if it is cheaper to move to the previous position.
   - However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure the minimum cost. Kirill should be able to move to any position `j` such that `j < i` and pay `a_j` coins plus `b_k` coins for each `k` such that `j < k < i`.

3. **Overall Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to any position `j` such that `j < i` and pay the appropriate coins.
   - The program assumes a linear movement from `n` to `m` and then from `m - 1` to `1`, which is not optimal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to any position `j` such that `j < i` and pay the appropriate coins. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
