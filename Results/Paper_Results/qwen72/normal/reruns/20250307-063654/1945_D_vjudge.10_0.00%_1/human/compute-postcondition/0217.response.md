The function `func` is described with constraints but lacks explicit parameters in its definition. Based on the provided constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, possibly in the form of a list or tuple, to handle the described inputs. However, since the function signature only shows `def func()`, we will assume that the parameters are passed in a way that is not explicitly shown, such as through a global variable or a different method of input handling.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000.
- `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function's output is not explicitly described in the prompt, but based on the constraints, it is likely that the function returns some result for each test case, possibly related to the lists `a_i` and `b_i`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m`, and lists `a_i` and `b_i` of length `n`. It returns a result for each test case, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
