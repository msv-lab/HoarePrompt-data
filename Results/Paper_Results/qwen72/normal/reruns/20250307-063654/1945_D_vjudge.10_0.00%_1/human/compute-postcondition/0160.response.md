The only objects in the loop head are the variable `y` and the list `b`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop variable `y` and the list `b` are used and modified.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `y` is the last element of `b`.
- `b` must have at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `b` must still have at least one element, and `y` will be the next element in the list `b`.

Since `y` was the last element of `b` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `b` must have at least two elements. The next `y` will be the element before the last element of `b`.

State: **`y` is the second-to-last element of `b`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `a_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all elements in `a` in the same order, `b` must have at least two elements, `b_values` now includes the integer value of the last element of `a` in addition to its previous elements.**
