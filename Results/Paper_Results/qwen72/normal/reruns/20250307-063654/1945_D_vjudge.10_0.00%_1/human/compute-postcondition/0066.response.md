Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 3`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 3]`.**

Explanation:
- `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, which is `a_values[max_p - 3]` based on the initial state.
- The values of `b_values`, `b`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is not checked in this code snippet, so the additional logic for `custo` being further increased by `a_values[0]` or updated to `custo + a_values[max_p - 3]` does not apply here.
