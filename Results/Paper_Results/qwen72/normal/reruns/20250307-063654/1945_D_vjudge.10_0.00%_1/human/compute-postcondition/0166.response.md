Postcondition: **`y` is `num_fila - 1`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `a_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all elements in `a` in the same order, `b` must have at least `len(b)` elements, `b_values` now includes the integer values of all elements in `b` in the same order as they appeared in `b`, `num_fila` must be greater than or equal to `max_p`, and the integer value of the element at index `y` in `a_values` is less than the integer value of the element at index `y` in `b_values`.**
