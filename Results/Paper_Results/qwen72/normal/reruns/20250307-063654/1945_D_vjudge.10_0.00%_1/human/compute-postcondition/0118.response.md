Postcondition: ***`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`***
