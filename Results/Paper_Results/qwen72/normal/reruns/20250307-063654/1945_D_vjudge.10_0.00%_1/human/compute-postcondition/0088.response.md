Output State: **`a` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `y` is the last element in the list `a`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the current value of `custo` (which is 0), `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `b_values` is an empty list, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a_values` will contain the integer values of all the elements in the list `a`. The variable `y` will be the last element in the list `a`. The other variables (`custo`, `custos`, `i`, `x`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `nf`, `b`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
