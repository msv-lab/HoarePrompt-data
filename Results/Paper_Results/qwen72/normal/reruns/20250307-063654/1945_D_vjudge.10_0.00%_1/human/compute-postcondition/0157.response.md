Output State: **`y` is the last element of `a`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `a_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all elements in `a` in the same order.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `y` will be the last element of the list `a`.
- The list `a` must have at least as many elements as its original length.
- The list `a_values` will contain the integer values of all the elements in `a`, in the same order as they appeared in `a`.
