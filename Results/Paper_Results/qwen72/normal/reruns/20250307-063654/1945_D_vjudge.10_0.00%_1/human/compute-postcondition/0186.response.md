Postcondition: ***`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` is greater than 1, and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by `a_values[0] + b_values[1]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`.***
