The only objects in the loop head are the list `custos` and the variable `c`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `custos`. If `custos` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute one more time with `c` being the third element of `custos`.

At the end of the last iteration, `custos` must be a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, and `c` is the second element of `custos`. For the loop to execute one more time, `custos` must have at least 3 elements, and `c` will be the third element of `custos`.

State: **`custos` must be a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element of `custos`**
