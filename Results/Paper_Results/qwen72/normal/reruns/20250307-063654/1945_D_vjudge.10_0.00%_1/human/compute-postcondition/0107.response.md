Output State: **`y` is `num_fila - 3`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`, and `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`.** 

The value of `y` remains `num_fila - 3`, and `num_fila` is still greater than `max_p`. The condition that `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1` also remains valid. The value of `custo` is now increased by the value at index `y` in the list `a_values`.
