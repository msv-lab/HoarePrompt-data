Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is 1. `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `max_p - 1` down to 1, and if the sum of `a_values[0]` and `b_values[1]` is less than or equal to `a_values[1]`, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `y = max_p - 1` down to `y = 1`.
- For each iteration, if the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is true, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`.
- If `y` reaches 1 and the condition `a_values[0] + b_values[1] <= a_values[1]` is true, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`, and the loop breaks.
- If the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]` is true at any point, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, and the loop breaks.
- After all iterations, `y` will be 1, and `custo` will have been updated based on the conditions described above.
