The only objects in the loop head are variables `y` and `max_p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop iterates from `max_p - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `y` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `max_p - 1` and `max_p` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be decremented by 1, so `y` will be `max_p - 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than 0. Therefore, `max_p` must still be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 2`.**
