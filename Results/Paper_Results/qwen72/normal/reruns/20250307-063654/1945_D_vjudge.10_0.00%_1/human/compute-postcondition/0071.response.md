The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `x` must be greater than 2.

State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `max_p - 1` down to 1, and if the sum of `a_values[0]` and `b_values[1]` is less than or equal to `a_values[1]`, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`. `custos` is a list containing the current value of `custo`, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 2**
