The value of `custo` is incremented by the value at index `y` in the list `a_values`. The value of `y` is `num_fila - 2`, and `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[num_fila - 2]`.**
