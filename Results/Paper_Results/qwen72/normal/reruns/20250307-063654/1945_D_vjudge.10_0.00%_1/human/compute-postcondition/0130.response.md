The only variables in the loop head are `y`, `max_p`. The loop is iterating in reverse, starting from `max_p - 1` down to `1` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, and `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be decremented by 1, so `y` will be `max_p - 3`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than `0`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`y` is `max_p - 3`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 3]`. If `y` is 1, `a_values[0]` is added to `custo` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 3]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
