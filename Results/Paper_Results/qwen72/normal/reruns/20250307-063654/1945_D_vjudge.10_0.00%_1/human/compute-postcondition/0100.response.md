Output State: **`y` is `num_fila - 1`, `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p`, `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`.** 

The value of `custo` is incremented by the value of `b_values[y]`. The values of `y`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values[y]`, and `b_values[y]` remain unchanged, but `custo` now holds a value that is `b_values[y]` more than its previous value.
