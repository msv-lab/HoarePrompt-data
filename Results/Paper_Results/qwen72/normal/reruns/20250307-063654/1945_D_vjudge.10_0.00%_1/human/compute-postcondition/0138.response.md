Output State: **The loop has finished executing, `y` is `1`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `1`. If the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` was true for any `y` from `max_p - 1` down to `1`, `custo` includes the corresponding `b_values[y]` for those `y` values. If `y` reached `1` and the condition was true, `a_values[0]` is also added to `custo`. If the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]` was true for any `y`, `custo` includes the corresponding `a_values[y]` and the loop breaks at that point.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `y` has reached `1`.
- The initial conditions for `max_p` and `num_fila` remain unchanged.
- The variable `custo` has been updated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `1`. Additionally, if the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` was true for any `y` from `max_p - 1` down to `1`, the corresponding `b_values[y]` was added to `custo`. If `y` reached `1` and the condition was true, `a_values[0]` was also added to `custo`. If the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]` was true for any `y`, the corresponding `a_values[y]` was added to `custo`, and the loop broke at that point.
