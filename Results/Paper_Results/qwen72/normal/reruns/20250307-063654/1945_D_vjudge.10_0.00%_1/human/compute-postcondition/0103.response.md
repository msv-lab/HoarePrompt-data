Output State: **`y` is `num_fila - 2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`, `custo` is `custo + a_values[num_fila - 2]`**

Explanation: The value of `custo` is updated by adding the value at index `y` in the list `a_values`. Since `y` is `num_fila - 2` and `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
