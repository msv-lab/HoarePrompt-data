Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 1` and is currently 1, `custo` is increased by `a_values[0]` + `b_values[y]`, and the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`.**

Explanation:
- `custo` was initially increased by `b_values[y]`.
- The code snippet `custo += a_values[0]` further increases `custo` by the value of `a_values[0]`.
- Therefore, `custo` is now increased by the sum of `a_values[0]` and `b_values[y]`.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
