Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` is greater than 2, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2]`.** 

In natural language: The value of `y` remains `max_p - 2`, and `max_p` is still greater than 2. The variable `custo` is updated by adding the value of `b_values` at the index `max_p - 2` to its current value.
