Output State: **`custos` must be a non-empty list with all elements printed, and the loop has finished executing all iterations.**

In natural language, this means that the list `custos` contains all the final values of `custo` for each iteration, and the loop has completed printing each of these values. The loop has executed as many times as there are elements in the `custos` list, and all elements have been printed to the console. The state of any other variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged.
