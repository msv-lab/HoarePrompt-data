You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and m are integers for each test case where 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, a_i and b_i are lists of integers of length n where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    custos = []
    for i in range(x):
        custo = 0
        
        num_fila = 0
        
        max_p = 0
        
        a_values = []
        
        b_values = []
        
        nf = input().split()

        max_p = int(nf[1])
        
        a = input().split()
        
        b = input().split()
        
        for y in a:
            a_values.append(int(y))
        
        for y in b:
            b_values.append(int(y))
        
        for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
            if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
                custo += a_values[y]
            else:
                custo += b_values[y]
        
        for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
            if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
                custo += b_values[y]
                if y == 1:
                    custo += a_values[0]
                    break
            else:
                custo += a_values[y]
                break
        
        custos.append(custo)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `x` iterations. `custos` is a list containing the final values of `custo` for each iteration, where each `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `1`, with adjustments based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` for `y` from `max_p - 1` down to `1`. The variables `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `custo` are reset and re-evaluated for each iteration, and their final values after the last iteration are not retained.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: `custos` must be a non-empty list with all elements printed, and the loop has finished executing all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m`, and lists `a_i` and `b_i` of length `n`. It returns a result for each test case, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
