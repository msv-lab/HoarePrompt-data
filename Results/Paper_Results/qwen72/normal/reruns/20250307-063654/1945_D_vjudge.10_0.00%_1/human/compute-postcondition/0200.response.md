Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 3`, `max_p` is greater than 2, `custo` is incremented by `b_values[max_p - 3]` and `b_values[max_p - 2]` if `a_values[max_p - 4] + b_values[max_p - 3] <= a_values[max_p - 3]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[max_p - 2]` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` remains `max_p - 3`.
- The value of `max_p` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]`, which is `b_values[max_p - 3]`.
- The condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` translates to `a_values[max_p - 4] + b_values[max_p - 3] <= a_values[max_p - 3]`.
- If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[max_p - 2]` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
