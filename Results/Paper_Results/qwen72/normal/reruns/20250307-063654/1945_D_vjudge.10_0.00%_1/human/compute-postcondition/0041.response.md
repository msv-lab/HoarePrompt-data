Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `y` is `max_p - 1`. The variable `custo` is increased by the minimum value between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `y` will be `max_p - 1`, and the variable `custo` will have been incremented by the smaller of the corresponding values in `a_values` and `b_values` for each index `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`. The lists `b_values` and `b` remain unchanged, and the condition that `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p` still holds.
