The loop head contains the variables `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`. The loop iterates in reverse, starting from `num_fila - 1` and decrementing `y` by 1 until `y` is less than `max_p - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `b_values` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements.
- `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`.
- `y` is `num_fila - 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `y` must be decremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

Given that `y` is `num_fila - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `y` will be `num_fila - 3`.

State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `y` is `num_fila - 3`.**
