Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` is greater than 2, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[max_p - 2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of `y`, `max_p`, and `custo` remain unchanged, but the execution of the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
