Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, plus `a_values[max_p - 1]`, and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `y`, `max_p`, `num_fila`, and `custo` remain unchanged. The condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]` also remains valid. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
