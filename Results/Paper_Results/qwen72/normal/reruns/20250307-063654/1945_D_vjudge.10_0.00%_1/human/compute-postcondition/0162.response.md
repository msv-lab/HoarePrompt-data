The only objects in the loop head are the variable `y` and the list `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If `b` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is the second-to-last element of `b`, and `b` must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must have at least three elements, and `y` will be the last element of `b`.

State: **`y` is the last element of `b`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `len(a)` elements, `a_values` is a list that now includes the integer values of all elements in `a` in the same order, `b` must have at least three elements, `b_values` now includes the integer value of the last element of `a` and the integer value of the second-to-last and last elements of `b` in addition to its previous elements.**
