The code `b_values.append(int(y))` appends the integer value of `y` to the list `b_values`. Since `y` is the second element in the list `b`, and `b_values` already contains the integer value of `y`, this operation will add the same integer value of `y` to `b_values` again. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `y` is the second element in the list `b`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the current value of `custo` (which is 0), `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y` appended twice, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements.**
