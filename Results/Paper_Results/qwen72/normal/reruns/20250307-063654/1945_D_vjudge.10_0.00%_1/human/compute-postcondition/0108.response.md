Output State: **`y` is `num_fila - 3`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`**. 

The value of `y` remains `num_fila - 3`, and `num_fila` is still greater than `max_p`. The condition that `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1` is still valid. The variable `custo` is updated by adding the value of `b_values[y]` to its current value.
