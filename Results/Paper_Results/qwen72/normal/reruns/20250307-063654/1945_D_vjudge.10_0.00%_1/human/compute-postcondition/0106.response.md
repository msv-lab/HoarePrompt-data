The only variables in the loop head are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` with a step of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

- `y` was `num_fila - 2` at the end of the last iteration.
- Decrementing `y` by 1 gives `y = num_fila - 3`.
- For the loop to execute again, `num_fila - 3` must be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`y` is `num_fila - 3`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.**
