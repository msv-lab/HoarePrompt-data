The only objects in the loop head are the variable `y` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `y` was the first element of `a`, and `a` had at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `y` will be the second element of `a`.

State: **`y` is the second element of `a`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `a_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first element of `a` as its last element.**
