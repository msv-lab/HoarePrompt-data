Output State: **`b_values` is an empty list, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `y` is 1, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the current value of `custo`, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 2, `a_values` is an empty list, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

The code `b = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `b` must have at least `n` elements, as specified in the initial state.
