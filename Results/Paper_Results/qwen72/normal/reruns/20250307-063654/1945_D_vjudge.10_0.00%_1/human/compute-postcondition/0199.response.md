The only objects in the loop head are variables `y` and `max_p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `y` and `max_p`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `y` is `max_p - 2`
- `max_p` is greater than 2

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, and the loop will continue as long as `y` is greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `y` will be `max_p - 3`
- `max_p` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to potentially execute again.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`y` is `max_p - 3`, `max_p` is greater than 2, and `custo` is incremented by `b_values[max_p - 2]` if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[max_p - 2]` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
