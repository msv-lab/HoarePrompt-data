The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y`, `max_p`, and the range parameters. The loop is set to iterate from `max_p - 1` down to `0` (exclusive) in steps of `-1`. For the loop to execute, `max_p - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`, and `y` must start at `max_p - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `y` is `max_p - 1`
- `a` is a list of strings with at least `len(a)` elements
- `a_values` is a list of integer values corresponding to `a`
- `b` has at least `len(b)` elements
- `b_values` includes the integer values corresponding to `b`
- `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`

We need to ensure that `max_p` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `y` is already set to `max_p - 1`, which is correct for the loop to start.

State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` must be greater than 1**
