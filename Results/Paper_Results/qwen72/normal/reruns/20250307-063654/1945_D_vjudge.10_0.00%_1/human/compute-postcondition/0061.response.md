The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and `max_p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `max_p - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `y` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `max_p - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1 to `max_p - 3`, and `max_p` must still be at least 2 to ensure that `y` is within the valid range.

State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 3`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 3]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`, `custo` is updated to `custo + a_values[max_p - 3]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
