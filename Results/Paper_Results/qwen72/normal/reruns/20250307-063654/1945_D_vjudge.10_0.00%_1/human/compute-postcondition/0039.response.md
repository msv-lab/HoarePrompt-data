The value of `custo` is incremented by the value of `b_values[y]`. The value of `y` is `num_fila - 3`, and `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`. The other variables (`b_values`, `b`, `num_fila`, `max_p`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[num_fila - 3]`.
