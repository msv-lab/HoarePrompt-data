Output State: **The loop has finished executing all `x` iterations. `custos` is a list containing the final values of `custo` for each iteration, where each `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `1`, with adjustments based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` for `y` from `max_p - 1` down to `1`. The variables `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `custo` are reset and re-evaluated for each iteration, and their final values after the last iteration are not retained.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all `x` iterations, the list `custos` will contain the final calculated costs for each test case. The values of `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `custo` are reset and re-evaluated for each iteration, so their final values after the last iteration are not retained. The list `custos` will have `x` elements, each representing the cost calculated for the corresponding test case based on the given conditions.
