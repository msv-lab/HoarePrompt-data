Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has finished executing all `x` iterations. `custos` is a list containing the final values of `custo` for each iteration, where each `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `1`, with adjustments based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` for `y` from `max_p - 1` down to `1`. The variables `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `custo` are reset and re-evaluated for each iteration, and their final values after the last iteration are not retained.
Code of the loop:
for c in custos:
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `custos` must be a non-empty list, `c` is the first element of `custos`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `custos` must be a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element of `custos`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `custos` must be a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element of `custos`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
