The only objects in the loop head are the list `a` and the variable `y`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `y` will be the third element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element in the list `a`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `a` and the integer value of the second element of `a`**
