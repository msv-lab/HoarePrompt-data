Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers for each test case where 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `x` must be greater than 0; `custos` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `custo` is 0; `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`; `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`; `a_values` is an empty list; `b_values` is an empty list; `nf` is a list of strings; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for y in a:
    a_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers for each test case where 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `x` must be greater than 0; `custos` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `custo` is 0; `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`; `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`; `a_values` is a list containing one integer, which is the integer value of `y`; `b_values` is an empty list; `nf` is a list of strings; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers for each test case where 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `x` must be greater than 0; `custos` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `custo` is 0; `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`; `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`; `a_values` is a list containing two integers, the first integer is the integer value of `y` and the second integer is also the integer value of `y`; `b_values` is an empty list; `nf` is a list of strings; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least two elements; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `y` is the second element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers for each test case where 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `x` must be greater than 0; `custos` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `custo` is 0; `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`; `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`; `a_values` is a list containing three integers, all equal to the integer value of `y`; `b_values` is an empty list; `nf` is a list of strings; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least three elements; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `y` is the third element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
