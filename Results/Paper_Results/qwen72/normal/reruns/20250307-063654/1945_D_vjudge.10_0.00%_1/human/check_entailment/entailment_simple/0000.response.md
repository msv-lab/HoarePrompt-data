### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads the `a_values` and `b_values` lists from the input and converts them to integers.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a variable `custo` to 0 for each test case.
   - It iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, adding the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to `custo`. This part of the logic is intended to calculate the cost of moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - After that, it iterates from `max_p - 1` down to 1, checking if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`. If true, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo` and, if `y` is 1, also adds `a_values[0]` to `custo`. If false, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo` and breaks the loop.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results stored in the `custos` list.

### Issues and Analysis:

1. **Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic in the first loop (`for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`) is correct for calculating the cost of moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions. It ensures that Kirill pays the minimum cost to move to a position `j` where `j < i`.
   - However, the second loop (`for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1)`) has a logical issue. The condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is not necessarily the correct way to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position `j` where `j < i`. This condition only checks if the sum of the cost to move to the previous position and the cost to move to the current position is less than or equal to the cost to move directly to the current position. It does not account for the possibility of moving to an intermediate position that might be cheaper.

2. **Breaking the Loop:**
   - The loop breaks after the first false condition, which may not always result in the minimum cost. Kirill might need to consider multiple positions to find the optimal path.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `m` is 1 or when `n` is very small. For example, when `m` is 1, Kirill should always move to the first position, and the cost should be the minimum of `a_values[0]` and `b_values[0]`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed, particularly in the second loop where it does not correctly account for all possible moves Kirill can make to minimize the cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
