To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and expressions in the loop head: `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`.

1. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop starts with `y` set to `num_fila - 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.
   - The loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `y` is the last element in the list `b`.
   - `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`.
   - `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `num_fila - 1` must be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.
   - This implies that `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p`.

4. **Final State**:
   - `y` should be set to `num_fila - 1` before the loop starts.
   - `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`y` is `num_fila - 1`, `num_fila` must be greater than `max_p`**
