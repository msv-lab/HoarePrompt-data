Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 3`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 3]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]`.
- `y` is defined as `max_p - 3`, so `custo` is incremented by `b_values[max_p - 3]`.
- The states of the other variables (`b_values`, `b`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions in the initial state are still valid.
