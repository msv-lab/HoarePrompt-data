Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers for each test case where 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `x` must be greater than 0; `custos` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `custo` is 0; `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`; `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`; `a_values` is a list containing one integer, which is the integer value of `y`; `b_values` is an empty list; `nf` is a list of strings; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
