The only objects in the loop head are the variable `y` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least one more element after the current `y`.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is the second element of `a`, and `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least three elements, and `y` will be the third element of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers for each test case where 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `x` must be greater than 0; `custos` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `custo` is 0; `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`; `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`; `a_values` is a list containing two integers, the first integer is the integer value of `y` and the second integer is also the integer value of `y`; `b_values` is an empty list; `nf` is a list of strings; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input and must have at least three elements; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `y` is the third element of `a`.**
