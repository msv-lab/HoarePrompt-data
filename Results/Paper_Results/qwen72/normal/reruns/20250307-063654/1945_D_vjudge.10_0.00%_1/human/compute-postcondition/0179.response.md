Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input with at least `len(a)` elements, `a_values` is a list that includes the integer values of all elements in `a` in the same order, `b` has at least `len(b)` elements, `b_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `b` in the same order, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`. The variable `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p` (inclusive).**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `y` will have the value `max_p - 1`. The lists `a` and `b` will remain unchanged, as will their corresponding integer value lists `a_values` and `b_values`. The variable `custo` will have been incremented by the sum of the smaller values between the corresponding elements in `a_values` and `b_values` for each index `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`.
