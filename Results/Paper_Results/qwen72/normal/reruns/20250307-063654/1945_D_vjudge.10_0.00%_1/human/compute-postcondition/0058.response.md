Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `custo` is updated to `custo + a_values[max_p - 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `custo` is incremented by the value at the index `y` in the list `a_values`.
- Since `y` is defined as `max_p - 2`, the new value of `custo` is `custo + a_values[max_p - 2]`.
- All other variables (`b_values`, `b`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
