The `print(c)` statement will print the third element of the list `custos`.

Based on the initial state, `custos` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements. The variable `c` is defined as the third element of this list. Therefore, when the `print(c)` statement is executed, it will output the value of the third element in the list `custos`.

Output: **c (where c is the third element of the list `custos`)**
