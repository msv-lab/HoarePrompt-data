The only objects in the loop head are variables `y` and `max_p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y` and `max_p`. The loop decrements `y` by 1 each time and continues as long as `y` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is `max_p - 1` and `max_p` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` becomes `max_p - 2`. The loop will continue to execute if `y` is still greater than 0, which means `max_p - 2` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `max_p` must be greater than 2.

State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` is greater than 2.**
