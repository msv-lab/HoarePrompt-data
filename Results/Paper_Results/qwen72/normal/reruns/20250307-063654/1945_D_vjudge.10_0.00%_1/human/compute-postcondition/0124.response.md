Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, plus `b_values[max_p - 2]`, and `a_values[0]` has been added to `custo`.**
