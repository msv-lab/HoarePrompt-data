Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[num_fila - 3]`.**

The value of `custo` is incremented by the value at the index `y` in the list `a_values`. Since `y` is `num_fila - 3`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[num_fila - 3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
