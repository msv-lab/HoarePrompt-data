Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `y` will have the value `max_p - 1`, which is the last value it takes in the loop. The variable `num_fila` remains greater than `max_p`, as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `custo` will be the sum of the minimum values between the corresponding elements of `a_values` and `b_values` for each index `y` starting from `num_fila - 1` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches `max_p - 1`. The other variables (`a`, `a_values`, `b`, `b_values`, `custos`, `i`, `x`, `nf`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
