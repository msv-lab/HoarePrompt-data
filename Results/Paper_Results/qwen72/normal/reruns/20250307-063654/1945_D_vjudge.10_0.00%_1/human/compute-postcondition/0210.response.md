To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `c` and the list `custos`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- The loop has finished executing all `x` iterations.
- `custos` is a list containing the final values of `custo` for each iteration.
- `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `custo` are reset and re-evaluated for each iteration, and their final values after the last iteration are not retained.

For the loop to execute, the list `custos` must contain at least one element. If `custos` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `custos` is not empty.

State: **`custos` must be a non-empty list, `c` is the first element of `custos`**
