Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` is greater than 2, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2] + a_values[0]`.** 

The value of `custo` is updated by adding `a_values[0]` to its previous value, which was already increased by `b_values[max_p - 2]`. The values of `y` and `max_p` remain unchanged.
