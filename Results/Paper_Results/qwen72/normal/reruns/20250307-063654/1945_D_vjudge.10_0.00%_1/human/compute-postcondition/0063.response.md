Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 3`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 3] + a_values[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[0]` increases the value of `custo` by the first element in the list `a_values`. The initial state specifies that `custo` was already increased by `b_values[max_p - 3]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `custo` is now increased by the sum of `b_values[max_p - 3]` and `a_values[0]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
