To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `y`, `max_p`, and the range parameters. The loop is defined as `for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):`, which means `y` will start at `max_p - 1` and decrement by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive).

Let's break down the requirements:
1. **`y`**: The loop starts with `y` set to `max_p - 1`.
2. **`max_p`**: The loop will execute if `max_p - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `max_p` must be at least 2.
3. **Range Parameters**: The loop will iterate from `max_p - 1` down to 1, so `max_p - 1` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `b_values` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements.
- `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`.
- `y` is `max_p - 1`.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The key adjustments are:
- `max_p` must be at least 2.
- `y` must start at `max_p - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 1`**
