Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` is greater than 1, `y` is 1, the sum of `a_values[0]` and `b_values[1]` is less than or equal to `a_values[1]`, and `custo` is increased by `a_values[0]` + `b_values[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `custo` is increased by `a_values[0]`, so the new value of `custo` is the original value of `custo` plus `a_values[0]`.
- Since `custo` was already increased by `b_values[1]` in the initial state, the total increase in `custo` is `a_values[0]` + `b_values[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
