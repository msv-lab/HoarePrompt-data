The code snippet `custo += a_values[y]` impacts the variable `custo` by increasing its value by the integer value of the element in `a_values` at index `y`. Given that `y` is `num_fila - 3`, the value of `custo` is increased by `a_values[num_fila - 3]`.

Output State: **`y` is `num_fila - 3`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input with at least `len(a)` elements, `a_values` is a list that includes the integer values of all elements in `a` in the same order, `b` has at least `len(b)` elements, `b_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `b` in the same order, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[num_fila - 3]`.**
