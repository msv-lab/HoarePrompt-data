The only objects in the loop head are the list `custos` and the variable `c`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `custos` must still be non-empty, and `c` must be the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `custos` is a non-empty list, and `c` is the first element of `custos`. For the loop to execute again, `custos` must still be non-empty, and `c` must now be the second element of `custos`.

State: **`custos` must be a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `c` is the second element of `custos`**
