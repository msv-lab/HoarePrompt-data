The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and the list `b`. The loop iterates over each element in `b`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `b` must be assigned to `y`, and `b` must have at least one more element.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is the first element in the list `b`, and `b` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be the second element in the list `b`, and `b` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`a` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `a_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `a`, `y` is the second element in the list `b`, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the current value of `custo` (which is 0), `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2, `b_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y`, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is `int(nf[1])`, `nf` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements.**
