### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads the `a_values` and `b_values` lists, converting them to integers.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `custo` to 0 for each test case.
   - It iterates from the end of the queue (`num_fila - 1`) to the position `max_p` (inclusive) and adds the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to `custo`.
   - After that, it iterates from `max_p - 1` down to 1 and checks if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`. If true, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo` and, if `y` is 1, it also adds `a_values[0]` to `custo`. If false, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo` and breaks the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - The function appends the calculated `custo` to the list `custos`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `custos`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
  - The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. Specifically, the second loop does not correctly handle the condition for moving Kirill to the desired position. The condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is not sufficient to determine the optimal cost for moving Kirill to the position `y`.
  - The function should consider the cumulative cost of moving Kirill to the desired position, not just the immediate cost for each step.

### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a priority queue, to keep track of the minimum cost for Kirill to move to each position from the end of the queue to the desired position `m`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach the desired position in the queue. The logic for determining the cost is flawed and does not handle the problem constraints correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**
