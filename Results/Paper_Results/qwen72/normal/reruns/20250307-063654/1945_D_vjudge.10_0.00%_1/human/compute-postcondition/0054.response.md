Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `custo` is updated by adding the value at the index `y` in the list `b_values`.
- Since `y` is defined as `max_p - 2`, the value at `b_values[max_p - 2]` is added to `custo`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
