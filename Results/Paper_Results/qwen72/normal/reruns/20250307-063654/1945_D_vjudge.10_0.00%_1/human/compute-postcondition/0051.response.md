Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 1`, the sum of `a_values[y - 1]` and `b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, and `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
