To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:
```
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
```
This loop will iterate over values of `y` starting from `max_p - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of `y` must be greater than or equal to the ending value of `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `y` is `max_p - 1`
- `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`
- `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`

We need to ensure that `max_p - 1` is greater than or equal to `1` for the loop to execute. This means `max_p` must be at least `2`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `y` should be `max_p - 1` (which is the starting value of the loop)
- `max_p` must be greater than or equal to `2` (to ensure the loop starts and runs at least once)
- `custo` remains as it is, since it is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` must be greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`**
