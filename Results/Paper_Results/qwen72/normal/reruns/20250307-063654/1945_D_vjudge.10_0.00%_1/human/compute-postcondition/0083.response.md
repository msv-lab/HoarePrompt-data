The code snippet `a_values.append(int(y))` appends the integer conversion of `y` to the list `a_values`. However, the initial state only mentions `a` as a list of strings obtained from the input with at least one element, and does not provide information about `a_values` or `y`. Therefore, we can only infer that `a_values` is a list and `y` is a variable that can be converted to an integer. The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of `y` appended to it.**
