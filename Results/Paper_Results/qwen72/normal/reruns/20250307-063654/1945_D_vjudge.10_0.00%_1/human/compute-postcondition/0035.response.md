Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, `custo` is increased by the value at index `y` in `b_values`.**

Explanation: The value of `custo` is incremented by the integer value located at the index `y` in the list `b_values`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
