The only objects in the loop head are the list `b` and the variable `y`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `b`. If `b` has at least two elements, the loop will execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `b` must have at least one element, `y` is the first element in `b`, and `b_values` includes the integer value of `y` as its last element. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must have at least two elements, and `y` will be the second element in `b`.

State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least two elements, `y` is the second element in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first element of `b` as its last element.**
