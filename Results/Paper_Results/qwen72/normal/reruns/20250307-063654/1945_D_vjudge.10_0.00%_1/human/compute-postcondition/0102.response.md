The only variables in the loop head are `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y` and the values of `num_fila` and `max_p`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `y` is `num_fila - 1`
- `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`

The loop is iterating in reverse, starting from `num_fila - 1` and going down to `max_p - 1` (inclusive), with a step of `-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decreased by 1, and it must still be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `y` will be `num_fila - 2`
- `num_fila` is still greater than `max_p`
- `y` must be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`y` is `num_fila - 2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `y` must be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`**
