The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `num_fila` (number of elements in lists `a` and `b`), and an integer `max_p` (a position in the lists). The function reads these values and the lists `a` and `b` from standard input. For each test case, it calculates a cost by summing the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `1`, with additional adjustments based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` for `y` from `max_p - 1` down to `1`. The function then prints the calculated cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the list `custos` contains the final cost for each test case, and all elements of `custos` are printed. The function does not return any value.
