The only object in the loop head is the list `b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `b`. If the list `b` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input, but it does not specify that `b` must have at least one element. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `b` must have at least one element.

State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least one element, `y` is the first element in `b`**
