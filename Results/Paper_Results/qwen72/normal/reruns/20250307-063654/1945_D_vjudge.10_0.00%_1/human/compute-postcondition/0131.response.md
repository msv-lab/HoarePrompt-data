Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 3`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`, plus `b_values[max_p - 3]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is `max_p - 3`.
- The value of `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`.
- The value of `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`.
- The value of `custo` was initially the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`.
- After executing `custo += b_values[y]`, `custo` is updated to include `b_values[max_p - 3]` (since `y` is `max_p - 3`).
- The states of `y`, `max_p`, and `num_fila` remain unchanged.
