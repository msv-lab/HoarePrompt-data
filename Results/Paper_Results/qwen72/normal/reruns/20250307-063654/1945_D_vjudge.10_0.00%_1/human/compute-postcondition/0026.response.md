Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, where each integer is the integer value of the corresponding element in `b`, and `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `b_values` will contain the integer values of all the elements in the list `b`. The list `b` must have had at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of the list `b`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, `b_i`, `custos`, `i`, `custo`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `nf`, `a`) remain unchanged.
