Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2]` and `a_values[0]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `custo += a_values[0]` increases the value of `custo` by the value of the first element in the list `a_values`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `custo` is the sum of its previous value and `a_values[0]`, in addition to the value `b_values[max_p - 2]` that was already added to it.
