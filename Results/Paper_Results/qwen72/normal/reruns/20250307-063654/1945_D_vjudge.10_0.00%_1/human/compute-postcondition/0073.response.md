Output State: **`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is 0, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the current value of `custo`, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 2**

The value of `num_fila` is set to 0, overriding its previous value which was greater than or equal to `max_p`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
