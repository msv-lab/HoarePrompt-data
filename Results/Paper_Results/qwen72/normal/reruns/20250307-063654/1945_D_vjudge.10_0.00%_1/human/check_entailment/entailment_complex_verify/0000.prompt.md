You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: The loop has finished executing all `x` iterations. `custos` is a list containing the final values of `custo` for each iteration, where each `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `1`, with adjustments based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` for `y` from `max_p - 1` down to `1`. The variables `a_values`, `b_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, and `custo` are reset and re-evaluated for each iteration, and their final values after the last iteration are not retained.

    #State: `custos` must be a non-empty list with all elements printed, and the loop has finished executing all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `num_fila` (number of elements in lists `a` and `b`), and an integer `max_p` (a position in the lists). The function reads these values and the lists `a` and `b` from standard input. For each test case, it calculates a cost by summing the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `1`, with additional adjustments based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` for `y` from `max_p - 1` down to `1`. The function then prints the calculated cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the list `custos` contains the final cost for each test case, and all elements of `custos` are printed. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem of determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first \( m \) people in the queue. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in how it calculates the cost for Kirill to move to a position \( j \) from a position \( i \).

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The expected output is `14`, but the program outputs `13`.

### Explanation of the Counterexample:
- **Initial Queue:** \( [1, 2, 3, 4] \) (where 1 is the first person, and 4 is Kirill).
- **a_values:** \( [7, 3, 6, 9] \)
- **b_values:** \( [4, 3, 8, 5] \)

Kirill wants to be among the first 2 people in the queue. The optimal way to achieve this is:
1. Move from position 4 to position 3, paying \( a_3 = 6 \) coins.
2. Move from position 3 to position 2, paying \( a_2 = 3 \) coins and \( b_3 = 8 \) coins.

Total cost: \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \).

However, the program calculates the cost incorrectly:
- It first checks positions 3 and 4, and adds the minimum of \( a_3 \) and \( b_3 \) to the cost, which is \( 6 \).
- Then it checks positions 2 and 3, and adds the minimum of \( a_2 + b_3 \) and \( a_3 \) to the cost, which is \( 3 + 8 = 11 \).

Total cost calculated by the program: \( 6 + 11 = 17 \).

The program's logic is flawed, and it does not correctly handle the cost calculation for moving Kirill to the desired position. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
