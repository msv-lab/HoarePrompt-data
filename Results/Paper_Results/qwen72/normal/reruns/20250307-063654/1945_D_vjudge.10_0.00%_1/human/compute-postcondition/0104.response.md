Output State: **`y` is `num_fila - 2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `y` must be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`**. 

The value of `custo` is updated by adding the value at index `y` in the list `b_values`. The values of `y`, `num_fila`, and `max_p` remain unchanged.
