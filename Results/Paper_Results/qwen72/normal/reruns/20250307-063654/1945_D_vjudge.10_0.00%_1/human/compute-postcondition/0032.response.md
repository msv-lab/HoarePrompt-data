Postcondition: ***`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `y` is `num_fila - 1`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`.***
