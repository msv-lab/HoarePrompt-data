Postcondition: ***`y` is `num_fila - 3`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input with at least `len(a)` elements, `a_values` is a list that includes the integer values of all elements in `a` in the same order, `b` has at least `len(b)` elements, `b_values` includes the integer values of all elements in `b` in the same order, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`. If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[num_fila - 3]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by `b_values[num_fila - 3]`.***
