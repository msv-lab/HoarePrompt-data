Output State: **`y` is `0`, `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `max_p - 1` to `1` (inclusive), and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `y` will be `0` because the loop decrements `y` from `max_p - 1` to `1`. The variable `custo` will be incremented by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `max_p - 1` to `1` (inclusive), based on the conditions specified in the loop. If at any point `y` becomes `1` and the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is met, `custo` will be further increased by `a_values[0]` and the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement as soon as the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]` is met.
