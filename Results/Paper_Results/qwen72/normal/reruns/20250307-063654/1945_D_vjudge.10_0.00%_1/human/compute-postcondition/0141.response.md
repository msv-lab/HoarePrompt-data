Output State: **`y` is `1`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `custo` is `0`, `custos` contains the previous `custo` value, `i` is `0`, `x` must be greater than `0`**

Explanation:
- The variable `custo` is reset to `0`.
- The initial state indicates that `custo` was previously the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `1`, with adjustments based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` for `y` from `max_p - 1` down to `1`.
- The previous `custo` value was appended to the list `custos`.
- The values of `y`, `max_p`, `num_fila`, `i`, and the condition that `x` must be greater than `0` remain unchanged.
