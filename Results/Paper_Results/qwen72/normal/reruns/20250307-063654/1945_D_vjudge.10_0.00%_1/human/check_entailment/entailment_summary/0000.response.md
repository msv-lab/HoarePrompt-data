Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - It starts by iterating from the end of the queue (`num_fila - 1`) to the `max_p` position, adding the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the cost.
   - Then, it iterates from `max_p - 1` to the beginning of the queue, adjusting the cost based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is used to decide whether Kirill should pay `b_values[y]` to move past the person at position `y` or pay `a_values[y]` to move directly to position `y`.
   - If the condition is met, it adds `b_values[y]` to the cost and checks if `y` is 1, in which case it adds `a_values[0]` to the cost.
   - If the condition is not met, it adds `a_values[y]` to the cost and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly appends the calculated cost to the `custos` list and prints each cost after processing all test cases.

However, there are a few issues with the logic and the approach:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the cost calculation for moving Kirill to the desired position. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum cost to move Kirill from position `i` to position `j` is flawed.
   - The program should consider the total cost of moving Kirill to each possible position from `i` to `j` and choose the minimum cost.

2. **Logic for Moving**:
   - The program should use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - The current logic does not account for the cumulative cost of moving through multiple positions.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `m` is 1 or `n` is 1 correctly. For example, if `m` is 1, Kirill should only consider the cost to move to the first position, which is `a_values[0]`.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
