Postcondition: ***`y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` is greater than 2, and `custo` is incremented by `b_values[max_p - 2]` if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[max_p - 2]` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
