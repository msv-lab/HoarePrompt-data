The only objects in the loop head are the list `b` and the variable `y`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `b`. If `b` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute one more time for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `b` had at least 2 elements, `y` was the second element in `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must have at least 3 elements, and `y` will be the third element in `b`.

State: **`b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first element of `b` and the integer value of the second element of `b` as its last elements.**
