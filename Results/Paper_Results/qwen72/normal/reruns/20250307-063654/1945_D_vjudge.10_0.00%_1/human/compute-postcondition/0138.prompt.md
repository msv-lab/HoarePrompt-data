Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is `max_p - 1`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 1]`. If `y` is `1`, `a_values[0]` is added to `custo`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 1]`, and the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2]`. If `y` is 1, `a_values[0]` is added to `custo` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 2]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`y` is `max_p - 3`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, and `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, and `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 3]` and `a_values[0]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]` and `y` is not 1, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 3]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is greater than `a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[max_p - 3]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
