Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and m are integers for each test case where 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, a_i and b_i are lists of integers of length n where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; x is an input integer; `custos` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    custo = 0
    num_fila = 0
    max_p = 0
    a_values = []
    b_values = []
    nf = input().split()
    num_fila = int(nf[0])
    max_p = int(nf[1])
    a = input().split()
    b = input().split()
    for y in a:
        a_values.append(int(y))
    for y in b:
        b_values.append(int(y))
    for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
        if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
            custo += a_values[y]
        else:
            custo += b_values[y]
    for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
        if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
            custo += b_values[y]
            if y == 1:
                custo += a_values[0]
                break
        else:
            custo += a_values[y]
            break
    custos.append(custo)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `max_p - 1` down to 1, and if the sum of `a_values[0]` and `b_values[1]` is less than or equal to `a_values[1]`, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`. `custos` is a list containing the current value of `custo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has finished executing, `y` is `1`, `max_p` is greater than or equal to `2`, `num_fila` is greater than `max_p`, `custo` is the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for all `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `1`, with adjustments based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` for `y` from `max_p - 1` down to `1`, and `custo` is appended to the list `custos`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `y` is `0`, `custo` is increased by the sum of the minimum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `max_p - 1` to `1` (inclusive), and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `custos` is a list that includes the updated value of `custo`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
