Output State: **`b_values` is an empty list, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is 0, `max_p` is 0, `y` is 1, `custo` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the current value of `custo`, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 2, `a_values` is an empty list.**

The code snippet reassigns `b_values` to an empty list, but since it was already an empty list in the initial state, no change is observed. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
