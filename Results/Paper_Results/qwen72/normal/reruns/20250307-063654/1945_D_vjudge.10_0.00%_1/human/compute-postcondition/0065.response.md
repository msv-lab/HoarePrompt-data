Postcondition: ***`b_values` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `max_p` must be at least 2, `y` is `max_p - 3`, and `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 3]`. If `y` is 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
