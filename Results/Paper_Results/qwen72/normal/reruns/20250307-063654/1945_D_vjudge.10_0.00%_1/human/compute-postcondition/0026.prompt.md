Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers for each test case where 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, `a_i` and `b_i` are lists of integers of length `n` where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `x` must be greater than 0; `custos` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `custo` is 0; `num_fila` is the integer value of `nf[0]`; `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`; `a_values` is a list of integers, each integer is the integer value of the corresponding element in `a`; `b_values` is an empty list; `nf` is a list of strings; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for y in b:
    b_values.append(int(y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least one element, `y` is the first element in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of `y` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least two elements, `y` is the second element in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first element of `b` and the integer value of the second element of `b` as its last elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `y` is the third element in `b`, `b_values` is a list that now includes the integer value of the first element of `b`, the integer value of the second element of `b`, and the integer value of the third element of `b` as its last elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
