The only objects in the loop head are the list `a` and the variable `y`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `y` will be the second element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of strings obtained from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `y` is the second element in the list `a`, `a_values` is a list containing the integer value of the first element of `a` appended to it.**
