Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `N`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`. `nums_left` is decremented by 1.** 

In natural language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1 and it must remain less than `N`. If the updated value of `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is also incremented by 1. If `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, the value of `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`. Additionally, the value of `nums_left` is decreased by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
