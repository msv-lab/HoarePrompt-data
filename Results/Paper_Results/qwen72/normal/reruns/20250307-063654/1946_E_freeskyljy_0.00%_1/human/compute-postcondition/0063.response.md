Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers based on the input provided, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `R` is a list of integers input by the user, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is 1 or `M2` is 1 or (`L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`). `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`, and then further multiplied by the product of all `nums_left` values from `N - R[0] - 1` down to 1 modulo `MOD`. `nums_left` is 0, and `i` is `N`. If `i` was equal to any `R[cur]` during the loop, `cur` is incremented by 1 each time `i` matched `R[cur]`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs until `i` is no longer less than `N`.
- During each iteration, if `i` equals `R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- `nums_left` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `N` and `nums_left` will be 0.
- The value of `ans` will be the initial value (which is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`) further multiplied by the product of all `nums_left` values from `N - R[0] - 1` down to 1 modulo `MOD`.
- `cur` will be incremented each time `i` matched an element in `R`, starting from the second element of `R` (since `R[0]` is `N` and `i` starts at `N + 1` and decreases to `N`).
