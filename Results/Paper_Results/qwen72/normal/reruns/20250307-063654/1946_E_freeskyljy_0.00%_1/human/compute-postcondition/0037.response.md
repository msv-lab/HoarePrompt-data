Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers based on the input provided, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `R` is a list of integers input by the user, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is 1 or `M2` is 1 or (`L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`), `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`, `cur` is 0, `nums_left` is 0, and `i` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `cases`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`:** These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`:** The variable `ans` starts as the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. In each iteration where `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`, `ans` is multiplied by `nums_left` and then taken modulo `MOD`. Since `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and decreases by 1 each iteration, `ans` will be multiplied by all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1.
- **`cur`:** The variable `cur` starts at `M1 - 2` and decreases by 1 each time `i` equals `L[cur]`. Since the loop runs until `i` is 1, and `i` decreases by 1 each iteration, `cur` will eventually reach 0.
- **`nums_left`:** This variable starts at `L[-1] - 2` and decreases by 1 in each iteration. By the end of the loop, it will be 0.
- **`i`:** This variable starts at `N - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration. By the end of the loop, it will be 1.
