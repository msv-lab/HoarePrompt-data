It seems there was a mistake in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take parameters related to the permutation, prefix maximums, and suffix maximums. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def count_permutations(t, cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (n, m_1, m_2, p, s) with n being an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, m_1 and m_2 being integers such that 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n, p being a list of m_1 integers in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and s being a list of m_2 integers in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
