Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function checks if the last element of the prefix maximums list `L` is equal to the first element of the suffix maximums list `R`. This is necessary because the maximum element of the permutation (which is `N`) must be a common point between the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It also checks if the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is `N`. This ensures that the permutation starts with the smallest element and ends with the largest element, which is a requirement for valid prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The function further checks if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. This condition ensures that the permutation does not have overlapping prefix and suffix maximums that would invalidate the permutation structure.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` using `math.comb`. This step is correct because it represents the number of ways to choose positions for the elements that are not the maximum element in the permutation.

3. **Product Calculation**:
   - The function then iterates from `L[-1] - 1` down to 1, multiplying `ans` by the number of available positions for each element. This is done to account for the permutations of the elements in the prefix.
   - Similarly, it iterates from `R[0] + 1` to `N`, multiplying `ans` by the number of available positions for each element. This is done to account for the permutations of the elements in the suffix.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - All calculations are taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the number of suitable permutations. The conditions and calculations align with the requirements of the problem, and the modulo operation ensures the result is within the specified range.

Correctness: **True**
