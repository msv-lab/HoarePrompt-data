Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation and Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly checks if the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R` and returns `0` if this condition is not met. This is necessary because the maximum element of the permutation must be a common element in both the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It also checks if the first element of `L` is not `1` or the first element of `R` is not `N` and returns `0` if either condition is not met. This is because the smallest element (1) must be a prefix maximum, and the largest element (N) must be a suffix maximum.
   - The function checks if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`, and returns `0` if this condition is met. This is because it would imply a conflict in the placement of the second largest element, which cannot be both a prefix and suffix maximum simultaneously.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the binomial coefficient `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, which represents the number of ways to choose the positions of the elements that are not the global maximum (which is at position `L[-1]` and `R[0]`).
   - It then multiplies this by the product of the remaining integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1, modulo `MOD`. This step is correct as it accounts for the number of ways to arrange the elements in the prefix part of the permutation.

3. **Suffix Maximums Calculation**:
   - If `M2` is greater than 1, the function further multiplies `ans` by the product of the remaining integers from `N - R[0] - 1` down to 1, modulo `MOD`. This step is correct as it accounts for the number of ways to arrange the elements in the suffix part of the permutation.

4. **Final Return**:
   - The function returns `ans`, which is the final calculated value. This value is the number of suitable permutations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function appears to correctly handle all the specified conditions and calculations.

Correctness: **True**
