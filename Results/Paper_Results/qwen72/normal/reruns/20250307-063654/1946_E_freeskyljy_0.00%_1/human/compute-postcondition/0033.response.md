Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers based on the input provided, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `R` is a list of integers input by the user, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is 1 or `M2` is 1 or (`L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`), `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `N - 2`, and `N` must be greater than 2. If `i` equals `L[cur]`, `cur` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`. `ans` is now `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` updates the value of `ans`.
- `nums_left` is defined as `L[-1] - 4`.
- Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
