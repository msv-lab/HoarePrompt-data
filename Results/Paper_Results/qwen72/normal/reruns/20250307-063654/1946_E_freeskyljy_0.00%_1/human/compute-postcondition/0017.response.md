To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i > 1`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is `N - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `N - 1` must be greater than 1, which implies that `N` must be greater than 2.

Since `N` is already defined as an integer and the condition `N > 2` ensures that `i` will be greater than 1, no adjustment is needed for `i` to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers based on the input provided, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `R` is a list of integers input by the user, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is 1 or `M2` is 1 or (`L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`), `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `N - 1` and `N` must be greater than 2**
