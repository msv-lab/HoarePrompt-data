Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `N`, if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented by 1, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`, and `nums_left` is decremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `i` is increased by 1, but it must still be less than `N`. If the new value of `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is also increased by 1. If `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `ans` is updated to the result of `ans * nums_left % MOD`, and `nums_left` is decreased by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
