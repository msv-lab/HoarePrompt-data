### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `N`, the number of prefix maximums `M1`, and the number of suffix maximums `M2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums `L` and the indices of the suffix maximums `R`.

2. **Initial Validity Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index `L[-1]` is the same as the first suffix maximum index `R[0]`. This is a necessary condition for the permutation to be valid because the maximum element `N` must be at the same position in both the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It also checks if the first prefix maximum index `L[0]` is 1 and the first suffix maximum index `R[0]` is `N`. This ensures that the first element of the permutation is the first prefix maximum and the last element is the first suffix maximum.
   - It further checks if there are more than one prefix and suffix maximums and if the second-to-last prefix maximum index `L[-2]` is the same as the second suffix maximum index `R[1]`. This condition is necessary to avoid conflicts in the permutation structure, as it would imply that the same element is both a prefix and suffix maximum at different positions, which is impossible.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of ways to arrange the permutation using the combination formula `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is because the maximum element `N` must be at the position `L[-1]` (which is also `R[0]`), and the remaining `N-1` elements need to be arranged such that the prefix and suffix conditions are met.

4. **Left Side Arrangement:**
   - The program iterates from the position `L[-1] - 1` to 1, checking if the current index `i` is a prefix maximum. If it is, it moves to the next prefix maximum index. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the current position, modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This loop correctly ensures that the elements are placed in a way that maintains the prefix maximums.

5. **Right Side Arrangement:**
   - The program iterates from the position `R[0] + 1` to `N`, checking if the current index `i` is a suffix maximum. If it is, it moves to the next suffix maximum index. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the current position, modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This loop correctly ensures that the elements are placed in a way that maintains the suffix maximums.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer is returned after all the necessary calculations and checks.
   - The use of modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures that the answer does not overflow and is within the required range.
