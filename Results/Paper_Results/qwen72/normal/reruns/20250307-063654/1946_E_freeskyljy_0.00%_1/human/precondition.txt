t is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4, n, m_1, and m_2 are integers such that 1 \le m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, p is a list of m_1 integers where p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_{m_1} and 1 \le p_i \le n, s is a list of m_2 integers where s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_{m_2} and 1 \le s_i \le n. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
