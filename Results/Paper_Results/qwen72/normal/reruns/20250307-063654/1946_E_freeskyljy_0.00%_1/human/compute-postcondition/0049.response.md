The value of `nums_left` is decremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers based on the input provided, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `R` is a list of integers input by the user, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is 1 or `M2` is 1 or (`L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`). `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, and `i` is `N - 1`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `ans` is further multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `cur` remains 1.**
