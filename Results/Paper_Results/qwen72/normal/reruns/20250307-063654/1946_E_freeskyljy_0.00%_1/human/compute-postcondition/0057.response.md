The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `N`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should still be less than `N`.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `N`**
