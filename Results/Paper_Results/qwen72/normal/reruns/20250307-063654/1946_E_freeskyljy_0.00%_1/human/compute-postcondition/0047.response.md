Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers based on the input provided, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `R` is a list of integers input by the user, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is 1 or `M2` is 1 or (`L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`). `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`, then multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, `cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, and `i` is `N - 1`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = ans * nums_left % MOD` updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- `ans` was initially the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`.
- After the execution, `ans` is now the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`, and then further multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.
- The values of `t`, `cases`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, `nums_left`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `i` is not equal to `R[cur]` remains valid.
