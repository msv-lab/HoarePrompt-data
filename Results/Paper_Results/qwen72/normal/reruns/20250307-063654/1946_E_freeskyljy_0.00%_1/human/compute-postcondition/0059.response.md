Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `N`, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`**. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `N`. The value of `ans` is updated to the result of `ans` multiplied by `nums_left` and then taken modulo `MOD`. Other variables are not affected.
