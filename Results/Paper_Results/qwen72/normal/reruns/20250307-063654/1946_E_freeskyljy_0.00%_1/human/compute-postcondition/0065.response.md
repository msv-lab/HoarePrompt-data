Output State: **The program returns `ans`, which is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`, and further multiplied by the product of all `nums_left` values from `N - R[0] - 1` down to 1 modulo `MOD` if `M2` > 1. If `M2` is 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`.**
