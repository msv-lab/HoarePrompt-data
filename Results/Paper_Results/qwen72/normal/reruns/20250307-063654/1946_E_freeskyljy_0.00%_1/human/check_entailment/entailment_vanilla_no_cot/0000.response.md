Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is called in a loop, but it does not handle the input correctly. Specifically, it should read the input for each test case inside the loop, not outside.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The check `if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N:` should be `if L[0] != 1 or R[-1] != N:` because `R[-1]` is the last element of the suffix maximums, which should be `N`.
   - The check `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]):` is incorrect. It should be `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1] or L[1] == R[-2]):` to ensure that the second last prefix maximum and the second suffix maximum do not overlap in a way that makes the permutation invalid.

3. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The initial combination calculation `ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` is incorrect. The combination should be calculated based on the number of positions available for the remaining elements, not just the last prefix maximum.

4. **Loop for Prefix Maximums**:
   - The loop for prefix maximums is not correctly handling the positions. It should ensure that the elements between the prefix maximums are placed correctly.

5. **Loop for Suffix Maximums**:
   - The loop for suffix maximums is also not correctly handling the positions. It should ensure that the elements between the suffix maximums are placed correctly.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation should be applied consistently to ensure that the result does not overflow.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.readline
MOD = 1000000007

def func_1():
    (N, M1, M2) = map(int, input().split())
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    R = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if L[-1] != R[0]:
        return 0
    if L[0] != 1 or R[-1] != N:
        return 0
    if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1] or L[1] == R[-2]):
        return 0
    
    ans = 1
    last_prefix = 0
    for i in range(M1):
        ans = ans * math.comb(L[i] - 1 - last_prefix, i) % MOD
        last_prefix = L[i]
    
    last_suffix = N + 1
    for i in range(M2 - 1, -1, -1):
        ans = ans * math.comb(last_suffix - R[i] - 1, N - 1 - R[i]) % MOD
        last_suffix = R[i]
    
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The input for each test case is read inside the loop.
2. **Initial Checks**: Corrected the checks to ensure the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `N`. Also, added the correct overlap check.
3. **Combination Calculation**: The combination is calculated for the positions between the prefix and suffix maximums.
4. **Loops for Prefix and Suffix Maximums**: The loops correctly handle the placement of elements between the maximums.
5. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied consistently to ensure the result is within the required range.

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
