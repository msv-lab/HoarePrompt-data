### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input and Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `N`, `M1`, and `M2` (the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums).
   - It then reads the lists `L` and `R` which contain the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums, respectively.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program first checks if the last element of `L` (the last prefix maximum) is not equal to the first element of `R` (the first suffix maximum). If this condition is true, it returns 0 because the permutation cannot be valid.
   - It then checks if the first element of `L` is not 1 or the first element of `R` is not `N`. If either condition is true, it returns 0 because the permutation cannot be valid.
   - Finally, it checks if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and if the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`. If this condition is true, it returns 0 because the permutation cannot be valid.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial combination `ans` as `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This represents the number of ways to choose the positions for the elements that are not the last prefix maximum.
   - It then iterates over the elements from `L[-1] - 1` down to 1, multiplying `ans` by the number of remaining elements that are not prefix maximums, and taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

4. **Suffix Maximums Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of remaining elements that are not suffix maximums and multiplies `ans` by this number, taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - It iterates over the elements from `R[0] + 1` to `N`, multiplying `ans` by the number of remaining elements that are not suffix maximums, and taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Final Return:**
   - The program returns the final value of `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Prefix and Suffix Maximums:**
  - The conditions checked in the initial checks ensure that the permutation is valid based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
  - The combination calculation and the subsequent iterations correctly account for the number of ways to arrange the elements that are not prefix or suffix maximums.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The program uses the modulo operation to ensure that the result does not exceed `10^9 + 7`, which is a common requirement in competitive programming to handle large numbers.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `M1` or `M2` is 1, ensuring that the calculations are correct in these scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and conditions. The combination and modulo operations are used appropriately, and the checks ensure that the permutation is valid.

### Correctness:
**True**
