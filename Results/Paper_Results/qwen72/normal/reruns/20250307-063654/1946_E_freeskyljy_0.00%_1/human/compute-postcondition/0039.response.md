Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers based on the input provided, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `R` is a list of integers input by the user, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is 1 or `M2` is 1 or (`L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`). If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`, `cur` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, and `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`.**
