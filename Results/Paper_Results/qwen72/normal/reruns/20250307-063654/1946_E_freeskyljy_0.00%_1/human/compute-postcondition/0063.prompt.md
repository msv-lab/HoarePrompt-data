Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers based on the input provided, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `R` is a list of integers input by the user, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is 1 or `M2` is 1 or (`L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`). `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`, `cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, and `i` is `N + 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers based on the input provided, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `R` is a list of integers input by the user, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is 1 or `M2` is 1 or (`L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`). `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, and `i` is `N`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `ans` is further multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `cur` remains 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers based on the input provided, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `R` is a list of integers input by the user, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is 1 or `M2` is 1 or (`L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`). `M2` is greater than 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, and `i` must be less than `N`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is further multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `N`, if `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented by 1, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`, and `nums_left` is decremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
