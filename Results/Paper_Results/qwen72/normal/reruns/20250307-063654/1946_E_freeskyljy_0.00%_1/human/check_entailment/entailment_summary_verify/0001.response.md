### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `N`, the number of prefix maximums `M1`, and the number of suffix maximums `M2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums `L` and the indices of the suffix maximums `R`.

2. **Initial Validity Checks:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index `L[-1]` is the same as the first suffix maximum index `R[0]`. This is a necessary condition for the permutation to be valid because the maximum element `N` must be at a position that is both a prefix and a suffix maximum.
   - It checks if the first prefix maximum index `L[0]` is 1 and the first suffix maximum index `R[0]` is `N`. This is correct because the first element of the permutation must be the first prefix maximum and the last element must be the first suffix maximum.
   - It further checks if there are more than one prefix and suffix maximums and if the second-to-last prefix maximum index `L[-2]` is the same as the second suffix maximum index `R[1]`. If this condition is true, it returns 0 because it would imply a conflict in the permutation structure, as the second-to-last prefix maximum and the second suffix maximum cannot be the same if there are more than one of each.

3. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of ways to arrange the permutation using the combination formula `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. This is correct because the maximum element `N` must be at the position `L[-1]` (which is also `R[0]`), and the remaining `N-1` elements need to be arranged such that the prefix and suffix conditions are met.

4. **Left Side Arrangement:**
   - The program iterates from the position `L[-1] - 1` down to 1, checking if the current index `i` is a prefix maximum. If it is, it moves to the next prefix maximum index. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the current position, modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures that the elements between the prefix maximums are arranged in a way that maintains the prefix maximum property.

5. **Right Side Arrangement:**
   - The program iterates from the position `R[0] + 1` up to `N`, checking if the current index `i` is a suffix maximum. If it is, it moves to the next suffix maximum index. If not, it multiplies the answer by the number of remaining elements that can be placed in the current position, modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This logic is correct because it ensures that the elements between the suffix maximums are arranged in a way that maintains the suffix maximum property.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer is returned after all the necessary calculations and checks.
   - The use of modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures that the answer does not overflow and is within the required range.

### Additional Considerations:
- The function `func_1` is called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem description.
- The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when `M1` or `M2` is 1, by skipping the respective iteration and directly returning the calculated combination value.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided problem description and constraints. The logic and checks are well-implemented, and the use of modulo ensures the answer is within the required range.

Final: **True**
