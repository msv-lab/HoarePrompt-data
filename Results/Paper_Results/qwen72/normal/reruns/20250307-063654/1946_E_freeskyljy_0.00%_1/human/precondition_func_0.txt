t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (n, m_1, m_2, p, s) with n being an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, m_1 and m_2 being integers such that 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n, p being a list of m_1 integers in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and s being a list of m_2 integers in strictly increasing order such that 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
