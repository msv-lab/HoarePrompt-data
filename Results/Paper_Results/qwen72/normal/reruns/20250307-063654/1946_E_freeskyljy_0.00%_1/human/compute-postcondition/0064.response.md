Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers based on the input provided, `L` is a list of integers input by the user, `R` is a list of integers input by the user, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, `R[0]` is `N`, either `M1` is 1 or `M2` is 1 or (`L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`). If `M2` > 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`, and then further multiplied by the product of all `nums_left` values from `N - R[0] - 1` down to 1 modulo `MOD`. `nums_left` is 0, and `i` is `N`. If `i` was equal to any `R[cur]` during the loop, `cur` is incremented by 1 each time `i` matched `R[cur]`. Otherwise, if `M2` is 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, and `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`.***
