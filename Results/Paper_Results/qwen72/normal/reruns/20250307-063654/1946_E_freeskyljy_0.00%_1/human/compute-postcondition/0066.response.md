The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but operates on predefined variables and structures that are not explicitly passed as arguments. However, based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a tuple containing `(n, m_1, m_2, p, s)`. Here, `n` is the size of the problem, `m_1` and `m_2` are the lengths of two lists `p` and `s`, respectively, which contain integers in strictly increasing order.

The function returns:
- **Case_1**: 0
- **Case_2**: 0
- **Case_3**: 0
- **Case_4**: A value `ans` which is calculated as follows:
  - If `m_2` is greater than 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`, and further multiplied by the product of all `nums_left` values from `N - R[0] - 1` down to 1 modulo `MOD`.
  - If `m_2` is 1, `ans` is the combination of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by the product of all integers from `L[-1] - 2` down to 1 modulo `MOD`.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a tuple containing (n, m_1, m_2, p, s). It returns 0 in three cases and, in the fourth case, returns a calculated value `ans` which is a combination of binomial coefficients and products of integers, all taken modulo `MOD`.**
