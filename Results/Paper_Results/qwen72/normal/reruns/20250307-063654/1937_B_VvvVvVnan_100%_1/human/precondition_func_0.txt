The function should take three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each n[i] satisfies 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), and two lists of binary strings a1 and a2 (where each string a1[i] and a2[i] is of length n[i] and consists of characters '0' or '1'). The sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
