Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each n[i] satisfies 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), and two lists of binary strings a1 and a2 (where each string a1[i] and a2[i] is of length n[i] and consists of characters '0' or '1'). The sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition `def func_1():` does not match the problem description. The function should be defined with the appropriate parameters to match the problem requirements. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list, a1_list, a2_list):
```

With this corrected function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n_list is a list of integers where each n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, a1_list and a2_list are lists of binary strings of lengths corresponding to each n in n_list, and each string consists of characters '0' or '1'. The sum of all n values in n_list does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
