Output State: **`i` is 2, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and must be at least 2, `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`**

The value of `i` remains 2, `ci` remains the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and must be at least 2, and the list `ops` now includes the additional tuple `(c, 2)`.
