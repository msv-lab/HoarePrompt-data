Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` contains `u` appended to its existing list, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input minus 1, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input minus 1, and `v` is appended to `u2vs[u]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`.
- The initial state specifies that `u2vs[u]` already contains `[v]`, so after the code is executed, `u2vs[u]` will contain `[v, v]`.
- The value of `u2vs[v]` remains unchanged and still contains `u` appended to its existing list.
- The values of `n`, `u`, and `v` remain the same as specified in the initial state.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `u2vs[u]` and the unchanged values of `n`, `u2vs[v]`, `u`, and `v`.
