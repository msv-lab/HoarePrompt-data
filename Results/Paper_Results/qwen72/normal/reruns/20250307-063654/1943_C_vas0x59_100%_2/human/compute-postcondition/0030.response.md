Postcondition: **`n` is the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to the last node in `path_ba`, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is -1, the loop or if statement is broken, and all other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`) retain their values as described in the precondition. Otherwise, `n` retains its value greater than 1, and the loop continues to execute as described in the precondition.**
