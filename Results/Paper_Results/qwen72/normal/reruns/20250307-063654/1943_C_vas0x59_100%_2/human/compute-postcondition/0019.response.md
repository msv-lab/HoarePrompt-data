Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` contains `u` appended to its existing list, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input minus 1, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input minus 1, and `v` is appended to `u2vs[u]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`.
- The initial state specifies that `u2vs[v]` already contains `u` appended to its existing list.
- After executing the code, `u2vs[v]` will contain `u` appended one more time.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
