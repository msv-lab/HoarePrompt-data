Output State: **`path_ba` is a list of nodes that must have at least 4 nodes, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `i` is 1, `ops` contains the tuple `(c1, 1)` and the tuple `(c2, 1)`**

The code `ops.append((c2, i))` adds the tuple `(c2, 1)` to the list `ops`. The value of `i` is 1, and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
