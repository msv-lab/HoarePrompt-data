To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `path_ba` now contains the full sequence of nodes from the last node in the initial `path_ba` back to node 0, in reverse order.
   - `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has reached the start node (node 0) and has stopped.
   - All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
   - The length of `path_ba` is either odd or even, and based on this, the variable `ops` is populated differently.

2. **Conditions for `ops` based on the length of `path_ba`:**
   - **If the length of `path_ba` is odd:**
     - `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
     - `i` is `ci + 1`.
     - `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)` through `(c, ci)`.
   - **If the length of `path_ba` is even:**
     - `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
     - `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.
     - `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.
     - `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.

3. **Calculating the length of `ops`:**
   - **For an odd length of `path_ba`:**
     - If `path_ba` has a length of \( L \) (which is odd), then `ci` is \( \left\lfloor \frac{L}{2} \right\rfloor \).
     - `ops` will contain tuples from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`, which means it will have \( ci + 1 \) elements.
     - Therefore, the length of `ops` will be \( \left\lfloor \frac{L}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 \).

   - **For an even length of `path_ba`:**
     - If `path_ba` has a length of \( L \) (which is even), then `ci2` is \( \frac{L}{2} \) and `ci1` is \( \frac{L}{2} - 1 \).
     - `i` is the last odd number less than \( L - ci1 \), which is \( L - \left( \frac{L}{2} - 1 \right) = \frac{L}{2} + 1 \).
     - The odd numbers from 1 up to \( \frac{L}{2} + 1 \) are \( 1, 3, 5, \ldots, \frac{L}{2} + 1 \).
     - The number of odd numbers up to \( \frac{L}{2} + 1 \) is \( \left\lfloor \frac{\frac{L}{2} + 1 + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{L + 2}{4} \right\rfloor \).
     - Each odd number `i` contributes two tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, so the total number of tuples in `ops` is \( 2 \times \left\lfloor \frac{L + 2}{4} \right\rfloor \).

4. **Final Output:**
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the length of `ops` will be \( \left\lfloor \frac{L}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 \).
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, the length of `ops` will be \( 2 \times \left\lfloor \frac{L + 2}{4} \right\rfloor \).

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ops)`. However, based on the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is the number of tuples in the ops list based on the length of path_ba)**

To be more precise:
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `len(ops)` will be \( \left\lfloor \frac{L}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 \).
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, `len(ops)` will be \( 2 \times \left\lfloor \frac{L + 2}{4} \right\rfloor \).
