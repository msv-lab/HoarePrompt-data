The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `ci`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `ci`. If `i` is less than `ci + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and must be at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to continue, `ci + 1` must be greater than 2, which means `ci` must be at least 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and must be at least 2, `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`**
