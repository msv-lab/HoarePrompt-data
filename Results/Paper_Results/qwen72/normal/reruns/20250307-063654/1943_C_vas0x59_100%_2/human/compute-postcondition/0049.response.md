To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change from one iteration to the next.

Given the loop head:
```
for i in range(ci + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `ci`

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `ci` must be at least 0
- `ops` contains the tuple `(c, 0)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the condition `i < ci + 1` must still hold true.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration.
2. **Check the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < ci + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `1 < ci + 1` must be true. This simplifies to `ci > 0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is 1
- `ci` must be at least 1 (since `ci` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again)
- `ops` remains unchanged

State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and must be at least 1, `ops` contains the tuple `(c, 0)`**
