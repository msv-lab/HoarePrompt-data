To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
1. **`path_ba`**: This list contains the full sequence of nodes from the last node in the initial `path_ba` back to node 0, in reverse order.
2. **`n`**: This variable is -1, indicating that the loop has reached the start node (node 0) and has stopped.
3. **Other Variables**: `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b` remain unchanged.
4. **Length of `path_ba`**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
     - `i` is `ci + 1`.
     - `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
     - `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)` through `(c, ci)`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even:
     - `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.
     - `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
     - `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.
     - `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Length of `path_ba`**:
   - Let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `L`.
   - If `L` is odd, `ci` is `L // 2` and `i` is `ci + 1`.
   - If `L` is even, `ci2` is `L // 2` and `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`. `i` is the last odd number less than `L - ci1`.

2. **Construct `ops`**:
   - If `L` is odd:
     - `ops` will contain tuples `(c, 0)` through `(c, ci)`.
   - If `L` is even:
     - `ops` will contain tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last odd number less than `L - ci1`.

3. **Map and Print**:
   - The `map` function applies the lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` to each tuple in `ops`.
   - The lambda function increments the first element of each tuple by 1 and keeps the second element as is.
   - The `print` function then prints each transformed tuple on a new line.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider two cases to illustrate the output:

#### Case 1: `path_ba` has an odd length
- Suppose `path_ba` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Length `L` is 5 (odd).
- `ci` is `5 // 2 = 2`.
- `i` is `ci + 1 = 3`.
- `ops` will be `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 2)]`.
- Applying the lambda function:
  - `(c, 0)` becomes `f'{c + 1} {0}'`.
  - `(c, 1)` becomes `f'{c + 1} {1}'`.
  - `(c, 2)` becomes `f'{c + 1} {2}'`.
- Output:
  ```
  c + 1 0
  c + 1 1
  c + 1 2
  ```

#### Case 2: `path_ba` has an even length
- Suppose `path_ba` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- Length `L` is 6 (even).
- `ci2` is `6 // 2 = 3`.
- `ci1` is `ci2 - 1 = 2`.
- `i` is the last odd number less than `6 - 2 = 4`, which is 3.
- `ops` will be `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3)]`.
- Applying the lambda function:
  - `(c1, 1)` becomes `f'{c1 + 1} {1}'`.
  - `(c2, 1)` becomes `f'{c2 + 1} {1}'`.
  - `(c1, 3)` becomes `f'{c1 + 1} {3}'`.
  - `(c2, 3)` becomes `f'{c2 + 1} {3}'`.
- Output:
  ```
  c1 + 1 1
  c2 + 1 1
  c1 + 1 3
  c2 + 1 3
  ```

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the structure of the problem, the `print` statement will output the transformed tuples from `ops` with the first element incremented by 1 and each tuple on a new line.

Output: **c + 1 0
c + 1 1
c + 1 2
...
or
c1 + 1 1
c2 + 1 1
c1 + 1 3
c2 + 1 3
... (depending on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even)**

This output will vary based on the specific values of `c`, `c1`, and `c2`, but the structure will follow the pattern described.
