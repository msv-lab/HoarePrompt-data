You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any arguments, but it reads input from the user. The input consists of multiple test cases, each describing a tree. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3. The list u2vs is initialized as a list of n empty lists, intended to store the adjacency list of the tree. The function assumes that the input is valid and that the edges provided form a tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of nodes that are connected to node `i` (each index is decreased by 1 from the user input). The loop has executed `n-1` times, and each time it has appended the corresponding `v` to `u2vs[u]` and `u` to `u2vs[v]`.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and `path_ba` now contains the full sequence of nodes from the last node in the initial `path_ba` back to node 0, in reverse order. The variable `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has reached the start node (node 0) and has stopped. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: `i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)` through `(c, ci)`.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: `path_ba` is a list of nodes that must have an even number of nodes, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.
    #State: *The loop has completed all iterations, and `path_ba` now contains the full sequence of nodes from the last node in the initial `path_ba` back to node 0, in reverse order. The variable `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has reached the start node (node 0) and has stopped. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)` through `(c, ci)`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`, and `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the length of `ops` will be \( \left\lfloor \frac{L}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 \).
    #   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, the length of `ops` will be \( 2 \times \left\lfloor \frac{L + 2}{4} \right\rfloor \).
    #
    #Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ops)`. However, based on the conditions, the output will be:
    #
    #Output:
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: c + 1 0
    #c + 1 1
    #c + 1 2
    #...
    #or
    #c1 + 1 1
    #c2 + 1 1
    #c1 + 1 3
    #c2 + 1 3
    #... (depending on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even)
    return None
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input from the user describing multiple test cases, each representing a tree with `n` vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3). It initializes an adjacency list for each tree and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
