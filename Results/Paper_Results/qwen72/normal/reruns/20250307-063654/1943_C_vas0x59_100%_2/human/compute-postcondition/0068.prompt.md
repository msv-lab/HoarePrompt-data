Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has completed all iterations, and `path_ba` now contains the full sequence of nodes from the last node in the initial `path_ba` back to node 0, in reverse order. The variable `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has reached the start node (node 0) and has stopped. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. `ops` is an empty list. Additionally, the length of `path_ba` is even. `ci2` is equal to half the length of `path_ba`. `ci1` is equal to `ci2 - 1`. `c1` is the node at the index `ci1` in `path_ba`. `c2` is the node at the index `ci2` in `path_ba`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path_ba` is a list of nodes that must have at least 4 nodes, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `i` is 1, `ops` contains the tuple `(c1, 1)` and the tuple `(c2, 1)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `path_ba` is a list of nodes that must have at least 5 nodes, `ci1` is 1, `ci2` is 2, `i` is 3, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `path_ba` is a list of nodes that must have at least 7 nodes, `ci1` is 1, `ci2` is 2, `i` is 5, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
