Output State: **`i` is 0, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `ci` must be at least 0, `ops` contains the tuple `(c, 0)`**. 

The tuple `(c, 0)` is appended to the list `ops`, where `c` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state. The values of `i` and `ci` remain unchanged.
