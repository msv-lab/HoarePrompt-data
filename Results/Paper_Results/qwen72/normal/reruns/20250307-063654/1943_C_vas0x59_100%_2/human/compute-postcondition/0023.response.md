Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of nodes that are connected to node `i` (each index is decreased by 1 from the user input). The loop has executed `n-1` times, and each time it has appended the corresponding `v` to `u2vs[u]` and `u` to `u2vs[v]`. `d` is now the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` is a list that contains the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `_` is a variable that is not used.**
