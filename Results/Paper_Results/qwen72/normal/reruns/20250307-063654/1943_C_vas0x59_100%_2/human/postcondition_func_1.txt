The function reads input from the user describing a tree with `n` vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3). It constructs an adjacency list `u2vs` representing the tree. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from node 0 to find the farthest node `a` and its distance `d`. Another BFS is performed from node `a` to find the farthest node `b` and its distance `d`. The function constructs a path `path_ba` from node `b` back to node `a`. Depending on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even, it generates a list of operations `ops` that either center around a single node `c` (if the path length is odd) or two nodes `c1` and `c2` (if the path length is even). Finally, the function prints the number of operations and the operations themselves in a specific format, and returns `None`.
