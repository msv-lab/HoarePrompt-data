Output State: **The function does not take any arguments, but it reads input from the user. The input consists of multiple test cases, each describing a tree. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3. The list `u2vs` is initialized as a list of `n` empty lists, intended to store the adjacency list of the tree. The function assumes that the input is valid and that the edges provided form a tree. `n` is now assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user.**
