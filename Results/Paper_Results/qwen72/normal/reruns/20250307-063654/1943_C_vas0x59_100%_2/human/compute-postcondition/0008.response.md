The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n` and the loop variable `_`. The loop variable `_` is not explicitly used in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted. The loop can execute again if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1, but since the loop has already executed once, `n` is effectively decreased by 1 in the context of the loop's remaining iterations.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` now contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` appended to its existing list, `u` is an integer provided by the user input and is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer provided by the user input and is decreased by 1.**
