Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of nodes that are connected to node `i` (each index is decreased by 1 from the user input). The loop has executed `n-1` times, and each time it has appended the corresponding `v` to `u2vs[u]` and `u` to `u2vs[v]`. `d` is now the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes, `previous` is a list that contains the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `_` is a variable that is not used, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to the last node in `path_ba`, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is -1, the loop or if statement is broken, and all other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`) retain their values as described in the precondition. Otherwise, `n` retains its value greater than 1, and `path_ba` now includes `n` as the last element. The loop continues to execute as described in the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the node preceding the last node in `path_ba`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `path_ba` now includes the new `n` as the last element, and `n` has been appended to `path_ba`. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the node preceding the last node in `path_ba`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `path_ba` now includes the new `n` as the second-to-last element, and `n` has been appended to `path_ba` as the last element. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `n` is now equal to `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
