The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0. This means that `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be explicitly set to a value, as it will take on values from `range(n - 1)` during each iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists**
