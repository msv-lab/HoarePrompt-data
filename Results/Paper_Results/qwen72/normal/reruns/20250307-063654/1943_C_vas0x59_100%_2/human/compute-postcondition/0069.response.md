Postcondition: ***The loop has completed all iterations, and `path_ba` now contains the full sequence of nodes from the last node in the initial `path_ba` back to node 0, in reverse order. The variable `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has reached the start node (node 0) and has stopped. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)` through `(c, ci)`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`, and `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.***
