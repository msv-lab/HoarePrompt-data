Output State: **`path_ba` is a list of nodes that must have at least 4 nodes, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `i` is 1, `ops` contains the tuple `(c1, 1)`**.

The code appends the tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 1, the tuple `(c1, 1)` is added to `ops`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
