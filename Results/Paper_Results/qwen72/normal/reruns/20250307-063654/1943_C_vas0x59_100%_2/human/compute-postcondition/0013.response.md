Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` now contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` appended to its existing list, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input and is decreased by 2, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input and is decreased by 2, and `v` is appended to `u2vs[u]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 2.
- The list `u2vs` remains a list of `n` lists.
- `u2vs[u]` still contains `[v]`.
- `u2vs[v]` now has `u` appended to its existing list.
- `u` is still the first integer provided by the user input and is decreased by 2.
- `v` is still the second integer provided by the user input and is decreased by 2.
- `v` is still appended to `u2vs[u]`.
- The new change is that `u` is appended to `u2vs[v]`.
