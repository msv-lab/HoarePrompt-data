Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` contains `u` appended to its existing list, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input, and `v` is appended to `u2vs[u]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `u` and `v` are the first and second integers provided by the user input, respectively, and both are decreased by 2.
- The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` updates `u` and `v` to the actual integers provided by the user input without the decrement by 2.
- The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged, including the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 and the structure of `u2vs` where `u2vs[u]` contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` contains `u` appended to its existing list.
