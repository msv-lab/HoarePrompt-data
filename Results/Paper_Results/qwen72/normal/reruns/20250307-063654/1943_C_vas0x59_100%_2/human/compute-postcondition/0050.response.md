Output State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and must be at least 1, `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 1 and `ops` initially contains the tuple `(c, 0)`, after the code execution, `ops` will contain both `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`. The values of `i` and `ci` remain unchanged.
