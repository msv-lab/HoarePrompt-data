The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n - 1`. If `n - 1` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3, because the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` contains `u` appended to its existing list, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input and is decreased by 2, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input and is decreased by 2, and `v` is appended to `u2vs[u]`**
