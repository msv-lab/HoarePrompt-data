Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where `u2vs[u]` now contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` now contains `u` appended to its existing list, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input and is decreased by 2, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input and is decreased by 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is decremented by 1, so if `v` was initially the second integer provided by the user input and decreased by 1, it is now decreased by 2.
- The values of `n` and `u` remain unchanged.
- The structure of `u2vs` remains the same, with `u2vs[u]` containing `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` containing `u` appended to its existing list.
