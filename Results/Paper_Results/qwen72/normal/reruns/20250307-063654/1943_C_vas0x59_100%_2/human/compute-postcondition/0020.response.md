Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of nodes that are connected to node `i` (each index is decreased by 1 from the user input). The loop has executed `n-1` times, and each time it has appended the corresponding `v` to `u2vs[u]` and `u` to `u2vs[v]`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at all.
- The list `u2vs` will have `n` elements, each of which is a list.
- Each element in `u2vs` at index `i` will contain the indices of nodes that are connected to node `i`.
- The indices in `u2vs` are based on the user inputs for `u` and `v`, each of which is decreased by 1.
- The loop has executed `n-1` times, and during each iteration, it has appended the corresponding `v` to the list at `u2vs[u]` and `u` to the list at `u2vs[v]`.
- After all iterations, `u2vs` will represent a graph where each node `i` has a list of its connected nodes.
