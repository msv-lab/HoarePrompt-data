The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the user, where each input test case describes a tree. For each test case, the input includes an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3. The function initializes a list `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists, which is intended to store the adjacency list of the tree. The function assumes that the input is valid and that the edges provided form a tree. The function returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function reads input from the user describing multiple test cases, each representing a tree with `n` vertices (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3). It initializes an adjacency list for each tree and returns `None`.**
