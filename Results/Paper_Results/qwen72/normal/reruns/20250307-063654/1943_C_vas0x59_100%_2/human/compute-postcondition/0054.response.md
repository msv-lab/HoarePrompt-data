Postcondition: **The loop has completed all iterations, and `path_ba` now contains the full sequence of nodes from the last node in the initial `path_ba` back to node 0, in reverse order. The variable `n` is -1, indicating that the loop has reached the start node (node 0) and has stopped. All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. `ops` is an empty list. Additionally, the length of `path_ba` is even.**
