Output State: **`n` is the node preceding the last node in `path_ba`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `path_ba` now includes the new `n` as the second-to-last element, and `n` has been appended to `path_ba` as the last element. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `n` is now equal to `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.**
