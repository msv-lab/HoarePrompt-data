Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x` (where `x` was 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` was 2), `b[2]` is `b[1] + x` (where `x` was 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` was 2)**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and must be greater than or equal to 3.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `x` is updated based on the condition `a[3] > 1`. If `a[3]` is greater than 1, `x` is set to 1; otherwise, `x` is set to 2.
- The values of `b[1]` and `b[2]` are not affected by the code snippet and remain as `b[1] = b[0] + x` and `b[2] = b[1] + x`, where `x` was determined by the initial state based on `a[2]`.
