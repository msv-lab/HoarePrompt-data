Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x` (where `x` was 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` was 2), `b[2]` is `b[1] + x` (where `x` was 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` was 2), `b[3]` is `b[2] + x` (where `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2).**
