You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `q` queries. For each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i` are provided (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n), representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The function should determine if each subarray is "good" based on the conditions specified. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `q` times, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`, `a` is now a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that index in the original `a` list, and 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` for each of the `q` iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Good Array Definition**:
   - An array \( a \) of length \( m \) is good if there exists an array \( b \) of the same length such that:
     - The sum of elements in \( a \) equals the sum of elements in \( b \).
     - \( a_i \neq b_i \) for every index \( i \) from 1 to \( m \).
     - \( b_i > 0 \) for every index \( i \) from 1 to \( m \).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the array \( c \) and the queries.
   - For each query, it determines if the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) is good and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases using `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - It reads the length of the array \( n \) and the number of queries \( q \).
     - It reads the array \( c \) and prepends a 0 to it for easier prefix sum calculations.
   - **Constructing Array \( b \)**:
     - It initializes an array \( b \) with zeros and the same length as \( c \).
     - For each element in \( c \), it sets \( b[i] \) to \( b[i-1] + 1 \) if \( c[i] > 1 \), otherwise \( b[i-1] + 2 \).
     - This construction ensures that \( b_i > 0 \) and \( b_i \neq c_i \) for all \( i \).
   - **Prefix Sums**:
     - It computes the prefix sums of \( c \) and stores them in \( a \).
   - **Processing Queries**:
     - For each query, it reads the indices \( l_i \) and \( r_i \).
     - It checks if the sum of the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) is less than the corresponding sum in \( b \) or if \( l_i \) equals \( r_i \).
     - If either condition is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Check:
1. **Sum Condition**:
   - The sum of the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) is calculated as \( a[r_i] - a[l_i - 1] \).
   - The sum of the corresponding subarray in \( b \) is calculated as \( b[r_i] - b[l_i - 1] \).
   - The program checks if the sum of \( c \) is less than the sum of \( b \). If it is, then it is impossible to find a \( b \) that satisfies all conditions, so it prints "NO".

2. **Non-equality Condition**:
   - The program ensures that \( b_i \neq c_i \) by setting \( b_i \) to \( b[i-1] + 1 \) if \( c[i] > 1 \) and \( b[i-1] + 2 \) if \( c[i] = 1 \).
   - This guarantees that \( b_i \) is always different from \( c_i \).

3. **Positive Elements Condition**:
   - The program ensures that \( b_i > 0 \) by always adding 1 or 2 to the previous element in \( b \).

4. **Single Element Subarray**:
   - If \( l_i \) equals \( r_i \), the subarray has only one element. In this case, it is impossible to find a \( b \) such that \( b_i \neq c_i \) and \( b_i > 0 \), so the program correctly prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.
