### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - The function reads the length of the array \( n \) and the number of queries \( q \).
     - It reads the array \( c \) and prepends a 0 to it for easier prefix sum calculations.
     - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

   - **Constructing Array \( b \)**:
     - The function initializes an array \( b \) with zeros and the same length as \( c \).
     - For each element in \( c \), it sets \( b[i] \) to \( b[i-1] + 1 \) if \( c[i] > 1 \), otherwise \( b[i-1] + 2 \).
     - This construction ensures that \( b_i > 0 \) and \( b_i \neq c_i \) for all \( i \). Specifically:
       - If \( c[i] > 1 \), then \( b[i] = b[i-1] + 1 \), which is different from \( c[i] \) and positive.
       - If \( c[i] = 1 \), then \( b[i] = b[i-1] + 2 \), which is different from \( c[i] \) and positive.
     - This part of the function is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

   - **Prefix Sums**:
     - The function computes the prefix sums of \( c \) and stores them in \( a \).
     - This is correct and helps in efficiently calculating the sum of any subarray of \( c \).

   - **Processing Queries**:
     - For each query, the function reads the indices \( l_i \) and \( r_i \).
     - It checks if the sum of the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) is less than the corresponding sum in \( b \) or if \( l_i \) equals \( r_i \).
     - If either condition is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".
     - This part of the function is correct and aligns with the problem requirements:
       - If the sum of the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in \( b \), it is impossible to find a \( b \) such that the sum of \( b \) equals the sum of \( c \) and \( b_i \neq c_i \) for all \( i \).
       - If \( l_i \) equals \( r_i \), the subarray has only one element, and it is impossible to find a \( b \) such that \( b_i \neq c_i \) and \( b_i > 0 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
