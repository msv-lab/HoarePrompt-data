#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `q` queries. For each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i` are provided (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n), representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The function should determine if each subarray is "good" based on the conditions specified. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `q` times, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`, `a` is now a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that index in the original `a` list, and 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` for each of the `q` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `a` of positive integers and a number of queries `q`. It then computes a secondary array `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1. After processing, `a` is transformed into a list of cumulative sums of its original elements. For each query, the function checks if the sum of elements in the subarray `a[x:y]` is less than the corresponding sum in the subarray `b[x:y]` or if the query indices are the same (`x == y`). If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each query.
