You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `a` of positive integers and a number of queries `q`. It then computes a secondary array `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1. After processing, `a` is transformed into a list of cumulative sums of its original elements. For each query, the function checks if the sum of elements in the subarray `a[x:y]` is less than the corresponding sum in the subarray `b[x:y]` or if the query indices are the same (`x == y`). If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has a length of 1. According to the problem description, a subarray of length 1 cannot be good because there is no way to construct a different array `b` of the same length where `b_i > 0` and `a_i != b_i`. The program, however, does not handle this edge case correctly. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```

The program will output:

```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

For the query `4 4`, the subarray is `[4]`, which has a length of 1. The program incorrectly prints `NO` instead of `YES` for this case. The correct output should be `NO` for the query `4 4` because a subarray of length 1 cannot be good. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
