Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2, `a` is now a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that index in the original `a` list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` is still `n + 1`.
- The value of `x` is still 1 if `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
- The values of `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n` remain the same, with each `b[i]` being `b[i - 1] + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.
- The list `a` is now updated to be the cumulative sum of the original `a` list. Each element in the new `a` list is the sum of all previous elements up to that index in the original `a` list.
