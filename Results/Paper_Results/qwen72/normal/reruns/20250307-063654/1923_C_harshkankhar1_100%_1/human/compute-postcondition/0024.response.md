The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n`, where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n), representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The function should determine if each subarray is "good" based on the conditions specified. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it returns whether the specified subarray of `c` is "good" based on certain conditions.**
