The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the array `c`, and `q` is a positive integer representing the number of queries.
- The sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the integers provided by the user input.
- `b` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where all elements are 0.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must start at 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
