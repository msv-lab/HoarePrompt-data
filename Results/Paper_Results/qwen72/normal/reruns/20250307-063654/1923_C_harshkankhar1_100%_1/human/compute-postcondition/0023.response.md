Output State: **The loop has executed `q` times, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`, `a` is now a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that index in the original `a` list, and 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` for each of the `q` iterations.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all `q` iterations.
- The value of `n` has not changed throughout the loop.
- The value of `i` is still `n + 1` as it was not modified inside the loop.
- The list `a` has been transformed into a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that index in the original `a` list.
- The list `b` has been updated such that for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.
- For each of the `q` iterations, the loop reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, and prints 'NO' if the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` is true, otherwise it prints 'YES'.
