You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `q` queries. For each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i` are provided (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n), representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The function should determine if each subarray is "good" based on the conditions specified. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `q` times, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + 1` if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`, `a` is now a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that index in the original `a` list, and 'NO' or 'YES' is printed based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` for each of the `q` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it returns whether the specified subarray of `c` is "good" based on certain conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
