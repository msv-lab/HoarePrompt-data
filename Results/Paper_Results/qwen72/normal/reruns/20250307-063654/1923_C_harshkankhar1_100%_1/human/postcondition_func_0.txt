The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array `a` of positive integers and a number of queries `q`. It then computes a secondary array `b` where each element is the cumulative sum of 1s and 2s based on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1. After processing, `a` is transformed into a list of cumulative sums of its original elements. For each query, the function checks if the sum of elements in the subarray `a[x:y]` is less than the corresponding sum in the subarray `b[x:y]` or if the query indices are the same (`x == y`). If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each query.
