The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `q` queries where each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The total number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
