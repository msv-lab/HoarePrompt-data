### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotated version and the original assessment.

1. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over them, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - This is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - The function reads the length of the array \( n \) and the number of queries \( q \).
     - It reads the array \( c \) and prepends a 0 to it for easier prefix sum calculations.
     - This is correct and matches the problem description.

   - **Constructing Array \( b \)**:
     - The function initializes an array \( b \) with zeros and the same length as \( c \).
     - For each element in \( c \), it sets \( b[i] \) to \( b[i-1] + 1 \) if \( c[i] > 1 \), otherwise \( b[i-1] + 2 \).
     - This construction ensures that \( b_i > 0 \) and \( b_i \neq c_i \) for all \( i \):
       - If \( c[i] > 1 \), \( b[i] = b[i-1] + 1 \), which is different from \( c[i] \) because \( c[i] \) is at least 2.
       - If \( c[i] = 1 \), \( b[i] = b[i-1] + 2 \), which is different from \( c[i] \) because \( c[i] \) is 1.
     - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

   - **Prefix Sums**:
     - The function computes the prefix sums of \( c \) and stores them in \( a \).
     - This is correct and matches the problem description.

   - **Processing Queries**:
     - For each query, it reads the indices \( l_i \) and \( r_i \).
     - It checks if the sum of the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) is less than the corresponding sum in \( b \) or if \( l_i \) equals \( r_i \).
     - If either condition is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".
     - **Sum Condition**:
       - The sum of the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) is calculated as \( a[r_i] - a[l_i - 1] \).
       - The sum of the corresponding subarray in \( b \) is calculated as \( b[r_i] - b[l_i - 1] \).
       - The program checks if the sum of \( c \) is less than the sum of \( b \). If it is, then it is impossible to find a \( b \) that satisfies all conditions, so it prints "NO".
       - This is correct and matches the problem description.
     - **Non-equality Condition**:
       - The program ensures that \( b_i \neq c_i \) by setting \( b_i \) to \( b[i-1] + 1 \) if \( c[i] > 1 \) and \( b[i-1] + 2 \) if \( c[i] = 1 \).
       - This guarantees that \( b_i \) is always different from \( c_i \).
       - This is correct and matches the problem description.
     - **Positive Elements Condition**:
       - The program ensures that \( b_i > 0 \) by always adding 1 or 2 to the previous element in \( b \).
       - This is correct and matches the problem description.
     - **Single Element Subarray**:
       - If \( l_i \) equals \( r_i \), the subarray has only one element. In this case, it is impossible to find a \( b \) such that \( b_i \neq c_i \) and \( b_i > 0 \), so the program correctly prints "NO".
       - This is correct and matches the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

Final: **True**
