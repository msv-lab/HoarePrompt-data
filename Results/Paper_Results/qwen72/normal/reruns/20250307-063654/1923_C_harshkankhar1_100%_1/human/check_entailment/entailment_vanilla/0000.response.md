Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Good Array Definition**:
   - An array \( a \) of length \( m \) is good if there exists an array \( b \) of the same length such that:
     - The sum of elements in \( a \) equals the sum of elements in \( b \).
     - \( a_i \neq b_i \) for every index \( i \) from 1 to \( m \).
     - \( b_i > 0 \) for every index \( i \) from 1 to \( m \).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the array \( c \) and the queries.
   - For each query, it determines if the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) is good and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases using `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - It reads the length of the array \( n \) and the number of queries \( q \).
     - It reads the array \( c \) and prepends a 0 to it for easier prefix sum calculations.
   - **Constructing Array \( b \)**:
     - It initializes an array \( b \) with zeros and the same length as \( c \).
     - For each element in \( c \), it sets \( b[i] \) to \( b[i-1] + 1 \) if \( c[i] > 1 \), otherwise \( b[i-1] + 2 \).
     - This construction ensures that \( b_i > 0 \) and \( b_i \neq c_i \) for all \( i \).
   - **Prefix Sums**:
     - It computes the prefix sums of \( c \) and stores them in \( a \).
   - **Processing Queries**:
     - For each query, it reads the indices \( l_i \) and \( r_i \).
     - It checks if the sum of the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) is less than the corresponding sum in \( b \) or if \( l_i \) equals \( r_i \).
     - If either condition is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Check:
1. **Sum Condition**:
   - The sum of the subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \) is calculated as \( a[r_i] - a[l_i - 1] \).
   - The sum of the corresponding subarray in \( b \) is calculated as \( b[r_i] - b[l_i - 1] \).
   - The program checks if the sum of \( c \) is less than the sum of \( b \). If it is, then it is impossible to find a \( b \) that satisfies all conditions, so it prints "NO".

2. **Non-equality Condition**:
   - The program ensures that \( b_i \neq c_i \) by setting \( b_i \) to \( b[i-1] + 1 \) if \( c[i] > 1 \) and \( b[i-1] + 2 \) if \( c[i] = 1 \).
   - This guarantees that \( b_i \) is always different from \( c_i \).

3. **Positive Elements Condition**:
   - The program ensures that \( b_i > 0 \) by always adding 1 or 2 to the previous element in \( b \).

4. **Single Element Subarray**:
   - If \( l_i \) equals \( r_i \), the subarray has only one element. In this case, it is impossible to find a \( b \) such that \( b_i \neq c_i \) and \( b_i > 0 \), so the program correctly prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
