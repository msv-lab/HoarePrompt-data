Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x` updates the value of `b[1]` to be the sum of `b[0]` and `x`. The value of `x` is determined by the condition that if `a[1]` is greater than 1, then `x` is 1; otherwise, `x` is 2. The values of `n`, `i`, and the condition for `x` remain unchanged.
