Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0] + x`, `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `x` remains 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` remains 2.
- The value of `b[1]` remains `b[0] + x`.
- The value of `b[2]` is updated to `b[1] + x`.
