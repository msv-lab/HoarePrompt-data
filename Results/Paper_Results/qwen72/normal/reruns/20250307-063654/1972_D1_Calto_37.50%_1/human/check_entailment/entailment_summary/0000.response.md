### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. It is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD function.
   - **`func_2(n, m)`**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the logic within `func_2` does not seem to align with the problem statement. Specifically:
     - The loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\), which is incorrect because \(b\) should range from 1 to \(m\).
     - The calculation inside the loop, `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, does not directly relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - The term `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` is also not clear and does not seem to be derived from the problem's constraints.

3. **Correctness of `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem. The loop and the calculations inside it do not match the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Expected Logic**:
   - For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), we need to count the number of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by iterating over all possible values of \(b\) and for each \(b\), iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and checking the condition.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
