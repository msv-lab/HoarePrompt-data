The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2,000,000 (inclusive). The function can return one of two values based on the conditions:

- **Case_1**: The function returns 1.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the value of `cnt`, which is calculated as the sum of `n + 1` and the terms \((n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + 1\) for each `i` from 2 to `m-1`. Here, `cnt` is not equal to 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2,000,000). It returns 1 in one case, and in another case, it returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `n + 1` and a series of terms calculated for each `i` from 2 to `m-1`.**
