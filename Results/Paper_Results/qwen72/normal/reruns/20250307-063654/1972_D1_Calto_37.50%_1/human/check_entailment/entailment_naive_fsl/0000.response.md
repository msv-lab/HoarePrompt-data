Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). The function `func_2` appears to have a flawed approach and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

For example, consider the test case \( n = 2 \) and \( m = 3 \). The correct pairs should be:
- (1, 1): \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) is a multiple of \( 1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1 \)
- (1, 2): \( 1 + 2 = 3 \) is not a multiple of \( 2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2 \)
- (1, 3): \( 1 + 3 = 4 \) is not a multiple of \( 3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3 \)
- (2, 1): \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) is a multiple of \( 1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1 \)
- (2, 2): \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) is a multiple of \( 2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4 \)
- (2, 3): \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) is not a multiple of \( 3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3 \)

The correct output for this test case should be 3, but the provided program does not produce this result. The logic in `func_2` is incorrect and does not handle the conditions specified in the problem description.
