Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic of `func_2`, which is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic used in `func_2` does not correctly implement the condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs by iterating over possible values of `b` and then calculating a corresponding `x` and `y`. However, this approach does not correctly reflect the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

2. **Incorrect Use of GCD**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers. However, `func_2` does not use this GCD function to check the condition for valid pairs.

3. **Logical Errors**:
   - The loop in `func_2` iterates from 1 to \(m-1\) instead of 1 to \(m\). This means it misses the last possible value of `b`.
   - The calculation `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not make sense in the context of the problem. It seems to be an attempt to find a pattern, but it does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

To correctly solve the problem, you need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

# Function to calculate GCD
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Function to count valid pairs
def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Reading input
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# Printing results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This program correctly iterates over all possible pairs (a, b) and checks the condition using the GCD function. It should produce the correct output for the given problem.
