Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n - 0` which is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression `i * i - i` evaluates to `1 * 1 - 1`, which is 0. Therefore, `x` is assigned the value of `n - 0`, which is simply `n`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `cnt`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
