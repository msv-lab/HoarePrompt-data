Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `x` is `n` - 2, `y` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `n` - (2 * 2 - 2), which simplifies to `n` - 2. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `cnt`, `i`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
