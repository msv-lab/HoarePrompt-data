The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 1 because `range(1, m)` will produce a sequence of numbers from 1 to `m-1`. If `m` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute. The variable `i` will start at 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1**
