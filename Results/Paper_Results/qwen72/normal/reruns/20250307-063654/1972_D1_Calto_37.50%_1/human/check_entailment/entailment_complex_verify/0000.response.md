Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates from \(i = 1\) to \(i = m-1\). This means that the value \(i = m\) is never considered, which is a potential issue since \(b\) can be \(m\).

2. **Calculation of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is calculated as \(n - (i * i - i)\).
   - `y` is calculated as \(i * i\).
   - The term `x // y` is added to `cnt`, and an additional 1 is added if \(i > 1\).

3. **Condition Check**:
   - If `cnt` is 0 after the loop, the function returns 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the value of `cnt`.

### Correctness of the Logic:
- The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The provided logic in `func_2` does not directly check this condition. Instead, it performs a series of calculations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
  - The correct pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
  - The program should count these pairs, but it does not do so correctly.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **First Test Case**:
  - \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - The only pair is \((1, 1)\), which satisfies the condition.
  - The program should return 1, and it does.

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
  - The correct pairs are:
    - \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\)
    - \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\)
    - \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\)
    - \((3, 1)\): \(3 + 1 = 4\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\)
    - \((4, 1)\): \(4 + 1 = 5\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(4, 1) = 1\)
    - \((5, 1)\): \(5 + 1 = 6\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(5, 1) = 1\)
    - \((6, 1)\): \(6 + 1 = 7\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(6, 1) = 1\)
    - \((6, 2)\): \(6 + 2 = 8\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(6, 2) = 4\)
    - \((6, 3)\): \(6 + 3 = 9\) is a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 3\)
    - \((7, 1)\): \(7 + 1 = 8\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(7, 1) = 1\)
    - \((8, 1)\): \(8 + 1 = 9\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(8, 1) = 1\)
    - \((9, 1)\): \(9 + 1 = 10\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(9, 1) = 1\)
    - \((10, 1)\): \(10 + 1 = 11\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(10, 1) = 1\)
    - \((10, 2)\): \(10 + 2 = 12\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(10, 2) = 4\)

  - The correct output should be 14, but the provided program does not produce this result.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program.

Final: **False**
