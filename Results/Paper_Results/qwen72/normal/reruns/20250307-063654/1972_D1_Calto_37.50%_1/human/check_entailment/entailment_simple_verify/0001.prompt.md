You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **func_2(n, m)**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers. It is correct and works as expected.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`
Let's break down the logic of this function:
1. **Initialization**: `cnt = 0` initializes the count of valid pairs to zero.
2. **Loop**: The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
3. **Calculations**:
   - `x = n - (i * i - i)`: This calculates \(x\) as \(n - (i^2 - i)\).
   - `y = i * i`: This calculates \(y\) as \(i^2\).
   - `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`: This updates the count by adding the integer division of \(x\) by \(y\) and an additional 1 if \(i > 1\).

4. **Final Check**: If `cnt` is zero, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD calculation in `func_1` is correct.
2. **Pair Counting Logic**: The logic in `func_2` is not clear and does not seem to correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem. Specifically:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the loop.
   - The calculations `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The addition of `(i > 1)` in the count update is not justified by the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs as specified in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
