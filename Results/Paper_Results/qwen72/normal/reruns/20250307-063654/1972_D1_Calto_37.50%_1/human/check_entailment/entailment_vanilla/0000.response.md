Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **func_2(n, m)**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers. It is correct and works as expected.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`
Let's break down the logic of this function:
1. **Initialization**: `cnt = 0` initializes the count of valid pairs to zero.
2. **Loop**: The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
3. **Calculations**:
   - `x = n - (i * i - i)`: This calculates \(x\) as \(n - (i^2 - i)\).
   - `y = i * i`: This calculates \(y\) as \(i^2\).
   - `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`: This updates the count by adding the integer division of \(x\) by \(y\) and an additional 1 if \(i > 1\).

4. **Final Check**: If `cnt` is zero, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Correctness Analysis:
1. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD calculation in `func_1` is correct.
2. **Pair Counting Logic**: The logic in `func_2` is not clear and does not seem to correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem. Specifically:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the loop.
   - The calculations `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The addition of `(i > 1)` in the count update is not justified by the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs as specified in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
