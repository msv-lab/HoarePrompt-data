Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1 + (`n` - 2) // 4 + 1, `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `x` is `n` - 6, `y` is 9.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated to `i * i`, which is 3 * 3 = 9. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `cnt`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
