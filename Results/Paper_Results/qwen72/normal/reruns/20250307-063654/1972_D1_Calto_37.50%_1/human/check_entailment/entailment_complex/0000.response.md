Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The function correctly returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.
   - The state comments are accurate: after the function call, `a` is the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1`, which is incorrect because it should iterate from 1 to `m` to consider all possible values of `b`.
   - The calculation inside the loop:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` are used to compute the number of valid `a` values for a given `b = i`.
     - The term `x // y` is supposed to count how many multiples of `y` fit into `x`.
     - The term `(i > 1)` adds 1 to the count if `i` is greater than 1, which is not clear why it is needed and seems incorrect.
   - The final return statement:
     - If `cnt` is 0, the function returns 1. This is incorrect because it should return the number of valid pairs, not a fixed value.
     - The function should return `cnt` directly without the special case for `cnt == 0`.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_2(n, m)`.
   - The function `func_2` is not correctly implemented to solve the given problem. The logic for counting valid pairs is flawed, and the loop range is incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
