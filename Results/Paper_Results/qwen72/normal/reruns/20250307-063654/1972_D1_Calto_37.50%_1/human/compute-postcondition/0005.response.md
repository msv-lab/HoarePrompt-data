The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to continue, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `x` is equal to `n`, `y` is 1**
