### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs as specified in the problem. Let's break down the reasoning in more detail:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. This part of the program is correct.

2. **Pair Counting Logic**:
   - The function `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)
   - However, the logic in `func_2` does not align with these conditions:
     - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\), but it does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
     - The calculations `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - The addition of `(i > 1)` in the count update is not justified by the problem statement and does not contribute to the correct count of valid pairs.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The corrected version of the program provided in the original assessment does exactly this:
     ```python
     import math

     def gcd(a, b):
         while b:
             a, b = b, a % b
         return a

     def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
         cnt = 0
         for a in range(1, n + 1):
             for b in range(1, m + 1):
                 if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                     cnt += 1
         return cnt

     # Reading input
     t = int(input())
     for _ in range(t):
         n, m = map(int, input().split())
         print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
     ```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided program is incorrect. The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem, and the corrected version provided in the assessment is the correct approach.

Final: **False**
