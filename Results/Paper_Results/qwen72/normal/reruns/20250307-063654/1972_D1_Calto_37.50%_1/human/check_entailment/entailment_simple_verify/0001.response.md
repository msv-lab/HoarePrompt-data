### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
     - It is a standard and correct implementation of GCD.

   - **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**:
     - **Initialization**: `cnt = 0` initializes the count of valid pairs to zero.
     - **Loop**: The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
     - **Calculations**:
       - `x = n - (i * i - i)`: This calculates \(x\) as \(n - (i^2 - i)\).
       - `y = i * i`: This calculates \(y\) as \(i^2\).
       - `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`: This updates the count by adding the integer division of \(x\) by \(y\) and an additional 1 if \(i > 1\).
     - **Final Check**: If `cnt` is zero, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not provide insight into the correctness of the logic.
   - The logic in `func_2` does not align with the problem's requirements:
     - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked.
     - The calculations `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not correspond to the problem's conditions.
     - The addition of `(i > 1)` in the count update is not justified by the problem statement.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided program does not perform this check and instead uses a different and incorrect logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs as specified in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
