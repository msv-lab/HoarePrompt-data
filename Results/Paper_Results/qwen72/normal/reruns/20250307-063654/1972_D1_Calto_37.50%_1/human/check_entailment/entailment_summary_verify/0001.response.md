### Reasoning:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This part of the program is accurate and works as expected.

2. **Pair Counting Logic**:
   - The function `func_2(n, m)` is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic used in this function does not align with the problem requirements.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\), but \(i\) is not used to represent \(b\) in the problem. Instead, \(i\) is used in a complex calculation that does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The calculation `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correspond to any part of the problem statement. The expression \(n - (i^2 - i)\) and \(i^2\) are not related to the conditions specified.
   - The update `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` is also not justified by the problem. The term `(i > 1)` adds an extra 1 to the count for each \(i > 1\), which is not part of the problem's requirements.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - For each pair, we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, we increment the count.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are:
     - \((1, 1)\)
     - \((2, 1)\)
     - \((2, 2)\)
     - \((3, 1)\)
     - \((4, 1)\)
     - \((5, 1)\)
     - \((6, 1)\)
     - \((6, 2)\)
     - \((6, 3)\)
     - \((7, 1)\)
     - \((8, 1)\)
     - \((9, 1)\)
     - \((10, 1)\)
     - \((10, 2)\)
   - The total number of valid pairs is 14, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs as specified in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
