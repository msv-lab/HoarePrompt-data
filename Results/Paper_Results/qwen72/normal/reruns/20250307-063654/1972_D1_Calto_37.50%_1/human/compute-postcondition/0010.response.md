The value of `x` is updated to `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is 3, `i * i - i` evaluates to `3 * 3 - 3`, which is 6. Therefore, `x` becomes `n - 6`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1 + (`n` - 2) // 4 + 1, `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `x` is `n` - 6, `y` is 4**
