Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is `n` - 6, `y` is 9, `cnt` is `n` + 1 + (`n` - 2) // 4 + 1 + (`n` - 6) // 9 + 1**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is updated by adding `x // y` and `(i > 1)`.
- `x // y` is the integer division of `x` by `y`, which is `(n - 6) // 9`.
- `(i > 1)` evaluates to 1 because `i` is 3, which is greater than 1.
- Therefore, `cnt` becomes `n + 1 + (n - 2) // 4 + 1 + (n - 6) // 9 + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
