Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `x` is equal to `n`, `y` is 1.**

The code snippet `y = i * i` assigns the value of `i` squared to `y`. Given that `i` is 1, `y` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `cnt`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged. The conditions that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, and `x` is equal to `n` are still valid.
