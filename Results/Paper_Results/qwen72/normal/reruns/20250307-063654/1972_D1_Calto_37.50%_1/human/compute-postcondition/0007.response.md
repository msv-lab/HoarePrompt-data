Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `x` is `n` - 2, `y` is 4.**

The value of `y` is updated to 4, which is the result of `i * i` where `i` is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
