Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1 + (`n` - 2) // 4 + 1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `x` is `n` - 2, `y` is 4.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is updated to `cnt` + `x` // `y` + (i > 1).
- `x` // `y` is (`n` - 2) // 4.
- Since `i` is 2, (i > 1) evaluates to 1.
- Therefore, `cnt` becomes `n` + 1 + (`n` - 2) // 4 + 1.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
