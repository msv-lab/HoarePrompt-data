Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `x` is equal to `n`, `y` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `x // y` and `(i > 1)`. Since `x` is equal to `n` and `y` is 1, `x // y` is equal to `n`. The condition `(i > 1)` evaluates to 0 because `i` is 1. Therefore, `cnt` becomes `n` + 0 + 1, which simplifies to `n` + 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
