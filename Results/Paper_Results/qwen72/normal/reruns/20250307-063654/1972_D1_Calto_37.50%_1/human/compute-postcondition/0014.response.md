Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is the sum of `n` + 1 and the terms (`n` - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + 1 for i from 2 to m-1, `i` is m-1, `x` is `n` - ((m-1) * (m-1) - (m-1)), `y` is (m-1) * (m-1), `m` is greater than 1, and the current value of `cnt` is 0.**
