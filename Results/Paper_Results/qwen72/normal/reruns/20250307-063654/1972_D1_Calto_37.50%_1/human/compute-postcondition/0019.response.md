Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2,000,000). It calculates a value `cnt` based on a series of operations involving `n` and each integer `i` from 1 to `m-1`. If `cnt` is 0 after the loop, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of the terms (`n` - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1) for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`. **
