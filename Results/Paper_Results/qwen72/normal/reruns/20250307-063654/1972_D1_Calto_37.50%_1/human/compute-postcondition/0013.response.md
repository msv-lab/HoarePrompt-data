Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is the sum of `n` + 1 and the terms (`n` - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + 1 for i from 2 to m-1, `i` is m-1, `x` is `n` - ((m-1) * (m-1) - (m-1)), `y` is (m-1) * (m-1), and `m` must be greater than 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6.
- **`cnt`**: This variable accumulates a value that starts from `n` + 1. For each iteration from `i = 2` to `i = m-1`, it adds the result of the expression `(`n` - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + 1`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `m-1`.
- **`x`**: The final value of `x` will be `n` - ((m-1) * (m-1) - (m-1)).
- **`y`**: The final value of `y` will be (m-1) * (m-1).
- **`m`**: The loop will only execute if `m` is greater than 1. If `m` is 1, the loop will not run at all.
