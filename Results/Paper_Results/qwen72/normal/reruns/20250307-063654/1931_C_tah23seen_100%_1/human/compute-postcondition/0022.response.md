Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a non-negative integer. It calculates the maximum value between 0 and a difference based on the indices of specific elements in the list. Specifically, it returns the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1) if the first and last elements of `arr` are equal, or the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1, j) otherwise. Here, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j > 0`, or 0 if no such index exists; and `n` is the length of `arr`. **
