The variables in the loop head are `j` and the condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is greater than 0 and that `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is `n - 3`.
- `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` is true.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be greater than 0.
- `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` must still be true.

Given that `j` is `n - 3` and `n` must be greater than 2, `j` can be at most `n - 3`. For `j` to be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3. Additionally, `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` must still hold true.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `j` is greater than 0 and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` remains true. Since `j` is `n - 3`, we need `n` to be greater than 3.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 3; `j` is `n - 3` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.**
