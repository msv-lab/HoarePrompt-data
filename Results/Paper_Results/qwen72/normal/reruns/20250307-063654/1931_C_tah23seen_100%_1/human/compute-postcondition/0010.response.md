To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

1. **Condition `j > 0`:** 
   - `j` is defined as `n - 1`. For `j` to be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is the length of `arr` and `1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5`, `n` can indeed be greater than 1. Therefore, `j` can be greater than 0 if `n` is at least 2.

2. **Condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`:**
   - This condition checks if the last element in `arr` is equal to the second-to-last element. For this to be true, `arr` must have at least two elements, and the last two elements must be equal.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once:
- `n` must be greater than 1 (so `j` is greater than 0).
- The last two elements of `arr` must be equal (`arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`).

Since `n` is already defined to be the length of `arr` and `1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5`, we only need to ensure that `arr` has at least two elements and that the last two elements are equal.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`; `j` is `n - 1` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**
