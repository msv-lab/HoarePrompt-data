Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 3; `j` is `n - 4` and `arr[j + 1] == arr[j]`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Initially, `j` was `n - 3`, so after the decrement, `j` becomes `n - 4`. The condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` is no longer directly applicable, but `arr[j + 1] == arr[j]` (which is equivalent to `arr[n - 3] == arr[n - 4]`) still holds true. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
