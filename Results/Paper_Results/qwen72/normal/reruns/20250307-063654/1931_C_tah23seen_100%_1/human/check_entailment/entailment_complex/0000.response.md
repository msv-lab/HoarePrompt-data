### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Loop Structure:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the array `arr` and the result is printed.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - It then enters a loop to find the first index `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This loop increments `i` until it finds such an index or reaches the end of the array.
   - Similarly, it enters another loop to find the last index `j` where `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]`. This loop decrements `j` until it finds such an index or reaches the beginning of the array.
   - After these loops, `i` and `j` are set to the indices of the first and last elements that are not equal to their adjacent elements, respectively.

3. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), the function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This is correct because if the first and last elements are equal, we can potentially make the entire array equal by assigning the value of the first element to the segment between `i` and `j` (excluding the endpoints), which costs `j - i - 1` burles. If `j - i - 1` is negative, it returns 0, which is correct because no operation is needed if the array is already equal.

4. **General Case Handling:**
   - If the first and last elements are not equal, the function returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This is correct because:
     - `n - i - 1` represents the cost of making all elements from `i + 1` to the end of the array equal to `arr[0]`.
     - `j` represents the cost of making all elements from the beginning of the array to `j - 1` equal to `arr[-1]`.
     - The minimum of these two costs is the optimal choice to make the entire array equal with the least burles. If the minimum cost is negative, it returns 0, which is correct because no operation is needed if the array is already equal.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements in the array are equal, the loops will set `i` to `len(arr) - 1` and `j` to 0, and the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - If the array has only one element, the loops will not change `i` and `j`, and the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - If the array has two elements and they are not equal, the function will return 1, which is correct because we need to assign one element to the other.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and edge cases. It efficiently finds the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by considering the first and last elements and the segments where the elements are not equal.

Correctness: **True**
