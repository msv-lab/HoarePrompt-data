Output State: **The program returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (`n - i - 1`, `j`), where `n` is the length of `arr`, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal, and `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j > 0`, or 0 if no such index exists.**
