To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Description:
- We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
- We can apply an operation to select three integers `i`, `j`, `x` (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and assign all elements of the array with indices from `i` to `j` the value `x`. The price of this operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles.
- The goal is to find the least amount of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the elements are equal.
   - Similarly, it moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the elements are equal.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), it returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

### Reasoning:
1. **Case 1: All elements are already equal:**
   - If all elements in the array are already equal, no operation is needed, and the cost is 0.
   - The program correctly handles this case by returning 0 when `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and the array is already uniform.

2. **Case 2: The array has a segment of equal elements at the start and end:**
   - If the array has a segment of equal elements at the start and end, the program correctly identifies the segment and calculates the cost to make the remaining elements equal.
   - The cost is calculated as `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which is the length of the segment that needs to be changed minus one, ensuring that the cost is non-negative.

3. **Case 3: The array does not have equal elements at the start and end:**
   - If the array does not have equal elements at the start and end, the program calculates the cost to make the entire array equal by either:
     - Changing the elements from the start to the end of the array.
     - Changing the elements from the end to the start of the array.
   - The cost is calculated as `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`, which is the minimum of the two possible segments to change, ensuring that the cost is non-negative.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Input:**
  ```
  8
  6
  1 2 3 4 5 1
  7
  1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  8
  8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
  1
  1
  2
  1 2
  3
  1 2 3
  7
  4 3 2 7 1 1 3
  9
  9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  4
  0
  2
  0
  1
  2
  6
  7
  ```

### Verification:
- For the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program correctly identifies that the first and last elements are equal, and the cost to make the middle segment equal is `4` burles.
- For the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program correctly returns `0` since all elements are already equal.
- For the array `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`, the program correctly identifies the segments and returns `2` burles.
- For the array `[1]`, the program correctly returns `0` since the array has only one element.
- For the array `[1, 2]`, the program correctly returns `1` burle.
- For the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the program correctly returns `2` burles.
- For the array `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`, the program correctly returns `6` burles.
- For the array `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`, the program correctly returns `7` burles.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
