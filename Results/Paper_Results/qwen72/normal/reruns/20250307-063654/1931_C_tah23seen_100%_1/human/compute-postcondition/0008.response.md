Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 3; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 3; `j` is `n - 1`; `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 3.
- The values of `arr`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]` is still valid.
- The length of `arr` (`n`) is still greater than 3.
