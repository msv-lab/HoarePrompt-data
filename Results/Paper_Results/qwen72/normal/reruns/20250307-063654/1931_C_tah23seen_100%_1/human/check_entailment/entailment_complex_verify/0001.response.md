### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the elements are equal.
   - Similarly, it moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the elements are equal.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), it returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: All elements are already equal:**
     - If all elements in the array are already equal, the program correctly returns `0` because no operation is needed.
     - This is handled by the condition `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and the fact that `i` and `j` will both be `0` or `len(arr) - 1`.

   - **Case 2: The array has a segment of equal elements at the start and end:**
     - If the array has a segment of equal elements at the start and end, the program correctly identifies the segment and calculates the cost to make the remaining elements equal.
     - The cost is calculated as `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which is the length of the segment that needs to be changed minus one, ensuring that the cost is non-negative.
     - This is correct because the segment from `i` to `j` (inclusive) needs to be changed to match the equal elements at the start and end.

   - **Case 3: The array does not have equal elements at the start and end:**
     - If the array does not have equal elements at the start and end, the program calculates the cost to make the entire array equal by either:
       - Changing the elements from the start to the end of the array.
       - Changing the elements from the end to the start of the array.
     - The cost is calculated as `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`, which is the minimum of the two possible segments to change, ensuring that the cost is non-negative.
     - This is correct because the minimum cost will be the smaller of the two segments: from the start to the end of the array or from the end to the start of the array.

4. **Example Test Cases:**
   - **Input:**
     ```
     8
     6
     1 2 3 4 5 1
     7
     1 1 1 1 1 1 1
     8
     8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
     1
     1
     2
     1 2
     3
     1 2 3
     7
     4 3 2 7 1 1 3
     9
     9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
     ```
   - **Expected Output:**
     ```
     4
     0
     2
     0
     1
     2
     6
     7
     ```
   - **Actual Output:**
     - For `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program returns `4` burles, which is correct.
     - For `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program returns `0` burles, which is correct.
     - For `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`, the program returns `2` burles, which is correct.
     - For `[1]`, the program returns `0` burles, which is correct.
     - For `[1, 2]`, the program returns `1` burle, which is correct.
     - For `[1, 2, 3]`, the program returns `2` burles, which is correct.
     - For `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`, the program returns `6` burles, which is correct.
     - For `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`, the program returns `7` burles, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
