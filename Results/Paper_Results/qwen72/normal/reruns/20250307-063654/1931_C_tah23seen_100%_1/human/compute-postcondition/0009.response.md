Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`; `j` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop will continue to increment `i` as long as the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element.
- If all elements in `arr` are equal, `i` will be `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last index of the list.
- The length of `arr` (`n`) must be at least `i + 1` to ensure that the loop condition `i < len(arr) - 1` can be satisfied.
- The variable `j` remains unchanged and is still `n - 1`.
