To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `i < len(arr) - 1`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `len(arr)` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 2.
   - Therefore, `len(arr) - 1` is `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3 for `i` to be less than `n - 1`.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop can execute one more time if `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 3, and `arr[2]` is equal to `arr[3]`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 2; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 3; `j` is `n - 1`; `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`**
