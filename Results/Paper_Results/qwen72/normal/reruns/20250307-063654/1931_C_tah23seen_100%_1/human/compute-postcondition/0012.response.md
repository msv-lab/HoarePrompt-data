The variables in the loop head are `j` and the condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is greater than 0 and that `arr[j]` is still equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is `n - 2`
- `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` is true

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than 0, and `arr[j]` must still be equal to `arr[j - 1]`. Since `j` is `n - 2`, for `j` to be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2. Additionally, the condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` must remain true.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 2.
- `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` must remain true.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 2; `j` is `n - 2` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**
