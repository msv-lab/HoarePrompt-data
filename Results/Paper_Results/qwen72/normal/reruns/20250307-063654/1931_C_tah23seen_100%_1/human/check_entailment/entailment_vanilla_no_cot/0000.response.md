Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where all elements in the array are already equal. For such cases, the output should be `0` burles, but the program does not explicitly check for this condition.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Burles Calculation**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function attempts to find the longest contiguous segment of equal elements at the beginning and the end of the array, but it does not correctly calculate the minimum burles required to make all elements equal.

3. **Handling Different Values**: The program does not consider the possibility that the optimal solution might involve setting all elements to a value that is not at the beginning or the end of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider the following steps:

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Element**: Determine the most frequent element in the array.
2. **Calculate the Minimum Cost**: The minimum cost to make all elements equal is the length of the array minus the frequency of the most frequent element. This is because you can set all other elements to the most frequent element in one operation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) from x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(arr)
    max_freq = max(freq.values())
    return n - max_freq
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by finding the most frequent element and determining the cost to set all other elements to this value.
