Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`; `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j > 0`, or `j` is 0 if no such index exists.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be the largest index in the list `arr` where the element at `j` is equal to the element at `j - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0. If no such index exists (i.e., all elements are unique or the first element is different from the second), `j` will be 0. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
