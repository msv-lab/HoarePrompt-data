The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and the length of `arr`.

**Case_1:** The function returns the maximum value between 0 and (j - i - 1), where `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j > 0`, or `j` is 0 if no such index exists. `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.

**Case_2:** The function returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (`n - i - 1`, `j`), where `n` is the length of `arr`, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal, and `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j > 0`, or 0 if no such index exists.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the maximum value between 0 and a calculated difference based on the indices of specific elements in the list. If there is a largest index `j` where the element is equal to its previous element and a first index `i` where the element is not equal to its next element, it returns the maximum of 0 and (j - i - 1). If no such indices are found, it returns the maximum of 0 and the minimum of (`n - i - 1`, `j`), where `n` is the length of the list, `i` is the index of the first element not equal to its next, and `j` is the largest index where the element is equal to its previous.**
