Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`; `j` is `n - 2` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` is now `n - 2`.
- The condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` still holds true, as the decrement of `j` by 1 does not affect the equality of the elements in `arr`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
