Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `n` is the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`; `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j > 0`, or `j` is 0 if no such index exists. Additionally, the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`.**
