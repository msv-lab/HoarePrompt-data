You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Description:
- We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
- We can apply an operation to select three integers `i`, `j`, `x` (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and assign all elements of the array with indices from `i` to `j` the value `x`. The price of this operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles.
- The goal is to find the least amount of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then moves the pointer `i` to the right as long as the elements are equal.
   - Similarly, it moves the pointer `j` to the left as long as the elements are equal.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), it returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

### Reasoning:
1. **Case 1: All elements are already equal:**
   - If all elements in the array are already equal, no operation is needed, and the cost is 0.
   - The program correctly handles this case by returning 0 when `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and the array is already uniform.

2. **Case 2: The array has a segment of equal elements at the start and end:**
   - If the array has a segment of equal elements at the start and end, the program correctly identifies the segment and calculates the cost to make the remaining elements equal.
   - The cost is calculated as `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which is the length of the segment that needs to be changed minus one, ensuring that the cost is non-negative.

3. **Case 3: The array does not have equal elements at the start and end:**
   - If the array does not have equal elements at the start and end, the program calculates the cost to make the entire array equal by either:
     - Changing the elements from the start to the end of the array.
     - Changing the elements from the end to the start of the array.
   - The cost is calculated as `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`, which is the minimum of the two possible segments to change, ensuring that the cost is non-negative.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Input:**
  ```
  8
  6
  1 2 3 4 5 1
  7
  1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  8
  8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
  1
  1
  2
  1 2
  3
  1 2 3
  7
  4 3 2 7 1 1 3
  9
  9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  4
  0
  2
  0
  1
  2
  6
  7
  ```

### Verification:
- For the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program correctly identifies that the first and last elements are equal, and the cost to make the middle segment equal is `4` burles.
- For the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program correctly returns `0` since all elements are already equal.
- For the array `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`, the program correctly identifies the segments and returns `2` burles.
- For the array `[1]`, the program correctly returns `0` since the array has only one element.
- For the array `[1, 2]`, the program correctly returns `1` burle.
- For the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the program correctly returns `2` burles.
- For the array `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`, the program correctly returns `6` burles.
- For the array `[9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3]`, the program correctly returns `7` burles.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
