Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between 0 and (j - i - 1), where `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` and `j > 0`, or `j` is 0 if no such index exists, and `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to its next element, or `i` is `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.**

In simpler terms, the program returns the length of the longest contiguous segment of equal elements in `arr` that starts after the first element that is different from its next element, minus one. If there is no such segment, or if the segment length is less than or equal to zero, the program returns 0.
