Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal using a single operation that assigns a value to a range of elements, with the cost being the length of the range. The program provided uses a strategy to identify the longest possible segment that can be made equal at the minimum cost by checking the edges of the array.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the array is already uniform (all elements are the same), the cost is 0. This is handled by checking if `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and all intermediate elements are also equal.

3. **Finding the Range**:
   - The program finds the first index `i` from the start where the element is different from the next one.
   - It also finds the last index `j` from the end where the element is different from the previous one.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the first and last elements are the same, the program calculates the cost as `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which is the length of the segment between the first and last differing elements, minus one.
   - If the first and last elements are different, the program calculates the cost as `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`, which is the minimum of the length of the segment from the first differing element to the end and the length of the segment from the start to the last differing element.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The cost calculation when the first and last elements are different should consider the entire segment that needs to be changed, not just the minimum of the two segments. The correct approach should be to find the minimum cost to make the entire array equal by either:
- Changing the segment from the first differing element to the end.
- Changing the segment from the start to the last differing element.
- Changing the entire array if the first and last elements are different.

The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where the first and last elements are different and the optimal solution involves changing the entire array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
