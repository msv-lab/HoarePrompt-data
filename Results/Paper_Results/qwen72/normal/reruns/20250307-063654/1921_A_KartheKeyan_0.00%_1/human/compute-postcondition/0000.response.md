Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be modified to accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is at least one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. The variable `n` is set to the input integer, and the loop runs `n` times. In each iteration, the variable `l` is set to the input integer, `s` is calculated as `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`, and `s` is printed. After each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1.**
