The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the range defined by `4`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and it must still be less than 4.

State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)` and the newly appended tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the sorted `coord` list, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the sorted `coord` list.**
