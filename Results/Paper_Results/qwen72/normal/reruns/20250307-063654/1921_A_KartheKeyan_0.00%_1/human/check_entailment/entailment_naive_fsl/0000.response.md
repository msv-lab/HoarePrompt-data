Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in every potential case. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the distances between the points. The program assumes that the second point in the sorted list is adjacent to the first point and the last point is adjacent to the third point, which is not always true. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the side length of the square.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1
1 3
3 1
3 3
```
The correct area of the square is 4, but the program will output a different value because the points are not correctly identified as adjacent sides of the square. The correct approach would be to find the unique x and y coordinates and calculate the side length as the difference between the unique x or y values.
