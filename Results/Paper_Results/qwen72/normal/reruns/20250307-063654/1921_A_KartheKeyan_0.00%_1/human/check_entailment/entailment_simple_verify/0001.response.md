### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then reads the coordinates of the four corners for each test case and stores them in the list `coord`.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The program sorts the list of coordinates. Sorting the coordinates is a good approach because it helps in identifying the side lengths of the square. However, the sorting should be done in a way that ensures the coordinates are aligned properly for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - The sorted list `coord` will have the coordinates in the order of increasing x-coordinates and y-coordinates. For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the sorted coordinates will be in the form: (x1, y1), (x1, y2), (x2, y1), (x2, y2).

3. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between the first and second points (`p1`) and between the third and fourth points (`p2`).
   - These distances are intended to represent the side lengths of the square. However, the way the distances are calculated is not correct for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be found by:
     - Taking the difference between the x-coordinates of the first and second points.
     - Taking the difference between the y-coordinates of the first and third points.
   - The program should use one of these differences to find the side length, not both.

4. **Calculating Area:**
   - The program calculates the area as `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the product of the distances between two pairs of points gives the area, which is not true for a square.
   - The correct way to find the area of a square is to take the side length and square it. Since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be found by taking the difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent points.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        coord = sorted(coord)
        
        # Calculate the side length
        side_length = coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the area calculation. The program uses an incorrect method to calculate the area of the square. The correct method should involve finding the side length and then squaring it.

Final: **False**
