The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range defined by `4`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute 4 times regardless of the values of `n`, `func`, `coord`, and `res` because the range is fixed at 4. However, to ensure the loop starts correctly, `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
