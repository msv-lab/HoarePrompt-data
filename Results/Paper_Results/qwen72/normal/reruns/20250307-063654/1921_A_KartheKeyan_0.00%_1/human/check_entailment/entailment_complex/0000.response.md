Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given its corner coordinates. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Sorting Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, which can lead to incorrect results. Sorting the coordinates does not guarantee that the points will be in the correct order to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For a square with sides parallel to the axes, the correct approach is to identify the unique x and y values and use them to calculate the side length.

2. **Calculation of Area**: The program calculates `p1` and `p2` as the squared distances between specific pairs of coordinates. However, for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be directly derived by finding the difference between the unique x or y values. The program's approach to calculating the area using the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2` is overly complicated and incorrect.

3. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the coordinates for each test case. However, the function should be modified to accept a list of test cases as input, as mentioned in the comments.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, but the result is not the correct area of the square.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Read the coordinates.
- Identify the unique x and y values.
- Calculate the side length of the square as the difference between the unique x or y values.
- Compute the area as the square of the side length.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
