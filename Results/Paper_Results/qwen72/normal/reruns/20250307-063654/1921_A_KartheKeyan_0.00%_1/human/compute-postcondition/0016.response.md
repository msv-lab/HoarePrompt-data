Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)` representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the `coord` list.**

Explanation:
- `p1` is calculated as the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the `coord` list.
- The value of `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `func`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
