Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `func` is a function that takes a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
   - `coord` is a sorted list of the tuples `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`.
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user.
   - `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the sorted `coord` list.
   - `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the sorted `coord` list.
   - `n` is now `n - 1` and must be greater than 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `coord` is a sorted list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
   - `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the sorted `coord` list.
   - `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the sorted `coord` list.
   - `res` is calculated as the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

3. **Calculating `p1` and `p2`:**
   - Since `coord` is a sorted list of coordinates of a square, the first and second coordinates will be adjacent corners of the square, and the third and fourth coordinates will also be adjacent corners.
   - The squared distance between two adjacent corners of a square with side length `s` is `s^2`.
   - Therefore, `p1` and `p2` will both be equal to `s^2`, where `s` is the side length of the square.

4. **Calculating `res`:**
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - Since `p1` and `p2` are both `s^2`, the square roots of `p1` and `p2` are both `s`.
   - The product of `s` and `s` is `s^2`.
   - The absolute value of `s^2` is `s^2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the side length of the square squared.

Given the initial state and the calculations, the output will be the side length of the square squared.

Output: **s^2 (where s is the side length of the square formed by the coordinates in the `coord` list)**
