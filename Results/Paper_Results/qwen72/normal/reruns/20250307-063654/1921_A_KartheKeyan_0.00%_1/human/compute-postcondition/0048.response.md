Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)` and the newly appended tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the sorted `coord` list, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the sorted `coord` list.**

In natural language: The initial state remains mostly unchanged, except that the list `coord` now contains the tuple `(x, y)` twice. The values of `x` and `y` are still the input integers provided by the user. The values of `n`, `func`, `res`, and `i` remain the same. The squared distances `p1` and `p2` are still calculated based on the sorted `coord` list, but now `coord` includes the new tuple.
