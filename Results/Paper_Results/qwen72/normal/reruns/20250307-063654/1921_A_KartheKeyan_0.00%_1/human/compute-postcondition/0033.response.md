Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the `coord` list, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the `coord` list, and `n` is now `n - 1` and must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs 4 times, and each time it appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`.
- After 4 iterations, `coord` will contain 4 tuples: `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`.
- The variable `i` will be 3 after the loop completes its 4 iterations.
- The variables `x` and `y` will be updated to the input integers provided by the user for the last iteration.
- The variables `p1` and `p2` are still described as the squared distances between the first and second coordinates, and the third and fourth coordinates in the `coord` list, respectively.
- The variable `n` is decremented by 1 after the loop completes, and it must still be greater than 0.
