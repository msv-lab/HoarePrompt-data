Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Sorting Coordinates**: Sorting the coordinates does not guarantee that the points are in the correct order to form a square. The coordinates of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes should be processed in a way that ensures the correct side lengths are calculated.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the distances between points using the Euclidean distance formula, but it does not correctly identify the side length of the square. For a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by the difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent points.

3. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is calculated incorrectly. The area should be the side length squared, but the program is taking the square root of the distances and then multiplying them, which is not the correct approach.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set(point[0] for point in coord))
        y_coords = sorted(set(point[1] for point in coord))
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = abs(x_coords[1] - x_coords[0])
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Extract Unique Coordinates**: The program extracts unique x and y coordinates from the given points. Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by the difference between the two unique x-coordinates or y-coordinates.

2. **Calculate Side Length**: The side length is calculated as the absolute difference between the two unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).

3. **Calculate Area**: The area of the square is then calculated as the side length squared.

This corrected program will correctly compute the area of the square for the given test cases.
