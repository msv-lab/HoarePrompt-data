Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)` representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user.**

The coordinates in the `coord` list are now sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple (x-coordinate). If the x-coordinates are the same, they are sorted based on the second element (y-coordinate). The values of `n`, `func`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
