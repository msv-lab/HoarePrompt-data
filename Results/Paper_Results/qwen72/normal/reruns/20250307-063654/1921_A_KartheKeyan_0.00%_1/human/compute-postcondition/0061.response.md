Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers (coordinates) from the user, sorts these coordinates, and calculates a value `res` based on the squared distances between specific pairs of coordinates. The function then prints `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `n` being 0. The function does not return any value. **
