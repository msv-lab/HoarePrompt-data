Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the sorted `coord` list, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the sorted `coord` list.**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `coord` was initially an empty list, it now contains the tuple `(x, y)`. The values of `n`, `func`, `res`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The variables `p1` and `p2` are still defined based on the sorted `coord` list, but the list currently only contains one tuple, so these variables will not be updated until more tuples are added to `coord`.
