Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `(x, y)` and the newly appended tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the `coord` list, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the `coord` list, and `n` is now `n - 1` and must be greater than 0.**

The code `coord.append((x, y))` appends the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user, the new tuple `(x, y)` is added to the end of `coord`. The values of `n`, `func`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
