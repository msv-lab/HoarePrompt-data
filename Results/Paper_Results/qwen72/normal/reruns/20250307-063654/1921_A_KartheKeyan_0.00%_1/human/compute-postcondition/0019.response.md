Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
3. `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)` representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
4. `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
5. `i` is 3.
6. `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user.
7. `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the `coord` list.
8. `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the `coord` list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(res)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`coord` List**: This list contains four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. Since it is sorted, we can assume the coordinates are ordered in a way that makes sense for a square (e.g., bottom-left, bottom-right, top-right, top-left).

2. **`p1` Calculation**: `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the `coord` list. For a square, the distance between adjacent corners (e.g., bottom-left to bottom-right) is the side length of the square. Let's denote the side length of the square as `s`. Therefore, `p1` is `s^2`.

3. **`p2` Calculation**: `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the `coord` list. Similarly, for a square, the distance between adjacent corners (e.g., top-right to top-left) is the side length of the square. Therefore, `p2` is also `s^2`.

4. **`res` Calculation**: `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. Since `p1` and `p2` are both `s^2`, the square roots of `p1` and `p2` are both `s`. Therefore, `res` is `|s * s| = s^2`.

### Final Output:
The `print(res)` statement will print the squared side length of the square formed by the coordinates in the `coord` list.

Output: **s^2 (where s is the side length of the square formed by the coordinates in the `coord` list)**
