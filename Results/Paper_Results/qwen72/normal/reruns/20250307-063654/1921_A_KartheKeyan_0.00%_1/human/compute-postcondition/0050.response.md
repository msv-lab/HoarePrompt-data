The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `x` and `y` to the integers provided by the user. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)` and the newly appended tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the sorted `coord` list, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the sorted `coord` list.**
