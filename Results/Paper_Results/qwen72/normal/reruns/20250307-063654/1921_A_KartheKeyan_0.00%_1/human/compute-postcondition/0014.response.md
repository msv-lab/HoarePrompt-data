Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `(x, y)` representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all 4 iterations, the variable `coord` will contain a list of four tuples, each representing the coordinates of a corner of a square. The values of `n` and `func` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `res` is still 0, and `i` is 3, which is the last index of the loop. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the last set of input integers provided by the user.
