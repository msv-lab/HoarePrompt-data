Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user.**

The tuple `(x, y)` has been appended to the list `coord`. The values of `n`, `func`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are the input integers provided by the user.
