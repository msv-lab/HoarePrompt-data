The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the range `4`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are input integers.**
