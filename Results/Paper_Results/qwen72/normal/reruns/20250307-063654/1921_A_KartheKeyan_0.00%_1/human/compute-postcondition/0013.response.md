Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)` and the new tuple `(x, y)` appended to it, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user.**

In natural language: The initial state is mostly unchanged, except that the list `coord` now contains an additional tuple `(x, y)` that was appended to it. The values of `x` and `y` were updated to the input integers provided by the user, and this new tuple is added to `coord`. The other variables (`n`, `func`, `res`, and `i`) remain the same.
