You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers (coordinates) from the user, sorts these coordinates, and calculates a value `res` based on the squared distances between specific pairs of coordinates. The function then prints `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `n` being 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in every potential case. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the distances between the points. The program assumes that the second point in the sorted list is adjacent to the first point and the last point is adjacent to the third point, which is not always true. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the side length of the square.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1
1 3
3 1
3 3
```
The correct area of the square is 4, but the program will output a different value because the points are not correctly identified as adjacent sides of the square. The correct approach would be to find the unique x and y coordinates and calculate the side length as the difference between the unique x or y values.
