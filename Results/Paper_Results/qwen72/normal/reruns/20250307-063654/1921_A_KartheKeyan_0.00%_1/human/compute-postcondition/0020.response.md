Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a sorted list containing four tuples `(x, y)` representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the `coord` list, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the `coord` list, and `n` is now `n - 1`.**
