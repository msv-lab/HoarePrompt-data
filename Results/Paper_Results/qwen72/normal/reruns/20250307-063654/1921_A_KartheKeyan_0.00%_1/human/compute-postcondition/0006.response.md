Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are input integers.**

The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the user input, which is split into two integers. The other variables (`n`, `func`, `coord`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
