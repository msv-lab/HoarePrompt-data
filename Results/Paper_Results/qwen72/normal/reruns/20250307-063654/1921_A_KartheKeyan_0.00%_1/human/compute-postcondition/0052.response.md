Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `(x, y)` appended in the order they were input, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the sorted `coord` list, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the sorted `coord` list.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all 4 iterations, the variable `coord` will contain a list of four tuples, each representing the coordinates `(x, y)` that were input by the user in the order they were provided. The variable `i` will be 3, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last input coordinates. The variables `p1` and `p2` will still be defined as the squared distances between the first and second coordinates, and the third and fourth coordinates, respectively, in the sorted `coord` list. The variable `res` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
