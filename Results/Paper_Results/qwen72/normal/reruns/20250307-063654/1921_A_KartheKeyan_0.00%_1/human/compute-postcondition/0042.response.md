Output State: **`n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 0, `func` is expected to take a list of test cases where each test case is a list of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers provided by the user, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second coordinates in the sorted `coord` list, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth coordinates in the sorted `coord` list.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `res` was the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
- The code snippet `res = 0` sets `res` to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `func`, `coord`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
