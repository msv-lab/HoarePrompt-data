Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, the list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `num` is an input string, `out` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `out`. The values of `t`, `n`, the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`, and the input string `num` remain unchanged.
