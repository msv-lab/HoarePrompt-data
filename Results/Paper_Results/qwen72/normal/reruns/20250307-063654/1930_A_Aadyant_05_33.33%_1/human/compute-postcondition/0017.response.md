The code snippet `out.append(sum(list2))` appends the sum of the elements in `list2` to the list `out`. The elements in `list2` are the first, third, fifth, ..., and (2 * a - 1)-th elements from `list1`, which is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by spaces. The value of `a` is the integer value of the input string `num`, and `i` is `a - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50
- The list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7
- `num` is an input string such that `int(num)` is greater than 0
- `out` is an empty list
- `numbers` is 0
- `list2` contains the integer values of the first, third, fifth, ..., and (2 * a - 1)-th elements in `list1`
- `list1` is now a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by spaces
- `a` is the integer value of the input string `num`
- `b` is an input string
- `i` is `a - 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `out` now contains a single element, which is the sum of the elements in `list2`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, the list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `num` is an input string such that `int(num)` is greater than 0, `out` is a list containing the sum of the elements in `list2`, `numbers` is 0, `list2` contains the integer values of the first, third, fifth, ..., and (2 * a - 1)-th elements in `list1`, `list1` is now a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by spaces, `a` is the integer value of the input string `num`, `b` is an input string, `i` is `a - 1`.**
