Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, the list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `num` is an input string such that `int(num)` is greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `list2` contains the integer value of the first element in `list1`, the integer value of the third element in `list1`, and the integer value of the fifth element in `list1`, `list1` is now a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by spaces, `a` is the integer value of the input string `num` and must be greater than 2, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2.**
