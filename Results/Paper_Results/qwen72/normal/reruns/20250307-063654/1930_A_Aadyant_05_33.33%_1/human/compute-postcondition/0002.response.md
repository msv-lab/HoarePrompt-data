To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `numbers` and the result of `int(num)`.

1. **`numbers`**: This variable is initialized by the loop and will start from 0.
2. **`int(num)`**: This determines the number of times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(num)` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50
- The list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7
- `num` is an input string
- `out` is an empty list

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `num`. Specifically, `int(num)` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, the list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `num` is an input string such that `int(num)` is greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0**
