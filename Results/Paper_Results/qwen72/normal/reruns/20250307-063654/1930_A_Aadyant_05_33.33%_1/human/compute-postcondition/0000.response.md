Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, the list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, and `num` is an input string.**

The code snippet `num = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `num`. Since the input is not specified, `num` is now a string containing whatever the user provided. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
