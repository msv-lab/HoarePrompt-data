The code snippet `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1` in ascending order. The other variables and their values remain unchanged. The specific values of `t`, `n`, `a_i` (where 1 <= i <= 2n), `num`, `out`, `numbers`, `list2`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, the list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `num` is an input string such that `int(num)` is greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is now a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by spaces, `a` is the integer value of the input string `num`, `b` is an input string.**
