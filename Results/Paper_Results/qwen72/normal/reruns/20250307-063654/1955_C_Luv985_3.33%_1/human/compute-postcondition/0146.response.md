Output State: **`n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is an integer representing the number of elements in the original `a` that have been reduced to 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is increased by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to the original `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `l` is not equal to `r`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
