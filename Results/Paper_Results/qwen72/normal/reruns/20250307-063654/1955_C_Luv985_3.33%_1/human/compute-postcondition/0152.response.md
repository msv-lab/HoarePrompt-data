Output State: **`n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is now `a[n - 1] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 1]`) is updated by subtracting `mi` from it.
- The value of `mi` remains the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` before the subtraction.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
