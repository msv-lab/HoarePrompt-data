Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2` and `ans` is 1. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, if `mi * 2 > k`, `k` is updated to `k % 2`, `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
