Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and the current value of `mi` is such that `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
