Output State: **`t` is the result of `k % 2`, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is now `ans + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
