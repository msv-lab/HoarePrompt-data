Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1 (depending on whether `a[0]` was 0), `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (depending on whether `a[n - 1]` was 0), `ans` is 0 or 1 (depending on whether `a[0]` or `a[n - 1]` was 0 or whether `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `k % 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
