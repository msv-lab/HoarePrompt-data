Output State: **`n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is now `a[n - 1] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `T`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The values of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are updated to `a[0] - mi` and `a[n - 1] - mi`, respectively.
- The precondition that `n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` remains valid.
