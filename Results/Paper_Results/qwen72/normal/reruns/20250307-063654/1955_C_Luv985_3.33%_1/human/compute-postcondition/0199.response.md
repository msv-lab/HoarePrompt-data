Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `mi - t - k // 2 == 0` or not, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
