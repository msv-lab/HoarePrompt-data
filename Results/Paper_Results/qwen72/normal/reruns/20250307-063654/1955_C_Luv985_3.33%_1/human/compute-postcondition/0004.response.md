Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` are input strings, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, k = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two strings, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The other variables (`t`, `T`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` and `k` are now input strings, while the rest of the initial state remains valid.
