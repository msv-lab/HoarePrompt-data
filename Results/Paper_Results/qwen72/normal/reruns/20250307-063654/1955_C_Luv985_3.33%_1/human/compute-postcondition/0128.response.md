Output State: **`t` is `k % 2`, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` and must be greater than `l`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is now the remainder of `k` divided by 2, which means `t` can be 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd.
- The values of `T`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `n`, and `mi` remain unchanged from their initial states.
