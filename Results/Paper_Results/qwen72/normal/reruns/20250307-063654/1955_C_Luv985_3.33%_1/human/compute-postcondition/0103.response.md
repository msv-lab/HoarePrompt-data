Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[0]` is decremented by `mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`.
- The values of `t`, `T`, `k`, `a` (except for `a[0]`), `l`, `r`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The value of `mi` is still the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` before the decrement.
