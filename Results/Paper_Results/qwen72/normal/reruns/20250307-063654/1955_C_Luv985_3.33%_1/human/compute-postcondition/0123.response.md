Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - 2 * mi` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1 or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` and must be greater than `l`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the execution of the code.**

Explanation:
- `l` is incremented by 1, so if `l` was 0, it is now 1, and if `l` was 1, it is now 2.
- The other variables (`t`, `T`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `ans`, `n`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `mi`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
