Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is an integer such that `0 ≤ l ≤ n - 1`, `r` is an integer such that `0 ≤ r ≤ n - 1` and `l` ≤ `r`, `ans` is an integer representing the number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, and `l` is equal to `r`.**
