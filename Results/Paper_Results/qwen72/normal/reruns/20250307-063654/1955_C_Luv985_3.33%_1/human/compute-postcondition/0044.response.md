Output State: **`t` is the result of `k % 2`, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is now the remainder of `k` divided by 2, which means `t` is either 0 or 1.
- The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `mi` remain unchanged from their initial state.
