Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is now `n - 2` and `ans` is now `ans + 1`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is now 1 and `ans` is now `ans + 1`. Otherwise, if `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is the result of `k % 2`, `k` remains greater than 0, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is now `ans + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
