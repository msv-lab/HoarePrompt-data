The code snippet `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each string in the list `a` to an integer. This transformation affects the type of elements in `a`, but does not change the values of `t`, `T`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers.**
