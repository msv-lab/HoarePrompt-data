Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now `k - mi * 2` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is now 1, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - mi`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n-1]`) is 0.**
