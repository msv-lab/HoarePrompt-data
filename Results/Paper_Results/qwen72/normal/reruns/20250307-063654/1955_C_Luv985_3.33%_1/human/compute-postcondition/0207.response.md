The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, representing the size of the list `a` and a specific integer value, respectively.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the list.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. It processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` (the size of the list `a`), an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`.**
