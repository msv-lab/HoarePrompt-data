The code snippet `a = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and assigns the resulting list of strings to the variable `a`. This changes the type of `a` from a list of integers to a list of strings.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of strings, `l` is an integer such that `0 ≤ l ≤ n - 1`, `r` is an integer such that `0 ≤ r ≤ n - 1` and `l` ≤ `r`, `ans` is an integer representing the number of elements in the original `a` that have been reduced to 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is increased by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to the original `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `l` is not equal to `r`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
