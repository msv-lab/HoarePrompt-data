Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of strings representing integers.**

The code `a = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, where each string represents an integer. The values of `t`, `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
