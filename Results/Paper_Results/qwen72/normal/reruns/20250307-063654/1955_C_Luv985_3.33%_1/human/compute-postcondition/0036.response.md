Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[r]` (which is `a[n-1]`) is updated by subtracting `mi` from it.
- The value of `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` before the update.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
