Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - 2 * mi` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `T`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `ans`, `n`, `mi`, `a[0]`, `a[r]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
