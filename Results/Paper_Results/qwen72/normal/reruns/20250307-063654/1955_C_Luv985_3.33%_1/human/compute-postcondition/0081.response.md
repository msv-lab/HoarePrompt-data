Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is now an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is now an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`.** 

The value of `mi` is set to the minimum of the first element (`a[0]`) and the last element (`a[n - 1]`) of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
