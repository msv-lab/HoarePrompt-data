Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` and must be greater than `l`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the execution of the code.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the minimum value `mi` from the element at index `r` in the list `a`.
- The value of `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the execution of the code.
- The initial state specifies that `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi` after the execution of the code.
- After executing `a[r] -= mi`, the value of `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`.
- All other variables (`t`, `T`, `k`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `n`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `r` must be greater than `l` and `T` must be greater than 0 still holds true.
