Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is now an integer (converted from the input string), `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is now an integer.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is now an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2` and must be greater than 0, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, and `a[r + 1]` is 0. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `ans` is 2, and the first element of `a` (`a[l]`) is 0. Otherwise, if `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2` and `ans` is 1 or 2. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, if `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to the remainder of `k` divided by 2, and `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` and must be greater than `l`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the execution of the code. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi` and must be greater than 0, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1 or 2 and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` and `ans` is 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2`. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, `k` remains an integer and must be greater than 0, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
