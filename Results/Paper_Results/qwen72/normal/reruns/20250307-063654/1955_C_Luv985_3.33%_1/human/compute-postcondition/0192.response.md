Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`. If `a[l]` (which is `a[0]`) is 0, then `l` is updated to 1, `ans` is updated to 1.***
