Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is now `1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - mi`, `ans` is now `ans + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged based on the initial conditions provided.
