Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, while the values of `t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state.
