The provided Python code snippet consists of comments and does not contain any executable code that modifies the variables or state. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
