Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - mi * 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[r + 1]` is 0. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `ans` is 2, and the first element of `a` (`a[l]`) is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` is now `n - 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
