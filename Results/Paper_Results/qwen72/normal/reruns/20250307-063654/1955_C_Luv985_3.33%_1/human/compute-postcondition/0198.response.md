Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
