Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2` and `ans` is 1 or 2. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, if `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to the remainder of `k` divided by 2, and `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.***
