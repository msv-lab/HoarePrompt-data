You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains an integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - Each test case consists of:
     - Two integers `n` and `k` (number of ships and number of Kraken attacks).
     - A list of `n` integers `a` representing the durability of each ship.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.

3. **Kraken Attack Pattern:**
   - The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship.
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
   - If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is no longer attacked.
   - The Kraken continues attacking until either all ships have sunk or it has made `k` attacks.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `l` is initialized to 0, representing the index of the first ship.
   - `r` is initialized to `n - 1`, representing the index of the last ship.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0, representing the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `k > 0`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ship (`mi`).
   - If `mi * 2 <= k`, it means the Kraken can attack both ships enough times to reduce their durability by `mi`:
     - It reduces the durability of both ships by `mi`.
     - It reduces `k` by `2 * mi`.
     - If the first ship's durability drops to 0, it increments `ans` and moves the left pointer `l` to the next ship.
     - If the last ship's durability drops to 0, it increments `ans` and moves the right pointer `r` to the previous ship.
   - If `mi * 2 > k`, it means the Kraken can only partially attack the ships:
     - It calculates the remaining attacks `t = k % 2`.
     - It checks if the remaining attacks can sink one of the ships.
     - If the remaining attacks can sink a ship, it increments `ans` and breaks the loop.

4. **Final Check:**
   - If `l == r`, it means there is only one ship left.
   - It checks if the remaining attacks `k` are enough to sink the last remaining ship and increments `ans` if so.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of ships sunk for each test case.

### Edge Cases:
- **All ships sink before `k` attacks are completed:**
  - The program correctly handles this by breaking the loop when `l` and `r` meet or cross each other.
- **`k` is less than the total number of attacks needed to sink all ships:**
  - The program correctly handles this by stopping the loop when `k` reaches 0.
- **Single ship remaining:**
  - The program correctly handles this by checking if the remaining attacks can sink the last ship.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Input:**
   - `4 5`
   - `1 2 4 3`
   - **Output:**
     - `2`
   - **Reasoning:**
     - First attack: `a = [0, 2, 4, 3]` (ship 1 sinks)
     - Second attack: `a = [2, 4, 2]`
     - Third attack: `a = [1, 4, 2]`
     - Fourth attack: `a = [1, 4, 1]`
     - Fifth attack: `a = [0, 4, 1]` (ship 1 sinks again)
     - Two ships are sunk.

2. **Input:**
   - `4 6`
   - `1 2 4 3`
   - **Output:**
     - `3`
   - **Reasoning:**
     - First attack: `a = [0, 2, 4, 3]` (ship 1 sinks)
     - Second attack: `a = [2, 4, 2]`
     - Third attack: `a = [1, 4, 2]`
     - Fourth attack: `a = [1, 4, 1]`
     - Fifth attack: `a = [0, 4, 1]` (ship 1 sinks again)
     - Sixth attack: `a = [4, 0]` (ship 4 sinks)
     - Three ships are sunk.

3. **Input:**
   - `5 20`
   - `2 7 1 8 2`
   - **Output:**
     - `5`
   - **Reasoning:**
     - The Kraken will attack the ships in the pattern: 1, 5, 1, 5, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3.
     - All ships will eventually sink.

4. **Input:**
   - `2 2`
   - `3 2`
   - **Output:**
     - `0`
   - **Reasoning:**
     - The Kraken attacks the first ship: `a = [2, 2]`
     - The Kraken attacks the last ship: `a = [2, 1]`
     - No ship sinks.

5. **Input:**
   - `2 15`
   - `1 5`
   - **Output:**
     - `2`
   - **Reasoning:**
     - The Kraken attacks the first ship: `a = [0, 5]` (ship 1 sinks)
     - The Kraken attacks the last ship: `a = [5, 0]` (ship 2 sinks)
     - Both ships sink.

6. **Input:**
   - `2 7`
   - `5 2`
   - **Output:**
     - `2`
   - **Reasoning:**
     - The Kraken attacks the first ship: `a = [4, 2]`
     - The Kraken attacks the last ship: `a = [4, 1]`
     - The Kraken attacks the first ship: `a = [3, 1]`
     - The Kraken attacks the last ship: `a = [3, 0]` (ship 2 sinks)
     - The Kraken attacks the first ship: `a = [2, 0]`
     - The Kraken attacks the first ship: `a = [1, 0]`
     - The Kraken attacks the first ship: `a = [0, 0]` (ship 1 sinks)
     - Both ships sink.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the Kraken's attack pattern and the conditions for sinking ships. It also correctly outputs the number of ships sunk for each test case.
