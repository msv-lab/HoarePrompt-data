Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `k % 2`, which means `t` will be 0 if `k` is even, and 1 if `k` is odd.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `T`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, `mi`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
