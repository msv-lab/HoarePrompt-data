Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is now an integer (converted from the input string), `a` is a list of strings (each element is a string representation of an integer), `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l ≤ n - 1, `r` is an integer such that 0 ≤ r ≤ n - 1, `ans` is an integer that has been incremented by the number of times an element at index `l` or `r` became 0 during the loop execution. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. `n` is now an integer.**
