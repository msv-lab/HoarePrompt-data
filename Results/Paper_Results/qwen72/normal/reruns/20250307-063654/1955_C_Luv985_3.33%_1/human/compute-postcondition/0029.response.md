Output State: **`t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`. Additionally, the current value of `mi - t - k // 2` is 0.**
