Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` and must be greater than `l`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the execution of the code.**

Explanation: The value of `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, which is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the execution of the code. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
