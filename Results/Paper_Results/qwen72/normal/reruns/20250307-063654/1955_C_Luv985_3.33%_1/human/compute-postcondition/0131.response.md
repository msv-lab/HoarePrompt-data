Output State: **`t` is `k % 2`, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` and must be greater than `l`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
