Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an input integer, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l ≤ n - 1, `r` is an integer such that 0 ≤ r ≤ n - 1, and `ans` is an integer that has been incremented by the number of times an element at index `l` or `r` became 0 during the loop execution. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is an integer such that `0 ≤ l ≤ n - 1`, `r` is an integer such that `0 ≤ r ≤ n - 1` and `l` ≤ `r`, `ans` is an integer representing the number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is increased by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `l` is not equal to `r`, `ans` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `l` and `r` are indices, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, and `ans` is an integer. If `l` is equal to `r`, `k` is 0 or less, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `l` is not equal to `r`, the loop continues to execute until either `l` is no longer less than `r` or `k` is no longer greater than 0. During each iteration, the minimum value `mi` between `a[l]` and `a[r]` is determined. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are reduced by `mi`, and `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`. If `a[l]` becomes 0, `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is set to `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. The loop then breaks. After all iterations, `l` will be equal to or greater than `r`, `k` will be 0 or less, and `ans` will be the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` became 0 or when the condition `mi - t - k // 2 == 0` was met.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
