Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - 2 * mi` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`.**
