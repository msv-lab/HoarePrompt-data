Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from the element at index `l` (which is 0) in the list `a`. The value of `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. Therefore, the new value of `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
