Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.
- The values of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are both reduced by `mi`.
- The other variables (`t`, `T`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `mi`) remain unchanged or retain their updated values from the initial state.
