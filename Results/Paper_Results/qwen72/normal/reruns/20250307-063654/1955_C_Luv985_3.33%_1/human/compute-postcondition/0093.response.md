Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - mi * 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, and `a[r + 1]` is 0. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `ans` is 2, and the first element of `a` (`a[l]`) is 0.***
