Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is now an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is now an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[r]` is updated by subtracting `mi` from it.
- The value of `r` is `n - 1`, so `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
