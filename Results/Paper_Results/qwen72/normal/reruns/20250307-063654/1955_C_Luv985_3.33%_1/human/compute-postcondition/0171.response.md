Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`**

Explanation: The code snippet `a[l] -= mi` updates the value of `a[0]` by subtracting `mi` from it. Since `l` is 0, `a[l]` refers to `a[0]`. The value of `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `a[0]` while retaining the initial state of the other variables.
