Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is now `k - 2 * mi`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is now `a[n - 1] - mi`. If `a[0]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `ans` is 1, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) remains 0. If `a[r]` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`) is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, and the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`) is 0.***
