Output State: **`t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is now an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is now an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2 > k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
