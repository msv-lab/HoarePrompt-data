Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 1` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers (each element is the integer representation of the original string), `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` updates the value of `a[r]` by subtracting `mi` from it. Since `r` is `n - 1`, the last element of the list `a` is updated. The value of `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. The initial state is preserved for all other variables, and the updated values of `a[0]` and `a[r]` are reflected in the output state.
