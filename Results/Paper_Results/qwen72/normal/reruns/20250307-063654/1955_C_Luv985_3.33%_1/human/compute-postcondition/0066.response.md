Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0 or a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is an integer such that 0 ≤ l ≤ n - 1, `r` is an integer such that 0 ≤ r ≤ n - 1, `ans` is an integer that has been incremented by the number of times an element at index `l` or `r` became 0 during the loop execution, and `l` is equal to `r`.**
