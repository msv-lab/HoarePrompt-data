Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi`. If `a[0]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `ans` is 1, and `a[0]` remains 0. If `a[n - 1]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, and `a[n - 1]` remains 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
