Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an input string, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

The code snippet `n = int(n)` converts the input string `n` into an integer. The other variables `t`, `T`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is an integer, and the constraints on `t`, `T`, `k`, and `a` still hold.
