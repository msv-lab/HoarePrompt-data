Output State: **`n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `T` is `T - 2` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `mi * 2 > k`**

Explanation:
- `t` is assigned the value of `k % 2`, which means `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `T`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, and `mi` remain unchanged.
- The condition `mi * 2 > k` is still valid.
- The condition `T - 2` is still greater than 0 is still valid.
