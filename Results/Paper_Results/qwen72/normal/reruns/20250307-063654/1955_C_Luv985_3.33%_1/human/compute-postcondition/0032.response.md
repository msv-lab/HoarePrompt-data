Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is now `T - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is now `a[n-1] - mi`, and `ans` is 1 if `a[n-1]` or `a[0]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, `ans` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
