Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t (number of test cases), a list of integers n (where each n_i satisfies 2 ≤ n_i ≤ 2 × 10^5), and two lists of binary strings a1 and a2 (where each string a1_i and a2_i has length n_i and consists of characters '0' or '1'). The sum of all n_i over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided is incorrect for the problem. It should be:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list, a1_list, a2_list):
```

This function will process `t` test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` and two binary strings `a1` and `a2`.
