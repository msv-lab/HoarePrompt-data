Output State: **`i` is 1, `path_ba` is a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 2 elements, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 1 and `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, the tuple `(c1, 1)` is added to `ops`. The values of `i`, `path_ba`, and `c1` remain unchanged.
