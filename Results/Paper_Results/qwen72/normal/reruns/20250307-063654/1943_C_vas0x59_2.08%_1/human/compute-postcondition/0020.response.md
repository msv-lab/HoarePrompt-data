Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, and each connection is bidirectional.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `n` must still be greater than 1, and the variable `_` is just a placeholder used in the loop. The list `u2vs` will contain `n` lists, where each sublist at index `i` (representing node `i`) will contain the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i`. Each connection is bidirectional, meaning if node `u` is connected to node `v`, then node `v` will also be connected to node `u`. The specific values of `u` and `v` will change with each iteration based on the input provided, but the final state of `u2vs` will reflect all the connections that were established during the loop.
