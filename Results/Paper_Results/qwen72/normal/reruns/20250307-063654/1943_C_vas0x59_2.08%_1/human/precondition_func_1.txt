The function `func_2` does not take any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and the subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing edges between vertices `u` and `v` in the tree. The vertices are 0-indexed, and the edges form a valid tree structure.
