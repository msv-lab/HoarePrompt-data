Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the integer value read from the standard input, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n - 1):
    u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    u -= 1
    v -= 1
    u2vs[u].append(v)
    u2vs[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now includes `v` as one of its elements, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes `u` as one of its elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 2, `_` is a placeholder, `u` is the first integer from input minus 1, `v` is the second integer from input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that includes `v` as one of its elements (and `v` is appended to this list again), `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes `u` as one of its elements, and `u` is appended to this list again.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 3, `_` is a placeholder, `u` is the first integer from the new input minus 1, `v` is the second integer from the new input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now includes the current `v` as one of its elements, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes the previous `u` and the current `u` as its elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
