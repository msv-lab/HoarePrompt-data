The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n - 1`. If `n - 1` is at least 1, the loop will execute. This means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder**
