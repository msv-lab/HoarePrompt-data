Output State: **`i` is 2, `ci` is at least 0, `ops` contains a new tuple `(c, 2)` appended to it.** 

The code appends a new tuple `(c, 2)` to the list `ops`, where `c` is the first element of the tuple and `i` is the second element. The value of `i` remains 2, and `ci` is still at least 0. The list `ops` now includes this new tuple in addition to any previous tuples it contained.
