The only objects in the loop head are the placeholder `_` and the variable `n`. The loop can execute again if `n - 1` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, and `_` is a placeholder that doesn't affect the loop condition.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` must be greater than 2, because `n - 1` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
- The placeholder `_` remains a placeholder and doesn't need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `_` is a placeholder, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now includes `v` as one of its elements, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes `u` as one of its elements**
