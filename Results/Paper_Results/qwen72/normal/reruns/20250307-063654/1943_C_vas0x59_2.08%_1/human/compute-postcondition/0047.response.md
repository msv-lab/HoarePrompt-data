To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `ci`. The loop will execute if `ci + 1` is greater than 0. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`ci` must be at least 0**: For the loop to execute at least once, `ci + 1` must be greater than 0. This means `ci` must be at least 0.
2. **`i` is 0**: The loop variable `i` starts at 0.

Given that `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and the length of `path_ba` is an odd number, `ci` will always be a non-negative integer (since the length of `path_ba` is at least 1, and integer division by 2 of any positive odd number is at least 0).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `ci` is at least 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `ci` is at least 0**
