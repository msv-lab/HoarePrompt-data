Output State: **`i` is 3, `path_ba` is a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 5 elements, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, and `(c1, 3)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- `path_ba` is still a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 5 elements.
- `c1` is still `c2 - 1`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
- The list `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, and `(c1, 3)`. The new tuple `(c1, 3)` is appended to `ops` because `i` is 3.
