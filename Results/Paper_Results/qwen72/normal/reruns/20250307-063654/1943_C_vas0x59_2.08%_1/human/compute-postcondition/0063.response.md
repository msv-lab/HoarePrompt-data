The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `path_ba`, and `c1`. We need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time based on these variables.

1. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. Since the loop increments `i` by 2, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 5.
2. **Variable `path_ba`**: The loop condition is `len(path_ba) - c1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(path_ba) - c1`. Given that `i` is now 5, `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 5.
3. **Variable `c1`**: `c1` is defined as `c2 - 1`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`. Since `path_ba` must have at least 5 elements, `c2` is half of the length of `path_ba`. For the loop to execute again, `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 5. Let's break this down:
   - If `path_ba` has at least 5 elements, `c2` is at least 2.5, and `c1` is at least 1.5.
   - For `len(path_ba) - c1` to be greater than 5, `len(path_ba)` must be greater than `5 + c1`.
   - Since `c1` is at least 1.5, `len(path_ba)` must be greater than 6.5. Therefore, `path_ba` must have at least 7 elements.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 5, `path_ba` is a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 7 elements, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`**
