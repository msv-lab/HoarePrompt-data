To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`path_ba`**: This is a list containing the indices of the nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order.
2. **`n`**: This is set to `-1`.
3. **Length of `path_ba`**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
     - `i` is `ci + 1`, where `ci` is at least 0.
     - `ops` contains `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even:
     - The loop has completed all iterations.
     - `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
     - `c1` is `c2 - 1`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
     - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last valid `i`.

Let's analyze both cases:

### Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is odd
- `ci` is at least 0.
- `i` is `ci + 1`.
- `ops` contains `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`.

If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the number of tuples in `ops` is `ci + 1`. Since `ci` is at least 0, the minimum length of `ops` is 1. The exact length depends on the value of `ci`.

### Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is even
- The loop has completed all iterations.
- `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
- `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last valid `i`.

If the length of `path_ba` is even, let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `L`. Then:
- `c2` is `L / 2`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`, which is `(L / 2) - 1`.
- `i` is the last odd number less than `L - c1`, which is `L - ((L / 2) - 1) = (L / 2) + 1`.

The number of tuples in `ops` is determined by the number of odd `i` values from 1 up to the last valid `i`. The number of such odd values is `c2`, which is `L / 2`.

### Conclusion
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the length of `ops` is `ci + 1`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, the length of `ops` is `L / 2`.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is `ci + 1` if the length of `path_ba` is odd, and `L / 2` if the length of `path_ba` is even, with `L` being the length of `path_ba`)**
