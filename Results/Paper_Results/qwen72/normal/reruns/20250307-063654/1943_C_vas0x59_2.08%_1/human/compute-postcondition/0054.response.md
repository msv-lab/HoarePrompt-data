Postcondition: **The loop will continue appending the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `path_ba` until it encounters a value of `-1`. At this point, the loop will terminate. The final `path_ba` will be a list containing the indices of the nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order, representing the shortest path from `b` to `a` as determined by the `bfs` function. The variable `n` will be `-1` at the end of the loop, indicating that the path has reached the starting node `a`. The values of `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even.**
