Output State: **`i` is 5, `path_ba` is a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 7 elements, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 5.
- The list `path_ba` remains a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 7 elements.
- The value of `c1` remains `c2 - 1`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
- The list `ops` now contains the original tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, and `(c1, 5)`, plus the new tuple `(c2, 5)` that was appended.
