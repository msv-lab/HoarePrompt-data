Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now includes `v` as one of its elements, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now includes `u` as one of its elements.**

The code snippet `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Therefore, in the output state, `u2vs[v]` now includes `u` as one of its elements, while the other conditions remain unchanged.
