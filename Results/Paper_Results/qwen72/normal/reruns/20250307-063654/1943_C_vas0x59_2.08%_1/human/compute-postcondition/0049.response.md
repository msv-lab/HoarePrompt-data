The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ci`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `ci + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `ci` is at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `ci` must still be at least 0 to ensure that `i` is less than `ci + 1`.

State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is at least 0, `ops` contains a new tuple `(c, 0)` appended to it.**
