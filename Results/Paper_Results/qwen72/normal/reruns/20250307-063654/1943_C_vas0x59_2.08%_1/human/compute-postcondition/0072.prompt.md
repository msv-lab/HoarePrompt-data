You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and the subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing edges between vertices `u` and `v` in the tree. The vertices are 0-indexed, and the edges form a valid tree structure.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, and each connection is bidirectional.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: The loop will continue appending the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `path_ba` until it encounters a value of `-1`. At this point, the loop will terminate. The final `path_ba` will be a list containing the indices of the nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order, representing the shortest path from `b` to `a` as determined by the `bfs` function. The variable `n` will be `-1` at the end of the loop, indicating that the path has reached the starting node `a`. The values of `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: `i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` is at least 0, `ops` contains `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`, `path_ba` is a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last valid `i`.
    #State: *`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order, and `n` is `-1`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` is at least 0, and `ops` contains `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, the loop has completed all iterations, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last valid `i`. The values of `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is `ci + 1` if the length of `path_ba` is odd, and `L / 2` if the length of `path_ba` is even, with `L` being the length of `path_ba`)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: c1 + 1 1
    #c2 + 1 1
    #c1 + 1 3
    #c2 + 1 3
    #...
    #c1 + 1 i
    #c2 + 1 i (where c1 is c2 - 1, c2 is half the length of path_ba, and i is the last odd number less than len(path_ba) - c1)
    return None
    #The program returns `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, and the subsequent `n - 1` inputs are pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing edges between vertices `u` and `v` in the tree. The vertices are 0-indexed, and the edges form a valid tree structure. The function returns `None`.

Return Postconditions: The program returns `None`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
