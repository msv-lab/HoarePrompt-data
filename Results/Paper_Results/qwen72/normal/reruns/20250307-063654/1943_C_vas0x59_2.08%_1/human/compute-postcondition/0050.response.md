Output State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is at least 0, `ops` contains a new tuple `(c, 1)` appended to it.**

The code snippet `ops.append((c, i))` appends a new tuple `(c, 1)` to the list `ops`. The value of `i` is 1, and the value of `ci` remains at least 0. The list `ops` now includes this new tuple in addition to any previously appended tuples.
