Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will continue appending the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `path_ba` until it encounters a value of `-1`. At this point, the loop will terminate. The final `path_ba` will be a list containing the indices of the nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order, representing the shortest path from `b` to `a` as determined by the `bfs` function. The variable `n` will be `-1` at the end of the loop, indicating that the path has reached the starting node `a`. The values of `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`. `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `path_ba` is a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 2 elements, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3, `path_ba` is a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 5 elements, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 5, `path_ba` is a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 7 elements, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
