Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, and each connection is bidirectional, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from node `a`, `previous` is the array of previous nodes returned by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `b` is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`.
- Since `a` was already assigned the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` will have the same value as `a`.
- All other variables (`n`, `_`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state conditions (`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, `d` and `previous` are arrays returned by the `bfs` function, and `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`) are still valid.
