Postcondition: ***`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order, and `n` is `-1`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` is at least 0, and `ops` contains `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, the loop has completed all iterations, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last valid `i`. The values of `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.***
