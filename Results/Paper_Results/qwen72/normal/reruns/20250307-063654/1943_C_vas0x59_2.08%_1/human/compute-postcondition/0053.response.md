Output State: **`i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` is at least 0, `ops` contains `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value `ci + 1`, which is the point where the loop condition `i < ci + 1` becomes false. The variable `ci` remains unchanged and is at least 0. The list `ops` will contain `ci + 1` tuples, with each tuple being of the form `(c, i)`, where `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 up to `ci`. This list represents the operations performed during the loop, with `c` being the central node in the path from `b` to `a`.
