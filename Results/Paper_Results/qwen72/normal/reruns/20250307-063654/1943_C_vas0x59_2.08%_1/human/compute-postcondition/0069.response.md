To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the structure of the `ops` list:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`path_ba`**: A list containing the indices of the nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order.
2. **`n`**: A constant value of `-1`.
3. **`ops`**: A list of tuples that depends on the length of `path_ba`.

### Conditions for `ops`:
- **If the length of `path_ba` is odd**:
  - `i` is `ci + 1`, where `ci` is at least 0.
  - `ops` contains `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`.
- **If the length of `path_ba` is even**:
  - The loop has completed all iterations.
  - `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
  - `c1` is `c2 - 1`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
  - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last valid `i`.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider an example to understand the output better. Suppose `path_ba` has a length of 6 (even).

- **`c2`**: Half the length of `path_ba` is `6 / 2 = 3`.
- **`c1`**: `c2 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`.
- **`i`**: The last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1` is `len(path_ba) - 2 - 1 = 6 - 2 - 1 = 3`.

So, `ops` will contain the following tuples:
- `(c1, 1) = (2, 1)`
- `(c2, 1) = (3, 1)`
- `(c1, 3) = (2, 3)`
- `(c2, 3) = (3, 3)`

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops` and then prints the results with a newline separator.

The lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` takes each tuple `(c, i)` and formats it as `c + 1` and `i`.

For the example `ops` list:
- `(2, 1)` becomes `3 1`
- `(3, 1)` becomes `4 1`
- `(2, 3)` becomes `3 3`
- `(3, 3)` becomes `4 3`

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output each of these formatted strings on a new line.

Output: **3 1
4 1
3 3
4 3**

### General Case:
If the length of `path_ba` is even and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, then `c1` is `c2 - 1`, and `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`. The `ops` list will contain tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 up to the last valid `i`.

The `print` statement will output each of these tuples formatted as `c + 1` and `i` on a new line.

Output: **c1 + 1 1
c2 + 1 1
c1 + 1 3
c2 + 1 3
...
c1 + 1 i
c2 + 1 i (where c1 is c2 - 1, c2 is half the length of path_ba, and i is the last odd number less than len(path_ba) - c1)**

If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the output will be different, but the format will be the same, with `c` and `i` values as described in the precondition.
