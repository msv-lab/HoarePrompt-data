Output State: **`i` is 1, `path_ba` is a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 2 elements, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- `path_ba` remains a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 2 elements.
- `c1` is still `c2 - 1`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
- The list `ops` now contains the tuple `(c1, 1)` and the newly appended tuple `(c2, 1)`.
