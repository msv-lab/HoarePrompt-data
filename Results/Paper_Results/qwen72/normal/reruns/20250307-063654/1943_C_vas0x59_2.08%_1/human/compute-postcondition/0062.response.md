Output State: **`i` is 3, `path_ba` is a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 5 elements, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`**

The code appends the tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 3, the new tuple is `(c2, 3)`. The list `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`. The values of `i`, `path_ba`, and `c1` remain unchanged.
