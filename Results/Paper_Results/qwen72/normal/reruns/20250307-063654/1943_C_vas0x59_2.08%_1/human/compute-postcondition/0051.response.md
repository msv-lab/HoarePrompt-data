The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ci`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `ci + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `ci` is at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `ci` must still be at least 0 for the condition `i < ci + 1` to hold true.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `ci` must still be at least 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 2, `ci` is at least 0, `ops` contains a new tuple `(c, 1)` appended to it.**
