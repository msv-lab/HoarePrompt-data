Output State: **`i` is 5, `path_ba` is a list of indices of nodes from `b` to `a` in reverse order and must have at least 7 elements, `c1` is `c2 - 1` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, and `(c1, 5)`**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 5, the new tuple appended is `(c1, 5)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated `ops` list now contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, and `(c1, 5)`.
