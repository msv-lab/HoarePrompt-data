Since the `while` loop condition is `True`, the loop will always execute at least once, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, and each connection is bidirectional, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from node `a`, `previous` is the array of previous nodes returned by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`**
