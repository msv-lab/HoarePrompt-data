Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, and each connection is bidirectional, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from node 0.**

The `bfs` function is called with the starting node 0, and it returns a distance array `d` which represents the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph. The second value returned by `bfs` is assigned to `_`, which is a placeholder and not used further. The values of `n` and `u2vs` remain unchanged.
