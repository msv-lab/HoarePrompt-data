Output State: **`n` is the integer value read from the standard input, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.**

The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` from the standard input, and `u2vs` is initialized as a list containing `n` empty lists. Each list within `u2vs` corresponds to a vertex in the tree and will eventually store the vertices connected to it by edges. The initial state information about `n` remains unchanged.
