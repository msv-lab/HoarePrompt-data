The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables `n`, `_`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, and `path_ba` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `_` is a placeholder, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node, and each connection is bidirectional, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function starting from node `a`, `previous` is the array of previous nodes returned by the `bfs` function, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, n]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
