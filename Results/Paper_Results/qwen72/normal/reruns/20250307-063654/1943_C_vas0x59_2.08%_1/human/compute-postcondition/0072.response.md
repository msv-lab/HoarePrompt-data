Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input to construct a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from vertex 0 to find the farthest vertex `a`. Another BFS is performed starting from `a` to find the farthest vertex `b` and the shortest path from `b` to `a`. Depending on the length of this path, the function constructs a list of operations `ops` and prints the number of operations followed by the operations themselves. If the path length is odd, the operations involve a central vertex `c` and its connections. If the path length is even, the operations involve two central vertices `c1` and `c2` and their connections. The function ultimately returns `None`. **
