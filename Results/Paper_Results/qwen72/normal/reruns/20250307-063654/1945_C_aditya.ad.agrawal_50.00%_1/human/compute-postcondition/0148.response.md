Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 3, `ans` is 3, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 3)`, `z_l` is 2 if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 1 if the second element of `arr` is 1, otherwise `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z_r - 1`, `o_r` is calculated based on the values of `z` and `o` and the first two elements of `arr`.**
