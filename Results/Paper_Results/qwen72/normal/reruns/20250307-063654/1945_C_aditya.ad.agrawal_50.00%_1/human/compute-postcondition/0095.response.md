Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr` plus 1, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 3, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` retains its original value, `o_r` is decreased by 1.** 

In natural language: The value of `o_r` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `input_string`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `dist`, `pos`, `i`, `ans`, and `b_d` is still valid.
