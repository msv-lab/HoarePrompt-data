Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least `n` elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o`, `ans` is 0, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 1, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is not met. If the condition is met, `ans` is 1, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 1)`, `z_l` is 1 if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0 if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is `z - 1` if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o` if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is `o - 1`, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 2. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is 2, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 2)`, `z_l` is 1 if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1 if the second element of `arr` is 1, otherwise `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z - 2` if both the first and second elements of `arr` are 0, `z - 1` if only one of the first or second elements of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o - 1` if only the second element of `arr` is 1, `o - 2` if both the first and second elements of `arr` are 1, otherwise `o_r` is `o`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 3, `ans` is 3 if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2 if certain conditions are met, otherwise `ans` is 0, `b_d` remains `abs(n / 2 - 2)` if certain conditions are met, otherwise `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`, `z_l` is 2 if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 1 if the second element of `arr` is 1, otherwise `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z_r - 1`, and `o_r` is calculated based on the values of `z` and `o` and the first two elements of `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
