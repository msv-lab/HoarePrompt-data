Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 integers, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `ans` is 1, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`, `z_r` is `z - 1` if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o` if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is `o - 1`, `z_l` is 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 1, `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.**

Explanation:
- `b_d` is updated to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
