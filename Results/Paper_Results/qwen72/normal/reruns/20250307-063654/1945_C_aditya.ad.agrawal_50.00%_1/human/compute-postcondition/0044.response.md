Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 5 integers, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `pos` is 3, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`. In this case, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `o_l` is increased by 1.**
