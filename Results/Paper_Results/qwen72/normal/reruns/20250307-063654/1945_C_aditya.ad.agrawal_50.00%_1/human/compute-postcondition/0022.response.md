Postcondition: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 integers, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1, and if `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, then `b_d` is equal to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.**
