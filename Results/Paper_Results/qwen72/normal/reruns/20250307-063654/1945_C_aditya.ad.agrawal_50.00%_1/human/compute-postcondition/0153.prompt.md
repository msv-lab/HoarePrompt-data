Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident's preference to live on the left side and '1' indicates a preference to live on the right side. The function should be able to handle up to 2·10^4 test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `t` is within the range 1 to 2·10^4.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string`, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of times 0 appears in the first `n` elements of `arr`, `o_l` is the number of times 1 appears in the first `n` elements of `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` for all positions `pos` where `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `ans` is the position `pos` where `b_d` was last updated.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least `n` elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in the first `n` elements of `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in the first `n` elements of `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met, or 0 if these conditions were never met, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met, or 30001 if the conditions were never met.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least `n` elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in the first half of `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in the first half of `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0s in the second half of `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1s in the second half of `arr`, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is first met, and `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the condition is first met, or 30001 if the condition is never met.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
