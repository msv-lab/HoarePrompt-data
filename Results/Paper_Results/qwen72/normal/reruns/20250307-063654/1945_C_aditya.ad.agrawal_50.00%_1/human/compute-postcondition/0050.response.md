Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string`, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of times 0 appears in the first `n` elements of `arr`, `o_l` is the number of times 1 appears in the first `n` elements of `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` for all positions `pos` where `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `ans` is the position `pos` where `b_d` was last updated.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all `n` iterations.
- `pos` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has processed every element in `arr`.
- `z_l` and `o_l` have been updated to reflect the number of 0s and 1s, respectively, in the entire list `arr`.
- `z_r` and `o_r` are both 0, as all elements have been moved to the left part of the array.
- `b_d` holds the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` for all positions `pos` where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` were satisfied.
- `ans` is the position `pos` where `b_d` was last updated, which is the optimal position that satisfies the conditions. If no such position was found, `ans` remains 0.
