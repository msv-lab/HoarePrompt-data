Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least `n` elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is 30001 if the conditions were never met.**

Explanation:
- `dist` is updated to `abs(n / 2)`, which is the same as the initial value of `dist`.
- `ans` is updated to 0.
- `pos` is updated to 0.
- All other variables (`input_string`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `b_d`) remain unchanged.
