The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user through the `input()` function. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, so the new value of `n` must fall within this range. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string`, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of times 0 appears in the first `n` elements of `arr`, `o_l` is the number of times 1 appears in the first `n` elements of `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` for all positions `pos` where `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `ans` is the position `pos` where `b_d` was last updated.**
