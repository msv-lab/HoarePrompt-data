Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 2, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 2)`, `z_l` is 1 if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1 if the second element of `arr` is 1, otherwise `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z - 2` if both the first and second elements of `arr` are 0, `z - 1` if only one of the first or second elements of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o - 1` if only the second element of `arr` is 1, `o - 2` if both the first and second elements of `arr` are 1, otherwise `o_r` is `o`, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`.**

Explanation:
- `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, which simplifies to `abs(n / 2 - 2)`.
- All other variables (`input_string`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `dist`, `pos`, `ans`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
