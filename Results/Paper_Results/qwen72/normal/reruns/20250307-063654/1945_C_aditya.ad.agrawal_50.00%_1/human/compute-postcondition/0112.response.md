Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least `n` elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o`, `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met, or 0 if these conditions were never met, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met, or 30001 if the conditions were never met.**

Explanation: The code snippet `o_l = 0` resets the value of `o_l` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
