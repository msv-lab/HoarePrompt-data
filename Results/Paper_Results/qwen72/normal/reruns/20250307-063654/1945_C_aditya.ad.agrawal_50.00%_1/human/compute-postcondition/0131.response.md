Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 2, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is not met. If the condition is met, `ans` is 1, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 1)`, `z_l` is 1 if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0 if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is `z - 1` if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o` if the first element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is `o - 1`, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`. `i` is the second element of `arr`.**
