The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `t`. The input is expected to be an integer that represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that the function `func` is expected to handle up to 2·10^4 test cases, so `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident's preference to live on the left side and '1' indicates a preference to live on the right side. The function should be able to handle up to 2·10^4 test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `t` is within the range 1 to 2·10^4.**
