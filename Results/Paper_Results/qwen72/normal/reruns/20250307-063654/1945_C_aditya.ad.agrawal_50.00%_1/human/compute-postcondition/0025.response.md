Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 integers, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1, and `b_d` is either `dist` or 30001 depending on the condition `o_r` >= average of `z_r` and `o_r`. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is `z - 1`, `o_r` is `o`, `z_l` is 1, and `o_l` is 0. If `i` is not 0, then `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o - 1`, `z_l` is 0, and `o_l` is 1.***
