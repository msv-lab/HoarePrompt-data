Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least `n` elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in the first half of `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in the first half of `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0s in the second half of `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1s in the second half of `arr`, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is first met, and `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the condition is first met, or 30001 if the condition is never met.**
