Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least `n` elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in the first half of `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in the first half of `arr`, `z_r` is the number of 0s in the second half of `arr`, `o_r` is the number of 1s in the second half of `arr`, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is first met, and `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the condition is first met, or 30001 if the condition is never met.**

### Explanation:
- **`input_string`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`arr`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`z`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`o`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`dist`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`pos`**: After all iterations, `pos` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `pos` by 1 for each element in `arr`.
- **`z_l`**: This variable counts the number of 0s in the first half of `arr` as the loop progresses.
- **`o_l`**: This variable counts the number of 1s in the first half of `arr` as the loop progresses.
- **`z_r`**: This variable counts the number of 0s in the second half of `arr` as the loop progresses.
- **`o_r`**: This variable counts the number of 1s in the second half of `arr` as the loop progresses.
- **`ans`**: This variable stores the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is first met. If the condition is never met, `ans` remains 0.
- **`b_d`**: This variable stores the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the condition is first met. If the condition is never met, `b_d` is 30001.
