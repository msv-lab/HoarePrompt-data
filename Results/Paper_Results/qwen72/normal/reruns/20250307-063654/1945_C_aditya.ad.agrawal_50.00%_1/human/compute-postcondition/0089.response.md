Postcondition: ***`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 2, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` retains its original value. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and the absolute difference between `b_d` and `abs(n / 2 - 2)` is greater than `abs(n / 2 - 2)`, then `ans` is set to 2 and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - 2)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `b_d` retains its original value.***
