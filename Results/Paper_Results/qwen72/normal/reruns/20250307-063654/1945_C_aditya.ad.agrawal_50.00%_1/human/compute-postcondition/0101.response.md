To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `input_string` is a string input by the user.
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4 - 1.
   - `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5.
   - `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least `n` elements.
   - `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`.
   - `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`.
   - `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`.
   - `pos` is `n`.
   - `z_l` is the number of 0s in the first `n` elements of `arr`.
   - `o_l` is the number of 1s in the first `n` elements of `arr`.
   - `z_r` is 0.
   - `o_r` is 0.
   - `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met, or 0 if these conditions were never met.
   - `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met, or 30001 if the conditions were never met.

2. **Understanding the Conditions:**
   - The conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` are checking if the right part of the array has at least as many 1s as 0s and the left part of the array has at least as many 0s as 1s.
   - The condition `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is checking if the current position `pos` is closer to `n / 2` than the previously recorded best distance `b_d`.

3. **Determining `ans`:**
   - `ans` is set to the position where the above conditions were last met. If the conditions were never met, `ans` is 0.
   - `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met, or 30001 if the conditions were never met.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the value of `ans` depends on whether the conditions were met during the execution of the program. If the conditions were met at some position, `ans` will be that position. If the conditions were never met, `ans` will be 0.

Since the exact values of `input_string`, `n`, and the elements of `arr` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met, or 0 if these conditions were never met)**
