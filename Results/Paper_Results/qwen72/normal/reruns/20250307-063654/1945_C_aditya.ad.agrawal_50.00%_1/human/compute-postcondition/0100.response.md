Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least `n` elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `n`, `z_l` is the number of 0s in the first `n` elements of `arr`, `o_l` is the number of 1s in the first `n` elements of `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met, or 0 if these conditions were never met, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met, or 30001 if the conditions were never met.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `input_string` remains unchanged.
- The `t` value remains within the specified range.
- The `n` value remains within the specified range.
- The `arr` list has been fully iterated over, and it must have at least `n` elements.
- The `z` and `o` values remain the counts of 0s and 1s in `arr`, respectively.
- The `dist` value remains `abs(n / 2)`.
- The `pos` value is now `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The `z_l` value is the total number of 0s in the first `n` elements of `arr`.
- The `o_l` value is the total number of 1s in the first `n` elements of `arr`.
- The `z_r` value is 0, as all 0s have been accounted for in `z_l`.
- The `o_r` value is 0, as all 1s have been accounted for in `o_l`.
- The `ans` value is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met, or 0 if these conditions were never met.
- The `b_d` value is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions were met, or 30001 if the conditions were never met.
