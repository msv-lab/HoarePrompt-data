Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 1, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.**
