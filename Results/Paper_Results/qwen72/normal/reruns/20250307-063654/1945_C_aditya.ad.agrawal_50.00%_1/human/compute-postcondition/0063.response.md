Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string`, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o`, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` for all positions `pos` where `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `dist` is updated to `abs(n / 2)`.
- `ans` is updated to 0.
- `pos` is updated to 0.
- The values of `input_string`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, and `o_r` remain unchanged.
- `b_d` remains the same as it was defined in the initial state, which is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` for all positions `pos` where `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`.
