Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 5 integers, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `pos` is 3, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 3`, `ans` is 0, `z_l` is the number of times 0 appears in the left part of `arr`, `o_l` is the number of times 1 appears in the left part of `arr`, `z_r` is the number of times 0 appears in the right part of `arr`, `o_r` is the number of times 1 appears in the right part of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- `b_d` is assigned the value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.
- Since `pos` is 3, `b_d` is now `abs(n / 2 - 3)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
