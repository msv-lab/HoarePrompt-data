Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 4 integers, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `pos` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, `ans` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.
- Since `pos` is 2, the new value of `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 2)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `dist`, `pos`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
