The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. The state of `i` will be the first element of `arr` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `input_string` is the string input by the user.
- `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5.
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least `n` elements.
- `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`.
- `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`.
- `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`.
- `pos` is 0.
- `z_l` is 0.
- `o_l` is 0.
- `z_r` is `z`.
- `o_r` is `o`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `arr` to have at least one element, and `i` to be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 0 to 2·10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o`, `ans` is 0, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001, `i` is the first element of `arr`**.
