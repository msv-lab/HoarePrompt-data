Postcondition: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 1 element, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `i` is the first element of `arr`. If `i` is 0, then `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z - 1`, `o_r` is `o`, and `b_d` is 30001 if `o_r` is less than the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, otherwise `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`. If `i` is not 0, then `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o - 1`, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001. Additionally, `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`.**
