Output State: **`input_string` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 elements, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 3, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `ans` is 3, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 3)`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. If `i` is 1, `o` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.**
