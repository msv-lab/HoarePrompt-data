Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4; `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; `input_string` is a string input by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string`; `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`; `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`; `z_r` is equal to `z`; `o_r` is equal to `o`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, then `b_d` is equal to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 3 integers, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is either `dist` or 30001 depending on the condition `o_r` >= average of `z_r` and `o_r`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`, then `ans` is 1 and `b_d` is updated to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 4 integers, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `pos` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`. In this case, `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the integer representation of each character in `input_string` and must have at least 5 integers, `z` is the number of times 0 appears in `arr`, `o` is the number of times 1 appears in `arr`, `dist` is the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `pos` is 3, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 3`, `z_l` is the number of times 0 appears in the left part of `arr`, `o_l` is the number of times 1 appears in the left part of `arr`, `z_r` is the number of times 0 appears in the right part of `arr`, `o_r` is the number of times 1 appears in the right part of `arr`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute value of `n / 2 - 3`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
