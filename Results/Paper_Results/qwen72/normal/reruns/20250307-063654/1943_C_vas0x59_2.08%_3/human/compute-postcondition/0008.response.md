The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1. Since the loop has already executed once, `n` must now be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists except `u2vs[u]` which now contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` which now contains `[u]`, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer provided by the user input minus 1**
