The only object in the loop head is the variable `n`. The loop will execute again if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 2. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked, we do not need to adjust it. However, the loop will decrement the effective range by 1 each time it runs, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must now be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists except `u2vs[u+1]` which now contains `[v]`, `u2vs[v]` which now contains `[u+1, u]`, and `u2vs[u]` which now contains `[v]`, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input minus 2, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input minus 2.**
