To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given State:
- `i` is 3
- `len(path_ba)` is greater than 4
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`
- `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`
- `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
2. **Increment**: The loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration.
3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. The next value of `i` will be `i + 2`, which is 5.

### Adjustments:
- **`i`**: After the previous iteration, `i` is 3. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 2, so `i` will be 5.
- **`len(path_ba) - c1`**: This expression determines the upper bound of the loop. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(path_ba) - c1`. Since `i` is now 5, `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 5.

### Derived Conditions:
- **`len(path_ba) - c1 > 5`**: This can be rewritten as `len(path_ba) > 5 + c1`.
- **`c1` and `c2`**: Since `c1` is `c2 - 1` and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, we can express `c1` as `c2 - 1` and `c2` as `len(path_ba) / 2`.

### Final State:
- **`i`**: 5
- **`len(path_ba) - c1`**: Must be greater than 5
- **`c1`**: `c2 - 1`
- **`c2`**: Half the length of `path_ba`

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 5, `len(path_ba)` is greater than 5 + `c1`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`**
