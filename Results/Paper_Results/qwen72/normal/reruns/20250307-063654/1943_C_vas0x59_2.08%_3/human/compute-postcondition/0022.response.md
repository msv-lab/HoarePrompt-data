Output State: **`n` remains the same, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the corresponding node, and the indices are decremented by 1. `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.** 

The initial state is updated to include the new variable `a`, which is assigned the result of the function `func_1` when called with `d` as its argument. The values of `n`, `u2vs`, and `d` remain unchanged.
