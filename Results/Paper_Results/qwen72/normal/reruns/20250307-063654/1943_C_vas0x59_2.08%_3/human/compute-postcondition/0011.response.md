Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists except `u2vs[u+1]` which now contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` which now contains `[u+1]`, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input minus 2, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input minus 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `v` is decremented by 1.
- The initial value of `v` was the second integer provided by the user input minus 1, so after the decrement, `v` is now the second integer provided by the user input minus 2.
- The structure of `u2vs` remains unchanged, with `u2vs[u+1]` containing `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` containing `[u+1]`.
- The value of `u` remains the first integer provided by the user input minus 2.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
