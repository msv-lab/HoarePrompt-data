Postcondition: ***`ops` is a list that contains tuples based on the length of `path_ba`. If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is the node at the index `ci` in `path_ba`. If `len(path_ba)` is even, the loop has completed all iterations, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`, `len(path_ba)` is at least `2 * c2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.***
