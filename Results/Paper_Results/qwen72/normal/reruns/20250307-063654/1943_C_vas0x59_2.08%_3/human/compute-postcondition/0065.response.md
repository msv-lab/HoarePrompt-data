Output State: **`i` is 5, `len(path_ba)` is greater than 5 + `c1`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`**

The value of `i` remains 5. The length of `path_ba` is still greater than 5 + `c1`. `c1` is still `c2 - 1`, and `c2` is still half the length of `path_ba`. The list `ops` now includes an additional tuple `(c2, 5)`.
