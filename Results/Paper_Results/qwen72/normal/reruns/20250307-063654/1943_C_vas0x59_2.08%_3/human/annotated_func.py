#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a non-empty list of integers.
def func_1(l):

    #The program returns the index of the largest integer in the list `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of integers `l` and returns the index of the largest integer in the list. After the function concludes, the list `l` remains unchanged, and the user receives the index of the largest integer in the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters, but it reads from standard input. The input is expected to be a series of test cases, where each test case starts with an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3), followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The vertices are 0-indexed in the internal representation.

    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1

        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` remains the same, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the corresponding node, and the indices are decremented by 1. The variables `u` and `v` are no longer relevant as they are re-assigned in each iteration.

    #State: The loop continues to append the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to the current node in `path_ba` until it reaches node 0 or a node with no previous node (i.e., `n` is -1). The final `path_ba` will contain the full shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order.

        #State: `ops` is a list containing `ci + 1` tuples, each of which is `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`. `path_ba` is a list with an odd length greater than 0, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `c` is the node at the index `ci` in `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci`.

    #State: *`ops` is a list that contains tuples based on the length of `path_ba`. If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is the node at the index `ci` in `path_ba`. If `len(path_ba)` is even, the loop has completed all iterations, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`, `len(path_ba)` is at least `2 * c2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.

    #This is printed: A series of lines where each line contains `c + 1` followed by `i` for each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops`.
    return None
    #The program returns `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case describes a tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, finds the longest path in the tree, and then generates a list of operations (`ops`) based on the length of this path. If the length of the path is odd, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle node of the path and `i` ranges from 0 to the middle index. If the length of the path is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` where `c1` and `c2` are the two middle nodes of the path and `i` ranges over the odd indices from 1 to the last odd index less than the length of the path minus `c1`. The function then prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, formatted as `c + 1` followed by `i` for each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops`. Finally, the function returns `None`.
