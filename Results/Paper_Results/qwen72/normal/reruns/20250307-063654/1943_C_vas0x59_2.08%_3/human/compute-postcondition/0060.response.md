To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head involves the variables `i` and `len(path_ba)`, and the expression `len(path_ba) - c1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `len(path_ba)` is at least 2
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`
- `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`
- `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`

Let's break down the loop head:
```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
```

1. **Initial State of `i`**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by the step value, which is 2. Therefore, `i` will be 3.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1, and `len(path_ba) - c1` was greater than 1 (since the loop executed at least once).

3. **Adjusting `c1` and `c2`**:
   - `c1` and `c2` are not directly modified in the loop head, so they remain the same.
   - `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
   - `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.

4. **Adjusting `len(path_ba)`**:
   - `len(path_ba)` must be at least 2 for the loop to have executed at least once.
   - For the loop to execute again, `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 3 (since `i` is now 3).

5. **Ensuring the Loop Condition**:
   - Given that `c1` is `c2 - 1` and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, we can derive that `c1` is `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`.
   - Therefore, `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 3.
   - Substituting `c1` with `(len(path_ba) / 2) - 1`, we get:
     \[
     \text{len(path_ba)} - \left(\frac{\text{len(path_ba)}}{2} - 1\right) > 3
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     \frac{\text{len(path_ba)}}{2} + 1 > 3
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\text{len(path_ba)}}{2} > 2
     \]
     \[
     \text{len(path_ba)} > 4
     \]

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(path_ba)` must be greater than 4, and `i` will be 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `len(path_ba)` is greater than 4, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`**
