The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads from standard input a series of test cases, where each test case starts with an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3), followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The vertices are 0-indexed in the internal representation. After processing the input, the function returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, each describing a tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges, and returns `None`.**
