Output State: **The function `func_2` reads an integer `n` from standard input, where `n` represents the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3). The vertices are 0-indexed in the internal representation. The input is expected to be followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`.**
