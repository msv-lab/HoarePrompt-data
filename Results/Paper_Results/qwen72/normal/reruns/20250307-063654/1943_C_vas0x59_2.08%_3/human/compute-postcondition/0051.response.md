The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `ci`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `i` is less than `ci + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.

2. **Adjusting the State**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - The value of `ci` remains the same, as it is derived from the length of `path_ba`, which does not change between iterations.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 2) is less than `ci + 1`.
   - Since `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `path_ba` has an odd length greater than 0, `ci` is at least 1 (for a length of 3, `ci` is 1; for a length of 5, `ci` is 2, etc.).
   - Therefore, `ci + 1` is at least 2, which means the loop condition `i < ci + 1` is satisfied when `i` is 2.

State: **`ops` is a list containing two tuples: `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length greater than 0, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `c` is the node at the index `ci` in `path_ba`, `i` is 2**
