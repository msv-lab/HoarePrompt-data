Output State: **`i` is 1, `len(path_ba)` is at least 2, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`**

The code appends the tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 1 and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, the list `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`. The values of `i`, `len(path_ba)`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged.
