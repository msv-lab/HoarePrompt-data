Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists except `u2vs[u+1]` which now contains `[v]`, `u2vs[v]` which now contains `[u+1, u]`, and `u2vs[u]` which now contains `[v, v]`, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input minus 1, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list at index `u` in `u2vs`.
- Initially, `u2vs[u]` contains `[v]`.
- After appending `v` to `u2vs[u]`, the list at index `u` now contains `[v, v]`.
- The values of `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
- The structure of `u2vs` remains the same except for the updated list at index `u`.
