Output State: **The loop continues to append the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to the current node in `path_ba` until it reaches node 0 or a node with no previous node (i.e., `n` is -1). The final `path_ba` will contain the full shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order. `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even. `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`. `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
