To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`: This is the loop variable.
   - `len(path_ba)`: This is the length of the list `path_ba`.
   - `c1`: This is a variable that is derived from `c2`, which in turn is derived from the length of `path_ba`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `ops` is an empty list.
   - The length of `path_ba` is even.
   - `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
   - `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` (exclusive) contains at least one value.
   - This means `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than `1`.

4. **Calculating `c1` and `c2`:**
   - Let `len(path_ba) = L`. Since `L` is even, `c2 = L / 2`.
   - Therefore, `c1 = c2 - 1 = (L / 2) - 1`.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `1 < len(path_ba) - c1`.
   - Substituting `c1` with `(L / 2) - 1`:
     - `1 < L - ((L / 2) - 1)`
     - `1 < L - L/2 + 1`
     - `1 < L/2 + 1`
     - `0 < L/2`
     - `0 < L`

Since `L` is the length of `path_ba` and it is given that `L` is even, `L` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must start at 1.
- `len(path_ba)` must be at least 2.
- `c1` must be `c2 - 1`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `len(path_ba)` is at least 2, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`**
