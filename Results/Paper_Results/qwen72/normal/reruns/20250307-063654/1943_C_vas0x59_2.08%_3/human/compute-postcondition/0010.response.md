Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists except `u2vs[u+1]` which now contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` which now contains `[u+1]`, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input minus 2, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input minus 1.**

Explanation: The value of `u` is decremented by 1, so it is now the first integer provided by the user input minus 2. The value of `v` remains the same, which is the second integer provided by the user input minus 1. The list `u2vs` still contains `n` empty lists except for `u2vs[u+1]` which contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` which contains `[u+1]`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
