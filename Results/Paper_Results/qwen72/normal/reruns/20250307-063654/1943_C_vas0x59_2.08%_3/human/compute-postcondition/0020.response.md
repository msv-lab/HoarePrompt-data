Output State: **After all iterations, `n` remains the same, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the corresponding node, and the indices are decremented by 1. The variables `u` and `v` are no longer relevant as they are re-assigned in each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n - 1` times, so `n` remains unchanged.
- For each iteration, two integers `u` and `v` are read from the user input, decremented by 1, and used to append each other's indices to their respective lists in `u2vs`.
- After all iterations, `u2vs` will contain the adjacency lists for each node, representing the connections between nodes in the graph.
- The variables `u` and `v` are re-assigned in each iteration, so their final values are not meaningful after the loop completes.
