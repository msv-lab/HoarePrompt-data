Postcondition: **`n` is the value of `previous[b]`, and `n` is currently -1. `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the corresponding node, and the indices are decremented by 1. `d` is updated to the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by `bfs(a)`. `previous` is a new list containing the previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)` before the `bfs(a)` call. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)` after the `bfs(a)` call. `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
