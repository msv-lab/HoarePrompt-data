Output State: **`i` is 5, `len(path_ba)` is greater than 5 + `c1`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, and `(c1, 5)`**

The code appends the tuple `(c1, 5)` to the list `ops`. The values of `i`, `len(path_ba)`, `c1`, and `c2` remain unchanged. The list `ops` now includes the additional tuple `(c1, 5)`.
