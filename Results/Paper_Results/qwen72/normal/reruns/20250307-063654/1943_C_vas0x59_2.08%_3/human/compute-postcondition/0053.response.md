Output State: **`ops` is a list containing `ci + 1` tuples, each of which is `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`. `path_ba` is a list with an odd length greater than 0, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `c` is the node at the index `ci` in `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `ops` will contain `ci + 1` tuples. Each tuple in `ops` will have the form `(c, i)`, where `c` is the node at the middle index of `path_ba`, and `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`. The variable `i` will be equal to `ci` after the loop finishes. The list `path_ba` remains unchanged, with an odd length and `ci` still being the integer division of its length by 2.
