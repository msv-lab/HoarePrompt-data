Output State: **`ops` is a list containing two tuples: `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length greater than 0, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `c` is the node at the index `ci` in `path_ba`, `i` is 1**. 

The tuple `(c, 1)` has been appended to the list `ops`, making it contain two tuples now. The other variables remain unchanged.
