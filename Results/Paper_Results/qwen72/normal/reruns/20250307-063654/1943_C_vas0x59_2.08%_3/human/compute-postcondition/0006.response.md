Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists except `u2vs[u]` which now contains `[v]`, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer provided by the user input minus 1.** 

The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` adds the integer `v` to the list at index `u` in `u2vs`. Since `u` is decreased by 1, the list at `u2vs[u]` now contains the single element `v`. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
