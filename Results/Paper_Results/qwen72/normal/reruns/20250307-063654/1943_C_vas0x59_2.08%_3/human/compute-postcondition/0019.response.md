Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists except `u2vs[u+1]` which now contains `[v]`, `u2vs[v]` which now contains `[u+1, u, u]`, and `u2vs[u]` which now contains `[v, v]`, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input minus 1, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `u2vs[v]` is updated by appending `u` to it, so `u2vs[v]` now contains `[u+1, u, u]`.
- The values of `n`, `u2vs[u+1]`, `u2vs[u]`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
