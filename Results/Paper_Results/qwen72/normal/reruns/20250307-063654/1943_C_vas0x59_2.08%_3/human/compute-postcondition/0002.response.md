The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is an input integer with a range of 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, and `_` is not a state that needs to be adjusted as it is just a placeholder variable.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists**
