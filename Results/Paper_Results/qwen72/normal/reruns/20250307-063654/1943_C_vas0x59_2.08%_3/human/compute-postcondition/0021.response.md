Output State: **`n` remains the same, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the corresponding node, and the indices are decremented by 1. The variable `d` is assigned the result of the `bfs(0)` function, which is the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes. The second value returned by `bfs(0)` is not used.**
