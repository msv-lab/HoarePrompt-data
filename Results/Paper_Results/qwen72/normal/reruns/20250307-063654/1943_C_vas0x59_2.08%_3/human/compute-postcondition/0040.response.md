Postcondition: ***`n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the corresponding node, and the indices are decremented by 1, `d` is updated to the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by `bfs(a)`, `previous` is a new list containing the previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)` before the `bfs(a)` call, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)` after the `bfs(a)` call, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, n, n]`. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.***
