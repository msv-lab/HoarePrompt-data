Output State: **The loop continues to append the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to the current node in `path_ba` until it reaches node 0 or a node with no previous node (i.e., `n` is -1). The final `path_ba` will contain the full shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop keeps appending the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to the current node in `path_ba` until it reaches node 0 or a node that has no previous node (i.e., `n` is -1).
- The final `path_ba` will be a list containing the nodes in the shortest path from node `b` to node 0, but in reverse order (starting from `b` and ending at 0).
- The values of `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states, as they are not modified within the loop.
