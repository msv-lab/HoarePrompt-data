The function `func_2` does not take any parameters, but it reads from standard input. The input is expected to be a series of test cases, where each test case starts with an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3), followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The vertices are 0-indexed in the internal representation.
