The code snippet `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list at index `u` in `u2vs`.

- `u` is the first integer provided by the user input minus 2.
- `v` is the second integer provided by the user input minus 2.
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists except for `u2vs[u+1]` which contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` which contains `[u+1]`.

After executing the code, the list at index `u` in `u2vs` will contain `v` in addition to its previous contents.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists except `u2vs[u+1]` which now contains `[v]`, `u2vs[v]` which now contains `[u+1]`, and `u2vs[u]` which now contains `[v]`, `u` is the first integer provided by the user input minus 2, `v` is the second integer provided by the user input minus 2.**
