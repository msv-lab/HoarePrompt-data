You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_2` does not take any parameters, but it reads from standard input. The input is expected to be a series of test cases, where each test case starts with an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3), followed by `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The vertices are 0-indexed in the internal representation.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` remains the same, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the corresponding node, and the indices are decremented by 1. The variables `u` and `v` are no longer relevant as they are re-assigned in each iteration.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: The loop continues to append the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to the current node in `path_ba` until it reaches node 0 or a node with no previous node (i.e., `n` is -1). The final `path_ba` will contain the full shortest path from node `b` to node 0, in reverse order.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: `ops` is a list containing `ci + 1` tuples, each of which is `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`. `path_ba` is a list with an odd length greater than 0, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `c` is the node at the index `ci` in `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci`.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`, `len(path_ba)` is at least `2 * c2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
    #State: *`ops` is a list that contains tuples based on the length of `path_ba`. If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains `ci + 1` tuples, each of the form `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `ci`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is the node at the index `ci` in `path_ba`. If `len(path_ba)` is even, the loop has completed all iterations, `i` is the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`, `len(path_ba)` is at least `2 * c2`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for all odd `i` from 1 to the last odd number less than `len(path_ba) - c1`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is (len(path_ba) // 2) + 1 if len(path_ba) is odd, or len(path_ba) // 2 if len(path_ba) is even)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: A series of lines where each line contains `c + 1` followed by `i` for each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops`.
    return None
    #The program returns `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, each describing a tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges, and returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `None`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
