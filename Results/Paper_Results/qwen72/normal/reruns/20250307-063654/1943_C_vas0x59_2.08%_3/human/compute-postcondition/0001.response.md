Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3), `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list containing `n` empty lists. Each empty list corresponds to a vertex in the tree, and since `n` is the number of vertices, `u2vs` will have `n` elements, all of which are initially empty lists. The value of `n` remains the same as it was read from the input.
