Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[b]`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to the corresponding node, and the indices are decremented by 1, `d` is updated to the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes as computed by `bfs(a)`, `previous` is a new list containing the previous nodes in the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)` before the `bfs(a)` call, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)` after the `bfs(a)` call, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, n]`. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial state information remains valid.
