The function `func_2` reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case describes a tree with `n` vertices and `n - 1` edges. It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, finds the longest path in the tree, and then generates a list of operations (`ops`) based on the length of this path. If the length of the path is odd, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle node of the path and `i` ranges from 0 to the middle index. If the length of the path is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` where `c1` and `c2` are the two middle nodes of the path and `i` ranges over the odd indices from 1 to the last odd index less than the length of the path minus `c1`. The function then prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, formatted as `c + 1` followed by `i` for each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops`. Finally, the function returns `None`.
