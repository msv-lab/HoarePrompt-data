Output State: **`ops` is a list containing three tuples: `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`, `path_ba` is a list with an odd length greater than 0, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `c` is the node at the index `ci` in `path_ba`, `i` is 2.** 

The code appends a new tuple `(c, 2)` to the list `ops`, which initially contained two tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`. The values of `path_ba`, `ci`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `i` retains its value of 2.
