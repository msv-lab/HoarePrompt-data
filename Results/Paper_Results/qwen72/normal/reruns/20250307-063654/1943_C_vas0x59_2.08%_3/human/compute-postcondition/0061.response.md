Output State: **`i` is 3, `len(path_ba)` is greater than 4, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, and `(c1, 3)`**

The code appends the tuple `(c1, 3)` to the list `ops`. The value of `c1` is `c2 - 1`, and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, and `(c1, 3)`.
