Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists except `u2vs[u]` which now contains `[v]` and `u2vs[v]` which now contains `[u]`, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is an integer provided by the user input minus 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in `u2vs`.
- `u` is already decreased by 1 from its initial value.
- `v` is an integer provided by the user input minus 1.
- The list `u2vs` initially contains `n` empty lists, except for `u2vs[u]` which contains `[v]`.
- After the code is executed, `u2vs[v]` now contains `[u]`.
- The values of `n`, `u`, and `v` remain as specified in the initial state.
