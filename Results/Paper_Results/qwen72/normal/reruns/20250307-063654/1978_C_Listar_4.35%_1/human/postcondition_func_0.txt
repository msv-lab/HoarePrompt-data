The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). It returns a list `l` of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, modified based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` remains unchanged and contains integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order. If `k` is not 0, the function repeatedly moves the last element of the list `l` to a new position in the list, either at the front or at a specific index determined by `k`, until `k` is reduced to 0. The final state of the list `l` is a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, with the last element of the list being moved to the front or a specific position in the list `k // 2` times.
