You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_2():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0.
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even.
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: *`n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to `n`.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to `n`. Additionally, `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive) and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). If `n` is odd, `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to \((n^2 - 1) // 2\). If `n` is even, `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive) and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). It returns 0, 0 in Case_1 and Case_2. In Case_3, it returns the values of `n` and `k` if `n` is odd and `k` is less than or equal to \((n^2 - 1) // 2\), or if `n` is even and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0, 0.

Case_2: The program returns 0, 0.

Case_3: The program returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive) and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). If `n` is odd, `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to \((n^2 - 1) // 2\). If `n` is even, `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `n`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
