### Reasoning:

#### Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`
- **Initialization**:
  - `k` is divided by 2, which is a correct step because the Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is always even.
  - A list `l` is created with elements from 1 to `n`.

- **Loop**:
  - The loop iterates from `n-1` to 0 (inclusive).
  - If `k` is 0, the function returns the list `l` as the permutation, which is correct.
  - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element of `l` to the position `-k` and returns the list. This step is intended to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value, but it might not always work correctly.
  - Otherwise, it decrements `k` by `i - 1`, moves the last element of `l` to the front, and continues the loop. This step is also intended to adjust the permutation, but the logic is not clear and might not always produce the correct result.

The main issue with `func_1` is that the logic for adjusting the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value is not robust. The way elements are moved might not always result in the correct Manhattan value, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input**:
  - Reads `n` and `k` from input.

- **Validation**:
  - If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation. This is correct because the Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is always even.
  - If `n` is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` is calculated as `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2`.
  - If `n` is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` is calculated as `n ** 2 // 2`.
  - If `max_k` is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation. This is correct.
  - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

The validation logic in `func_2` is correct and ensures that the program only attempts to generate a permutation if it is possible.

#### Function 3: `func_3(l)`
- **Output**:
  - Prints "YES".
  - Prints the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.

The output format is correct.

#### Function 4: `func_4()`
- **Call `func_2()`**:
  - Calls `func_2()` to get `n` and `k`.
  - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns.
  - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3(l)` to print the permutation.

The orchestration of the functions is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical issue in `func_1` where the permutation generation logic is not robust enough to always produce a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value. The way elements are moved and the conditions for moving them might not always result in the correct permutation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
