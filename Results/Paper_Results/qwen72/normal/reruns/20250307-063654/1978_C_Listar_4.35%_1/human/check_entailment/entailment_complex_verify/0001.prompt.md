You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). It returns a list `l` of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, modified based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` remains unchanged and contains integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order. If `k` is not 0, the function repeatedly moves the last element of the list `l` to a new position in the list, either at the front or at a specific index determined by `k`, until `k` is reduced to 0. The final state of the list `l` is a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, with the last element of the list being moved to the front or a specific position in the list `k // 2` times.

If `n` is odd, `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to \((n^2 - 1) // 2\). If `n` is even, `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. It returns `0, 0` if `k` is odd or if `k` is greater than the maximum allowed value based on `n`. If `k` is even and within the allowed range, it returns the values of `n` and `k`. The maximum allowed value for `k` is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\) if `n` is odd, and `n` if `n` is even.

    #This is printed: (a blank line)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. It prints "YES" followed by the elements of `l` in the order they appear, separated by spaces, and then prints a blank line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `l` remains unchanged.

    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_2`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` as arguments, and then calls `func_3` with the result of `func_1`. The function does not modify any global state or return any values.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze each function and the overall logic step by step.

### Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`
This function is responsible for generating a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `k` is divided by 2.
   - A list `l` is created with elements from 1 to `n`.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to 0 (inclusive).
   - If `k` is 0, the function returns the list `l` as the permutation.
   - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element of `l` to the position `-k` and returns the list.
   - Otherwise, it decrements `k` by `i - 1`, moves the last element of `l` to the front, and continues the loop.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
This function checks if a valid permutation can be generated for the given `n` and `k`.

1. **Input**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.

2. **Validation**:
   - If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation.
   - If `n` is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` is calculated as `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2`.
   - If `n` is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` is calculated as `n ** 2 // 2`.
   - If `max_k` is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

### Function 3: `func_3(l)`
This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.

1. **Output**:
   - Prints "YES".
   - Prints the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.

### Function 4: `func_4()`
This function orchestrates the entire process for each test case.

1. **Call `func_2()`**:
   - Calls `func_2()` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3(l)` to print the permutation.

### Overall Logic:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Validation**:
   - `func_2()` checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range for `n`.

3. **Permutation Generation**:
   - `func_1()` generates the permutation if `k` is valid.

4. **Output**:
   - If a valid permutation is found, it is printed.
   - If no valid permutation is found, "NO" is printed.

### Analysis:
- **Function 1**:
  - The logic of moving elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value is not entirely clear and may not always produce a valid permutation.
  - The division of `k` by 2 and the way elements are moved might not always result in the correct Manhattan value.

- **Function 2**:
  - The validation for `k` being even and within the range is correct.
  - The calculation of `max_k` is correct for both even and odd `n`.

- **Function 3**:
  - The output format is correct.

- **Function 4**:
  - The orchestration of the functions is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical issue in `func_1` where the permutation generation logic is not robust enough to always produce a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
