The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2` and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `n - 3`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now equal to `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, `i` is `n - 3`, `(1 + i)` is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is `n-1`. If `1 + i` > `k`, the program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, and now includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive.**
