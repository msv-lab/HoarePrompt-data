Output State: **The program returns the list `l` which starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive. If `k` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. If `k` is not 0 and `1 + i` > `k`, the list `l` includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`, and the second last element of the list `l` is inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`.**
