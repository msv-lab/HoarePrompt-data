The code `l.insert(0, x)` inserts the value of `x` at the beginning of the list `l`. Given the initial state, `x` is `n`, and `l` is a list of integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive. After the insertion, `l` will now start with `n`, followed by the integers from 1 to `n-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now equal to `k // 2 - n + 2`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, (1 + i) is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is `n`.**
