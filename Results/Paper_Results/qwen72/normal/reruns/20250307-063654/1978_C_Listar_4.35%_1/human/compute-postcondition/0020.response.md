The code snippet `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now equal to `k // 2 - n + 2`
- `l` is a list of integers starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `(1 + i)` is less than or equal to `k`
- `x` is `n-1`
- If `k` is 0, the program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive

Impact of the code:
- The last element of the list `l` is removed. Since `l` initially contains integers from `n` down to `1`, the last element is `1`.

Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now equal to `k // 2 - n + 2`
- `l` is a list of integers starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `(1 + i)` is less than or equal to `k`
- `x` is `n-1`
- If `k` is 0, the program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now equal to `k // 2 - n + 2`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, `i` is `n - 2`, `(1 + i)` is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is `n-1`, if `k` is 0, the program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive.**
