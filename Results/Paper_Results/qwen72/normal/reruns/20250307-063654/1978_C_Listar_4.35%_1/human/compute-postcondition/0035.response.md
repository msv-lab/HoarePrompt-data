Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now equal to `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive. If `k` is 0, the list `l` remains unchanged. If `1 + i` > `k` and `k` is not 0, the list `l` includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`, and the second last element of the list `l` is inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`.***
