Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now equal to `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive. If `k` is 0, the program returns the list `l` as described now. If `1 + i` > `k` and `k` is not 0, the list `l` includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`. `x` is equal to the second last element of the list `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`.
- The initial state of `l` was a list of integers starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive.
- After removing the last element, `l` now contains integers starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive.
- The value of `x` is updated to be the second last element of the list `l` after the removal.
- The conditions for `k` and the potential return of the list `l` remain unchanged, but `l` now has one fewer element.
