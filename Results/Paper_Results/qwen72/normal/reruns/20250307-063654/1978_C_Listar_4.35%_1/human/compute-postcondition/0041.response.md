The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). The function returns a list `l` based on the following conditions:

Case_1: If `k` is 0, the function returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Case_2: If `k` is not 0 and `n` is even, the function returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, with `n` inserted at the position `-k`. After this, `k` is updated to `k // 2`, and `i` is set to `n - 1`.

Case_3: If `k` is not 0 and `n` is odd, the function returns a list `l` starting with the integer `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive.

Case_4: If `k` is not 0, `n` is even, and `n-1` is not already in the list, the function returns a list `l` starting with the integer `n`, followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, and now includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`.

Case_5: If `k` is not 0, `n` is odd, and `n-1` is not already in the list, the function returns a list `l` starting with the integer `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive. If `1 + i` > `k`, the list `l` includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` remains as described initially.

Case_6: If `k` is not 0, `n` is odd, and `n-1` is already in the list, the function returns a list `l` starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive. If `k` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. If `k` is not 0 and `1 + i` > `k`, the list `l` includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`, and the second last element of the list `l` is inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). It returns a list `l` based on the following cases: If `k` is 0, `l` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `k` is not 0 and `n` is even, `l` contains integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive with `n` inserted at the position `-k`. If `k` is not 0 and `n` is odd, `l` starts with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive. If `k` is not 0, `n` is even, and `n-1` is not in the list, `l` starts with `n`, followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, and includes `n-1` at the position `-k`. If `k` is not 0, `n` is odd, and `n-1` is not in the list, `l` starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, with `n-1` inserted at the position `-k` if `1 + i` > `k`. If `k` is not 0, `n` is odd, and `n-1` is already in the list, `l` starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive, with the second last element inserted at the position `-k` if `1 + i` > `k`.**
