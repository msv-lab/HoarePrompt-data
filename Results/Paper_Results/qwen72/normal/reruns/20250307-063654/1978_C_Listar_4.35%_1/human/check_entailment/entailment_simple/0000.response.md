### Reasoning:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k` and performs some checks.
   - It first checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
   - If `k` is even, it calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`. For an odd `n`, `max_k` is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\), and for an even `n`, `max_k` is \(n^2 // 2\).
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists because the required Manhattan value is too large.
   - If `k` is within the valid range, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It starts with a list `l` containing the integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, moving the last element to different positions in the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The loop continues until `k` is reduced to 0, and the function returns the modified list `l`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function prints the result of the permutation.
   - It prints "YES" if a valid permutation is found.
   - It then prints the elements of the list `l` in the order they appear.
   - Finally, it prints a blank line.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function is the main function that processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the values of `n` and `k`.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_4`.
- **Odd `k` Check**: The program correctly identifies that no permutation exists if `k` is odd.
- **Maximum Manhattan Value Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given `n`.
- **Permutation Generation**: The permutation generation logic in `func_1` is designed to achieve the desired Manhattan value by moving the last element to different positions. However, there is a potential issue in the logic where `k` is not correctly reduced in the loop.
- **Output**: The program correctly prints "NO" if no valid permutation exists and prints "YES" followed by the permutation if a valid permutation is found.

### Potential Issues:
- **Reduction of `k` in `func_1`**: The line `k = k - i + 1` in `func_1` might be incorrect. It should be `k = k - i` to correctly reduce `k` by the value of the current iteration.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issue in the reduction of `k` in `func_1`, the program may not always generate the correct permutation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
