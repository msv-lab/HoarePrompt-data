To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Given:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now equal to `k // 2 - n + 2`
- `l` is a list of integers starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `(1 + i)` is less than or equal to `k`
- `x` is `n`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `(1 + i)` is less than or equal to `k`

### Adjusting the State:
- **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. In the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will be `n - 2`.
- **`n`**: `n` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.

### New State:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- The loop will execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `n - 2` must be greater than or equal to 0, or `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `(1 + i)` is now `1 + (n - 2) = n - 1`, and it must still be less than or equal to `k`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now equal to `k // 2 - n + 2`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, `i` is `n - 2`, `(1 + i)` is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is `n`**.
