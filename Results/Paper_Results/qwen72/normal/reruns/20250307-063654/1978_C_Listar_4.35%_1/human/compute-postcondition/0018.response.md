Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now equal to `k // 2 - n + 2`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, `i` is `n - 2`, `(1 + i)` is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is `n`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive.***
