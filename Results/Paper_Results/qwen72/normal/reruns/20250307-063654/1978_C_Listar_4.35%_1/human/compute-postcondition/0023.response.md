Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now equal to `k // 2 - n + 2`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, `i` is `n - 2`, and `(1 + i)` is less than or equal to `k`. If `1 + i` > `k`, the program returns the list `l` which initially starts with the integer `n`, followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, and now includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive.***
