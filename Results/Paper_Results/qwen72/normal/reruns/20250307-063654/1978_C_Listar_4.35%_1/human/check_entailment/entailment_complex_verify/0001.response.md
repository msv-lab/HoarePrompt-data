### Reasoning:

#### Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`
- **Initialization**:
  - `k` is divided by 2. This is done to simplify the problem, as each swap operation can contribute up to 2 to the Manhattan value.
  - A list `l` is created with elements from 1 to `n`.

- **Loop**:
  - The loop iterates from `n-1` to 0 (inclusive).
  - If `k` is 0, the function returns the list `l` as the permutation. This is correct because if `k` is 0, the permutation is already valid.
  - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element of `l` to the position `-k` and returns the list. This is intended to reduce `k` by the smallest possible amount to achieve the desired Manhattan value. However, this logic is flawed because it does not always result in the correct permutation.
  - Otherwise, it decrements `k` by `i - 1`, moves the last element of `l` to the front, and continues the loop. This logic is also flawed because it does not correctly account for the changes in the Manhattan value.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input**:
  - Reads `n` and `k` from input.

- **Validation**:
  - If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation. This is correct because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
  - If `n` is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` is calculated as `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2`. This is correct.
  - If `n` is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` is calculated as `n ** 2 // 2`. This is correct.
  - If `max_k` is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation. This is correct.
  - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`. This is correct.

#### Function 3: `func_3(l)`
- **Output**:
  - Prints "YES".
  - Prints the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
  - This function is correct and follows the required output format.

#### Function 4: `func_4()`
- **Call `func_2()`**:
  - Calls `func_2()` to get `n` and `k`.
  - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns. This is correct.
  - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3(l)` to print the permutation.
  - This function is correct and follows the required logic.

### Overall Analysis:
- **Function 1**:
  - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The way elements are moved to achieve the desired Manhattan value is not robust and does not always produce the correct permutation. For example, the condition `1 + i > k` and the subsequent operations do not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the correct Manhattan value.
  - The division of `k` by 2 and the subsequent operations are not sufficient to ensure the correct permutation is generated.

- **Function 2**:
  - The validation logic is correct and ensures that `k` is even and within the possible range for `n`.

- **Function 3**:
  - The output format is correct and follows the problem requirements.

- **Function 4**:
  - The orchestration of the functions is correct and follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1`. The permutation generation logic does not always produce a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

Final: **False**
