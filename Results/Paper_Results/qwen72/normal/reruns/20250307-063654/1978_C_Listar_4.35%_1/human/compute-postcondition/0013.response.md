The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The program returns 0, 0.
- **Case_2**: The program returns 0, 0.
- **Case_3**: The program returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive) and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). If `n` is odd, `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to \((n^2 - 1) // 2\). If `n` is even, `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `n`.

It returns 0, 0 in Case_1 and Case_2. In Case_3, it returns the values of `n` and `k` if `n` is odd and `k` is less than or equal to \((n^2 - 1) // 2\), or if `n` is even and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.**
