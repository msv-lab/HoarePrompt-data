### Reasoning:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input Validation**: The function correctly checks if `k` is odd and returns `(0, 0)` if it is. This is correct because the Manhattan value of any permutation of length `n` must be even (as each swap changes the Manhattan value by an even amount).
   - **Maximum Manhattan Value Calculation**: The function calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` correctly. For an odd `n`, the maximum value is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\), and for an even `n`, it is \(n^2 // 2\).
   - **Return Values**: The function returns `(0, 0)` if `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, which is correct. However, the original assessment points out that returning `(0, 0)` is not a valid output according to the problem description. The correct output should be "No" if no suitable permutation exists.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initial Setup**: The function initializes a list `l` with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).
   - **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from \(n-1\) down to 0. The goal is to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value `k`.
   - **Conditions**:
     - **`if k == 0`**: If `k` is 0, the function returns the list `l` as it is, which is correct.
     - **`if 1 + i > k`**: This condition is intended to handle cases where the remaining `k` is small enough to be achieved by a single swap. However, the logic here is flawed. The code moves the last element to a position that is not necessarily correct to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
     - **`k = k - i + 1`**: This adjustment to `k` is incorrect. The correct adjustment should be `k -= i` to account for the change in the Manhattan value after each swap.
     - **Swapping Logic**: The swapping logic is also flawed. The code moves the last element to the front, which does not necessarily achieve the desired Manhattan value.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Output**: The function correctly prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l`. This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - **Flow Control**: The function correctly calls `func_2` and `func_1` and handles the output based on the results. However, the original assessment is correct in pointing out that the program should output "No" instead of `(0, 0)` when no suitable permutation exists.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Function 2**: The function correctly identifies invalid cases (odd `k` and `k` greater than the maximum possible Manhattan value). However, it should output "No" instead of `(0, 0)` for these cases.
- **Function 1**: The function does not correctly generate a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. The logic for adjusting the permutation and the value of `k` is flawed.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly in `func_1` where the permutation generation logic is flawed, and in `func_2` where the output for invalid cases is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
