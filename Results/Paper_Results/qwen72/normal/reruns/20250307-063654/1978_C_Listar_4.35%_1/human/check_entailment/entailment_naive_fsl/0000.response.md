Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not always generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. For example, consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 5`. The program should output "No" because it is impossible to find a permutation of length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle this case and may return an invalid permutation or an incorrect Manhattan value. 

Additionally, the function `func_2` incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` for cases where `k` is odd, which is not a valid output according to the problem description. The problem description requires the program to output "No" if no suitable permutation exists, not a tuple of zeros. This is a clear violation of the problem requirements.
