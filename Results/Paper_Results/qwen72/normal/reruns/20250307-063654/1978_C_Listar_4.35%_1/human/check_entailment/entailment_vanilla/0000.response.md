To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze each function and the overall logic step by step.

### Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`
This function is responsible for generating a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `k` is divided by 2.
   - A list `l` is created with elements from 1 to `n`.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to 0 (inclusive).
   - If `k` is 0, the function returns the list `l` as the permutation.
   - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element of `l` to the position `-k` and returns the list.
   - Otherwise, it decrements `k` by `i - 1`, moves the last element of `l` to the front, and continues the loop.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
This function checks if a valid permutation can be generated for the given `n` and `k`.

1. **Input**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.

2. **Validation**:
   - If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation.
   - If `n` is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` is calculated as `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2`.
   - If `n` is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` is calculated as `n ** 2 // 2`.
   - If `max_k` is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no valid permutation.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

### Function 3: `func_3(l)`
This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.

1. **Output**:
   - Prints "YES".
   - Prints the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.

### Function 4: `func_4()`
This function orchestrates the entire process for each test case.

1. **Call `func_2()`**:
   - Calls `func_2()` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3(l)` to print the permutation.

### Overall Logic:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Validation**:
   - `func_2()` checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range for `n`.

3. **Permutation Generation**:
   - `func_1()` generates the permutation if `k` is valid.

4. **Output**:
   - If a valid permutation is found, it is printed.
   - If no valid permutation is found, "NO" is printed.

### Analysis:
- **Function 1**:
  - The logic of moving elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value is not entirely clear and may not always produce a valid permutation.
  - The division of `k` by 2 and the way elements are moved might not always result in the correct Manhattan value.

- **Function 2**:
  - The validation for `k` being even and within the range is correct.
  - The calculation of `max_k` is correct for both even and odd `n`.

- **Function 3**:
  - The output format is correct.

- **Function 4**:
  - The orchestration of the functions is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical issue in `func_1` where the permutation generation logic is not robust enough to always produce a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
