### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Initial State**: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12).
   - **Behavior**:
     - The function divides `k` by 2 and initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
     - It then iterates from `n-1` down to 0.
     - If `k` is 0, it returns the list `l` as is.
     - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element of `l` to a position `-k` from the end and returns the list.
     - Otherwise, it reduces `k` by `i - 1`, moves the last element to the front, and continues the loop.
   - **Final State**: The list `l` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and the function returns this list.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function does not always generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 5`, the function should return "No" because it is impossible to find a permutation of length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5. However, the current implementation may return an invalid permutation or an incorrect Manhattan value.
     - The logic for moving elements in the list is flawed and does not guarantee that the permutation will have the correct Manhattan value.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Initial State**: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It reads `n` and `k` from user input.
     - If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`.
     - If `n` is odd, it calculates `max_k` as \((n^2 - 1) // 2\).
     - If `n` is even, it calculates `max_k` as \(n^2 // 2\).
     - If `max_k` is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.
   - **Final State**: The function returns `(n, k)` if `k` is even and within the allowed range, otherwise it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` for cases where `k` is odd, which is not a valid output according to the problem description. The problem requires the program to output "No" if no suitable permutation exists, not a tuple of zeros.
     - The calculation of `max_k` for even `n` is incorrect. It should be \((n^2 - 1) // 2\) for both odd and even `n`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Initial State**: `l` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of `l` in the order they appear, separated by spaces, and then prints a blank line.
   - **Final State**: The list `l` remains unchanged.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function is correct in its behavior and output.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - **Initial State**: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`.
     - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and exits.
     - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` to get a permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the permutation.
   - **Final State**: The function returns nothing.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function relies on `func_2` and `func_1`, both of which have issues as described above.

### Final Evaluation:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**: The function does not always generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 5`, the function should return "No" because it is impossible to find a permutation of length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5. However, the current implementation may return an invalid permutation or an incorrect Manhattan value.
- **Correctness of `func_2`**: The function incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` for cases where `k` is odd, which is not a valid output according to the problem description. The problem requires the program to output "No" if no suitable permutation exists, not a tuple of zeros. Additionally, the calculation of `max_k` for even `n` is incorrect.
- **Correctness of `func_3`**: The function is correct in its behavior and output.
- **Correctness of `func_4`**: The function is correct in its structure but relies on the incorrect behavior of `func_1` and `func_2`.

Given the issues identified in `func_1` and `func_2`, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly and does not meet the problem requirements.

Final: **False**
