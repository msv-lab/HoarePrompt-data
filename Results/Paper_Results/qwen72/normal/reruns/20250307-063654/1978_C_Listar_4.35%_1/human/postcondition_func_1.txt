The function `func_2` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. It returns `0, 0` if `k` is odd or if `k` is greater than the maximum allowed value based on `n`. If `k` is even and within the allowed range, it returns the values of `n` and `k`. The maximum allowed value for `k` is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\) if `n` is odd, and `n` if `n` is even.
