Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `n` is not equal to 0, `l` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`, and `func_3(l)` has been called.** 

The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were returned by `func_2()`. The value of `l` is still the value returned by `func_1(n, k)`. The function `func_3(l)` has been called, but the specific impact of this function call on the state is not provided, so it is only noted that the function has been called.
