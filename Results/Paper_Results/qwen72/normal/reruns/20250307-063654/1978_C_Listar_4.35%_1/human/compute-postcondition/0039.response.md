Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now equal to `k - i + 1`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n-2`, followed by `n-1`, then `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive. If `k` is 0, the list `l` remains unchanged. If `1 + i` > `k` and `k` is not 0, the list `l` includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`, and the second last element of the list `l` is inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`. `x` is `n-2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is `n-2`.
- The code `l.insert(0, x)` inserts the value of `x` at the beginning of the list `l`.
- The list `l` initially starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive.
- After the insertion, the list `l` starts with `n-2`, followed by `n-1`, `n`, and then the integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive.
- The conditions for `k` and the modifications to `l` based on `k` and `i` remain unchanged.
