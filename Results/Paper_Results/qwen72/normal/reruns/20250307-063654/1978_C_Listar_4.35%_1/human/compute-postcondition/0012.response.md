Output State: **The program returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive) and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). If `n` is odd, `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to \((n^2 - 1) // 2\). If `n` is even, `k` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `n`.**
