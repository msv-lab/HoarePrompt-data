### Reasoning:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function checks if a valid permutation can be generated for the given `n` and `k`.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It first checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
     - It then calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. For even `n`, the maximum value is `n^2 / 2`, and for odd `n`, it is `(n^2 - 1) / 2`.
     - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function returns `(0, 0)` for invalid cases, which is not the correct output format. According to the problem description, the correct output should be "No".
     - This is a clear violation of the problem requirements.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It divides `k` by 2 and initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, attempting to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
     - If `k` is reduced to 0, it returns the current permutation.
     - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element to the position `-k` in the list.
     - Otherwise, it moves the last element to the beginning of the list and adjusts `k` accordingly.
   - **Issues**:
     - The logic for adjusting the permutation to achieve the desired Manhattan value is flawed. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 5`, the function may return an invalid permutation or an incorrect Manhattan value.
     - The function does not correctly handle cases where `k` is not achievable, and it may return a permutation that does not meet the required Manhattan value.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function prints the permutation if a valid one is found.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the permutation.
   - **Issues**:
     - This function is correct as long as it receives a valid permutation from `func_1`.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - **Purpose**: This function orchestrates the entire process by calling `func_2` to check for valid inputs and `func_1` to generate the permutation, then printing the result.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`.
     - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and exits.
     - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` to get the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print it.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function relies on `func_2` and `func_1` to handle the logic correctly. Since `func_2` and `func_1` have issues, `func_4` will also have issues.

### Final Evaluation:

- **Original Assessment**: The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and it violates the problem requirements by returning `(0, 0)` instead of "No" for invalid cases.
- **Function 2**: Incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` for invalid cases.
- **Function 1**: Flawed logic for generating the permutation, leading to incorrect or invalid permutations in some cases.

### Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues in `func_2` and `func_1`.
