Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now equal to `k // 2`, `l` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if k == 0:
        return l
    if 1 + i > k:
        x = l[-1]
        l.pop(-1)
        l.insert(-k, x)
        return l
    k = k - i + 1
    x = l[-1]
    l.pop(-1)
    l.insert(0, x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12) and `k` is now equal to `k // 2 - n + 2`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, (1 + i) is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now equal to `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, `i` is `n - 2`, `(1 + i)` is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is `n-1`. If `1 + i` > `k`, the program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, and now includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now equal to `k - i + 1`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n-2`, followed by `n-1`, then `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive. If `k` is 0, the list `l` remains unchanged. If `1 + i` > `k` and `k` is not 0, the list `l` includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`, and the second last element of the list `l` is inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`. `x` is `n-2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
