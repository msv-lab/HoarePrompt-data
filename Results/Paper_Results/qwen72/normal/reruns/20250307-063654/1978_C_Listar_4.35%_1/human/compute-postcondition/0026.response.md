Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now equal to `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, `i` is `n - 2`, `(1 + i)` is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is `n-1`. If `1 + i` > `k`, the program returns the list `l` which initially starts with the integer `n`, followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, and now includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`. If `k` is 0, the program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive.**
