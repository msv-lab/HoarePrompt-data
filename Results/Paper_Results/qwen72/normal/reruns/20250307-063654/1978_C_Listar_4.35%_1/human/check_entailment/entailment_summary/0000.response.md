### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k` and performs some initial checks.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is calculated as \((n^2 - 1) // 2\) if `n` is odd, and \(n^2 // 2\) if `n` is even.
   - If `k` is even and within the allowed range, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value equal to `k`.
   - It starts with a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.
   - It then modifies the list by moving the last element to a new position in the list, either at the front or at a specific index determined by `k`, until `k` is reduced to 0.
   - The number of moves is `k // 2`, which ensures that the total Manhattan value is `k`.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function prints the result of the permutation.
   - It prints "YES" if a valid permutation is found, followed by the elements of the permutation list `l`.
   - It is used to format and display the output as required.

4. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function is the main function that ties everything together.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the values of `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and exits, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling:** `func_2` correctly reads the input and checks if `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value. This ensures that invalid inputs are handled appropriately.
- **Permutation Generation:** `func_1` generates a permutation by moving elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. The logic of moving the last element to a new position `k // 2` times is correct and ensures the Manhattan value is `k`.
- **Output Formatting:** `func_3` correctly formats and prints the output as required.
- **Main Function:** `func_4` orchestrates the process by calling the other functions in the correct order and handling the cases where no valid permutation exists.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem as described. It checks for invalid inputs, generates the required permutation, and formats the output correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
