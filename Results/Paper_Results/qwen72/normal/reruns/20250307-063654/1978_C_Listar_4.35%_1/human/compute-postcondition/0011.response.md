Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. It prints "YES" followed by the elements of `l` in the order they appear, separated by spaces, and then prints a blank line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `l` remains unchanged. **
