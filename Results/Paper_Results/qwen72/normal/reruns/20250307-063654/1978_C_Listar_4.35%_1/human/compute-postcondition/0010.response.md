The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `l`. `l` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. The function does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list `l` of integers that represents a permutation of length `n`, and it does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and it does not return any value.**
