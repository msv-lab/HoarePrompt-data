Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is now equal to `k - i + 1`, `l` is a list of integers starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive. If `k` is 0, the list `l` remains unchanged. If `1 + i` > `k` and `k` is not 0, the list `l` includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`, and the second last element of the list `l` is inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`. `x` is `n-2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element of the list `l`.
- The initial list `l` contains integers starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive.
- After executing `l.pop(-1)`, the last element, which is `n-2`, is removed.
- The new list `l` now contains integers starting with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive.
- The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `k` and the modifications to `l` based on `k` and `i` are still valid, but the list `l` has been updated by removing the last element.
