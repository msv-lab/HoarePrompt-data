You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12).
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        x = l[-1]
        
        l.pop(-1)
        
        l.insert(0, x)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the list `l` is now a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, with the last element of the list `l` being moved to the front of the list `k // 2` times, and `k` is now 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). It returns a list `l` based on the following cases: If `k` is 0, `l` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `k` is not 0 and `n` is even, `l` contains integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive with `n` inserted at the position `-k`. If `k` is not 0 and `n` is odd, `l` starts with `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive. If `k` is not 0, `n` is even, and `n-1` is not in the list, `l` starts with `n`, followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, and includes `n-1` at the position `-k`. If `k` is not 0, `n` is odd, and `n-1` is not in the list, `l` starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, with `n-1` inserted at the position `-k` if `1 + i` > `k`. If `k` is not 0, `n` is odd, and `n-1` is already in the list, `l` starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive, with the second last element inserted at the position `-k` if `1 + i` > `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).

Case_2: The program returns the list `l` which contains integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive, with `n` inserted at the position `-k`. `k` is now equal to `k // 2`, and `i` is `n - 1`.

Case_3: The program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n` followed by integers from 1 to `n-1` inclusive.

Case_4: The program returns the list `l` which initially starts with the integer `n`, followed by integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive, and now includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`.

Case_5: The program returns the list `l` which starts with the integer `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-2` inclusive. If `1 + i` > `k`, the list `l` includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`. If `k` is 0, the list `l` remains as described initially.

Case_6: The program returns the list `l` which starts with `n-1`, followed by `n`, and then integers from 1 to `n-3` inclusive. If `k` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. If `k` is not 0 and `1 + i` > `k`, the list `l` includes the integer `n-1` at the position `-k`, and the second last element of the list `l` is inserted at the position `-k` in the list `l`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
