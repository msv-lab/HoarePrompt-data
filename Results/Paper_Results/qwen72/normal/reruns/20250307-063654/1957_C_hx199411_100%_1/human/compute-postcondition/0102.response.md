The provided code snippet updates the values of `c` and `r` by taking input from the user and splitting it into two integers. The initial state specifies that `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, but now they are updated with new input values. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `t`, `num`, `m`, and `dp`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `c` and `r` are the new input integers, `t` is `False`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with specific initial values and the rest calculated using the given formula.**
