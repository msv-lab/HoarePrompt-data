The value of `num` is incremented by 2. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are updated with input values, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `c` and `r` are the new input integers, `t` is `False`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with specific initial values and the rest calculated using the given formula. Since `num` is the only variable affected by the code, the output state will reflect this change while keeping the rest of the variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `c` and `r` are the new input integers, `t` is `False`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with specific initial values and the rest calculated using the given formula, `num` is increased by 2.**
