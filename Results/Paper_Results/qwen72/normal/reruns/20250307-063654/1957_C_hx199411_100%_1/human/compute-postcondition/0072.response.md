Output State: **`i` is `k` - 1, `k` is the initial value of `k`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `n - num`, `num` is increased by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is increased by 2, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0.
- The length of `dp` is `m + 1`, where `m` is `n - num`.
- The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `n`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition that `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1 still holds.
