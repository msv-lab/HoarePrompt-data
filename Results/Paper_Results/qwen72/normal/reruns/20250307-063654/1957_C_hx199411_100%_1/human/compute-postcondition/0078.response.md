Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is 4, `m` must be at least 4, `n` is unchanged, `num` is such that `n - num` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 4.
- The value of `dp[4]` is calculated as `(dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Substituting the known values: `(8 + 3 * 3 * 2) % 1000000007`.
- This simplifies to `(8 + 18) % 1000000007`, which is `26 % 1000000007`, resulting in `26`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
