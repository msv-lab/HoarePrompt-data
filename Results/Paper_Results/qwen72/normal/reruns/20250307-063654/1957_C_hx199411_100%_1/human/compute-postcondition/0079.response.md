The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `m`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `m` must be at least 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5. The condition for the loop to continue is that `m` must be at least 4, but since `i` is now 5, `m` must be at least 5 to satisfy the loop condition `i < m + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 5, `k` is 4, `m` must be at least 5, `n` is unchanged, `num` is such that `n - num` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26**
