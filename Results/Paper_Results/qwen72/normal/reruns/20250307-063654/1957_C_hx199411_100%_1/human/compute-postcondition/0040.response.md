To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the structure of the `dp` list:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `m`.
   - `m` is at least 3.
   - `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros.
   - `dp[1]` is 1.
   - `dp[2]` is 3.
   - `dp[3]` is 8.
   - `dp[4]` is 19.
   - `dp[5]` is 37.
   - And so on up to `dp[m]` with the final value calculated by the loop.

2. **Understanding the `dp` List**:
   - The list `dp` is initialized with `m + 1` zeros.
   - The values at indices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are explicitly given as 1, 3, 8, 19, and 37, respectively.
   - The values from `dp[6]` to `dp[m]` are calculated by a loop, but the exact formula for the loop is not provided in the initial state.

3. **Final Value Calculation**:
   - Since the exact formula for the loop is not provided, we can only describe the final value of `dp[m]` based on the given initial values and the structure of the problem.

Given the initial values and the structure, the `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value at index `m` of the list `dp`. The value at `dp[m]` is the result of the loop that calculates the values from `dp[6]` to `dp[m]`, but without the loop formula, we can only describe it in terms of the provided values and the loop's effect.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value at index m of the list dp, calculated by the loop starting from the given initial values [1, 3, 8, 19, 37, ...])**
