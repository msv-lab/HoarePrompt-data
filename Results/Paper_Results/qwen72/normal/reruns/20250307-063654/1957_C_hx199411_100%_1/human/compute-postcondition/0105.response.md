Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `c` and `r` are the new input integers, `t` is `False`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with specific initial values and the rest calculated using the given formula. If `c == r`, `num` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is increased by 2.***
