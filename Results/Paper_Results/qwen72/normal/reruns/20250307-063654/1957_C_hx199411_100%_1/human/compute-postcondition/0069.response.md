Postcondition: **`i` is `k` - 1, `k` is the initial value of `k`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `n - num`, and `num` is increased by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is increased by 2. Additionally, `m` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `m` is 1.**
