The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, which means `t` is already non-zero and within the specified range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, and each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid.**
