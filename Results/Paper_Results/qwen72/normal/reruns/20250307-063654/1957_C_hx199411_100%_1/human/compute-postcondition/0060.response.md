The code snippet `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes user input, splits it by spaces, converts the resulting strings to integers, and assigns these integers to `c` and `r`. The initial values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition for `num` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, and `num` is not yet updated.**
