The value of `num` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `num` is unknown. The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged. Since `c` is equal to `r`, this equality still holds true.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input and `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is increased by 1.**
