Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `num` is the total number of times the loop has incremented `num` based on the conditions `c == r` (increment by 1) or `c != r` (increment by 2), `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, `t` is `False`, and `m` is not equal to 0, and `m` is not equal to 1.**
