Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 0 <= k <= n, each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` == `r` and 2 for each move where `c` != `r`, `i` is `k` - 1, `c` is the last input integer from the `k` moves, `r` is the last input integer from the `k` moves, `m` is `n` - `num`, and `m` is not equal to 0.**
