Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
   - `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `k` is an input integer where \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
   - Each move \((r_i, c_i)\) is a pair of integers where \(1 \leq r_i, c_i \leq n\), and all moves are valid.
   - `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` == `r` and 2 for each move where `c` != `r`.
   - `i` is \(k - 1\).
   - `c` is the last input integer from the `k` moves.
   - `r` is the last input integer from the `k` moves.
   - `m` is \(n - \text{num}\).
   - `m` is 1.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `m` is given as 1. This means \(n - \text{num} = 1\).
   - Therefore, \(\text{num} = n - 1\).

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

4. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer 1.
   - The value of `m` being 1 does not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement is not dependent on `m` or any other variable.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The code will print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
