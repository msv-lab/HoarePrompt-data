The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is increased by 1. If `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` is increased by 2.**
