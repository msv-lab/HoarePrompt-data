The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 1, and `k` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 1, each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid, `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, `i` is 1, `c` is an input integer, and `r` is an input integer.**
