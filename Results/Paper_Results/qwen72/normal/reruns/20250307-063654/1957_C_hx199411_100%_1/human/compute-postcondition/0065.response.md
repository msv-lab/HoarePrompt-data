The value of `m` is assigned the result of `n - num`. The value of `num` depends on the condition where if `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is increased by 1, otherwise, `num` is increased by 2. The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `k` - 1, `k` is the initial value of `k`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `n - num`, and `num` is increased by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is increased by 2.**
