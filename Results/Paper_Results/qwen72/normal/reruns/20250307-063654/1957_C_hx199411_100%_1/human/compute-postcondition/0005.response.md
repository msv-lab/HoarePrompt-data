The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the first value in the range of `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1
- `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5
- `k` is an input integer where 0 <= k <= n
- Each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid
- `num` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid, `num` is 0, `i` is 0**
