Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 19, `dp[5]` is 37, and so on up to `dp[m]` with the final value calculated by the loop.**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` initialized to 3 and iterates up to `m`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `m`.
- The value of `m` remains at least 3, as it was specified in the initial conditions.
- The `dp` list is updated during each iteration of the loop. The values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` remain unchanged (1 and 3, respectively).
- The values of `dp[3]`, `dp[4]`, `dp[5]`, and so on, up to `dp[m]` are calculated by the loop using the formula:
  - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- The final value of `dp[m]` is the result of the last iteration of the loop, where `i` is `m`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
