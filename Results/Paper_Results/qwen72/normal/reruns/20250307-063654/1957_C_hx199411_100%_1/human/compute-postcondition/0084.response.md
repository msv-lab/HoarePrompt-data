Postcondition: ***`i` is `k` - 1, `k` is the initial value of `k`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `n - num`, and `num` is increased by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is increased by 2. If `m` is 0, `m` remains 0. If `m` is 1, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is the initial value of `k`, and `m` remains 1. If `m` is at least 5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, and `dp` is populated as follows: `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 50, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`.***
