Output State: **`i` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8**

Explanation:
- `i` is 3.
- `m` is at least 3.
- `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros.
- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `dp[2]` is 3.
- The code snippet updates `dp[3]` as follows:
  - `dp[i - 1]` is `dp[2]`, which is 3.
  - `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` is `(3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2`, which is `2 * 1 * 2 = 4`.
  - Therefore, `dp[3]` is `(3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is `7 % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7`.
  - However, the correct calculation for `dp[3]` should be `(3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which is `7 % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7`.
  - The correct value for `dp[3]` is actually `7 % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7`, but since the modulo operation with a large number like `10 ** 9 + 7` does not change the value, `dp[3]` is 7.

Thus, the updated value of `dp[3]` is 8. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
