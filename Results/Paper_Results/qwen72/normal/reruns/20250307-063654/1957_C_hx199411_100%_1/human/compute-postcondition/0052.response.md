The value of `num` is incremented by 2. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, and `r`) are not affected by this code snippet. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input with `c` not equal to `r`, these conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, and `c` is not equal to `r`; `num` is increased by 2.**
