Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 50, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`, `t` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if c == r:
        num += 1
    else:
        num += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `num` is 0 if `c` is not equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 1. `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 50, `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`, `t` is `False`, and `c` and `r` are updated with the last input integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `t` is `False`, and `c` and `r` are updated with the last input integers. If `c` == `r`, `num` is 2, and `m` is `n - 2`. If `c` != `r`, `num` is 3, and `m` is `n - 3`. In both cases, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, and `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 50, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `c` and `r` are the new input integers, `t` is `False`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with specific initial values and the rest calculated using the given formula. If `c == r`, `num` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is increased by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
