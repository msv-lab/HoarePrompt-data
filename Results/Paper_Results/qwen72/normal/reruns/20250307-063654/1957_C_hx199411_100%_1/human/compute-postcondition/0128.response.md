The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the size of the board), `k` (the number of moves), and a list of moves represented as pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)`.

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, representing the size of the board and the number of moves, respectively.
- Each move `(r_i, c_i)` is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case. However, the specific output is not described in the provided information. Given the context, it is likely that the function returns some form of evaluation or result based on the moves made on the board.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the size of a board `n`, the number of moves `k`, and a list of valid moves `(r_i, c_i)`. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the moves made on the board.**
