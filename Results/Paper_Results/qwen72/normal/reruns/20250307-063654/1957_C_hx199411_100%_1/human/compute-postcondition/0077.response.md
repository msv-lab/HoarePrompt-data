The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `k` is 4, `m` must be at least 3, `n` is unchanged, `num` is such that `n - num` is at least 3, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with specific values.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `m` must still be at least 3. Since `i` is 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 4 at the start of the next iteration. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` (which is now 4) must be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 4, `k` is 4, `m` must be at least 4, `n` is unchanged, `num` is such that `n - num` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8.**
