Output State: **`i` is `m`, `k` is 4, `m` must be at least 5, `n` is unchanged, `num` is such that `n - num` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 50, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7).`**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `m` because the loop iterates from 3 to `m` inclusive.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` remains unchanged at 4.
- **`m`**: `m` must be at least 5 to ensure the loop executes at least 3 times, and it remains unchanged.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- **`num`**: The value of `num` is such that `n - num` is at least 3, and it remains unchanged.
- **`dp`**: The list `dp` is updated for each index from 3 to `m`. The initial values for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are 1 and 3, respectively. The values for `dp[3]`, `dp[4]`, and `dp[5]` are given as 8, 26, and 50, respectively. For `i` from 6 to `m`, the values are calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
