Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4 - 2, `n` is the first input integer from the split input, `k` is the second input integer from the split input, `i` is `k` - 1, `c` is the last input integer from the `k` moves, `r` is the last input integer from the `k` moves, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` == `r` and 2 for each move where `c` != `r`, `m` is `n` - `num`. If `m` is 0 or 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is updated to `m`, and `dp` is a list of `m + 1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 19, `dp[5]` is 37, and so on up to `dp[m]` with the final value calculated by the loop.**
