Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `k - 1`, where `k` is the initial value of `k`.
   - `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `m` is `n - num`.
   - `num` is increased by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is increased by 2.
   - `m` is not equal to 0.
   - The current value of `m` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code snippet `print(1)` simply prints the integer value 1.
   - The value of `m` is given as 1, and the code snippet does not use any of the other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `n`, `num`).

Since the code snippet only prints the integer 1 and does not depend on any other variables or conditions, the output is straightforward.

Output: **1**
