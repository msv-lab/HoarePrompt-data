Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `k` is the initial value of `k`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `n - num`, `num` is increased by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is increased by 2, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 50, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`, `t` is `True - 1` (which is `False`)**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decreased by 1, which changes `t` from `True` to `False`.
- All other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `num`, and `dp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
