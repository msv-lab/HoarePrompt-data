Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `num` is the total number of times the loop has incremented `num` based on the conditions `c == r` (increment by 1) or `c != r` (increment by 2), `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` which are updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `t` is `False`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `num`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The variable `m` is still `n - num` and must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.
- The list `dp` is updated such that each element `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final state of `dp` reflects the result of these calculations.
