The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at some value within the range of 3 to `m`, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `i` for the loop to have executed up to that point.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than or equal to this new value of `i`.

State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10`, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**
