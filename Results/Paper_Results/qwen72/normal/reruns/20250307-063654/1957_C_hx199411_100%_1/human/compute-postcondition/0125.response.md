Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `num` is the total number of times the loop has incremented `num` based on the conditions `c == r` (increment by 1) or `c != r` (increment by 2), `m` is `n - num`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0. If `m` is 1, `t` remains `False`. If `m` is at least 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`.***
