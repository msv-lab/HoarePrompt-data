Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 1, each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid, `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, `i` is 1, `c` is the first integer from the input, and `r` is the second integer from the input.**
