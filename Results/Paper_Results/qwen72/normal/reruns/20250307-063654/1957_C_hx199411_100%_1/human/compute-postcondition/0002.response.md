Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, and each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new range for `t` is 0 to 10^4 - 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
