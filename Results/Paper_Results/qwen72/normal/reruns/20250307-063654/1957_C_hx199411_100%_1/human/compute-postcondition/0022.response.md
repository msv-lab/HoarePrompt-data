Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 0 <= k <= n, each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` == `r` and 2 for each move where `c` != `r`, `i` is `k` - 1, `c` is the last input integer from the `k` moves, and `r` is the last input integer from the `k` moves.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` is the total number of iterations the loop will execute.
- The variable `num` will be the sum of 1 for each move where `c` is equal to `r`, and 2 for each move where `c` is not equal to `r`.
- The variable `i` will be `k - 1` after the loop has finished executing, indicating that the loop has completed all `k` iterations.
- The variables `c` and `r` will hold the values of the last move (r_k, c_k) that was processed in the loop.
