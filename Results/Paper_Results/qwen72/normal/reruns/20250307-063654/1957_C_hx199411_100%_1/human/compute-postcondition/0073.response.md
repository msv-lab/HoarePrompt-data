Output State: **`i` is `k` - 1, `k` is the initial value of `k`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `n - num`, `num` is increased by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is increased by 2, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, and `dp[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `dp[1] = 1` updates the second element (index 1) of the list `dp` to 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged. The list `dp` now has its first element (index 0) still set to 0, and the second element (index 1) set to 1. The length of `dp` is still `m + 1`, and all other elements in the list remain 0.
