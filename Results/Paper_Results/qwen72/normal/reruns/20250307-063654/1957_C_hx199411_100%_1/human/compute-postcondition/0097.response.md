Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `k`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `num` is 0 if `c` is not equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 1, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 50, `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`, `t` is `False`, and `c` and `r` are updated with the last input integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, including the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `num`, `m`, `dp`, and `t`. The new values of `c` and `r` are the last input integers.
