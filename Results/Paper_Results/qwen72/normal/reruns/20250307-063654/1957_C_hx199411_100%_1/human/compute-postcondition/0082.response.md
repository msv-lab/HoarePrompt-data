To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to calculate the elements of the `dp` list.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `m`.
- `k` is 4.
- `m` must be at least 5.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `num` is such that `n - num` is at least 3.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
- `dp[1]` is 1.
- `dp[2]` is 3.
- `dp[3]` is 8.
- `dp[4]` is 26.
- `dp[5]` is 50.
- `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initialization of `dp`**:
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - The first 5 elements of `dp` are explicitly given:
     - `dp[1] = 1`
     - `dp[2] = 3`
     - `dp[3] = 8`
     - `dp[4] = 26`
     - `dp[5] = 50`

2. **Calculation of `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m`**:
   - The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)` is used to calculate the values of `dp` for indices from 6 to `m`.

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Let's assume `m = 6` (since `m` must be at least 5).
   - Calculate `dp[6]`:
     - `dp[6] = (dp[5] + (6 - 1) * dp[4] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`
     - `dp[6] = (50 + 5 * 26 * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`
     - `dp[6] = (50 + 260) % (10**9 + 7)`
     - `dp[6] = 310 % (10**9 + 7)`
     - `dp[6] = 310`

4. **General Case**:
   - For any `m` greater than 5, the value of `dp[m]` will be calculated similarly using the given formula.
   - The formula ensures that the value of `dp[m]` is always within the range of `0` to `10**9 + 6` due to the modulo operation.

### Final Output:
The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)` for `i` from 6 to `m`.

Since the exact value of `m` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `dp[m]`.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value of dp[m] calculated using the formula dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7) for i from 6 to m)**
