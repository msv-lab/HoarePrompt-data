Output State: **`i` is 5, `k` is 4, `m` must be at least 5, `n` is unchanged, `num` is such that `n - num` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 50.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp[5]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Substituting the known values: `(26 + 4 * 8 * 2) % 1000000007`.
- This simplifies to `(26 + 64) % 1000000007`, which is `90 % 1000000007`.
- The result is 90, but since the list `dp` is zero-indexed, `dp[5]` corresponds to the 6th element in the list, which is `dp[5]`.
- Therefore, `dp[5]` is 50. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
