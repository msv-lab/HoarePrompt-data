Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid, `num` is 1 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` is an input integer, and `r` is an input integer.***
