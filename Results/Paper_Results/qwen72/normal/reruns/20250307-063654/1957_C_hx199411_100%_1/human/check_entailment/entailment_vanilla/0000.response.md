### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - You place a white rook, and the computer places a black rook in the mirrored position.
   - If the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations after all possible moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the board and the number of initial moves.
   - It then reads \( k \) moves and calculates the number of rooks already placed (including the computer's mirrored moves).

3. **Counting Rooks:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of rooks already placed.
   - For each move \( (c, r) \):
     - If \( c = r \), it counts as one rook.
     - If \( c \neq r \), it counts as two rooks (one white and one black).

4. **Remaining Positions:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as \( n - num \), which represents the number of positions left for placing rooks.
   - If \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \), the number of configurations is 1 because no more moves can be made.

5. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - For \( m \geq 2 \), the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations.
   - The array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This relation accounts for:
     - Placing a rook in the current position and continuing with the remaining positions (`dp[i - 1]`).
     - Placing a rook in the current position and then placing a rook in a mirrored position, which leaves \( i - 2 \) positions (`(i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2`).

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of configurations for each test case, which is `dp[m]`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and counts the number of rooks already placed.
- The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the number of configurations.
- The recurrence relation is correctly implemented and accounts for both placing a rook and the mirrored placement.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.
