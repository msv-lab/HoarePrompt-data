The loop head in this case is `while t:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to proceed, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is non-zero. However, the problem specifies that `t` is an input integer and does not provide a mechanism for changing `t` within the loop. Therefore, if `t` is non-zero at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain non-zero, and the loop can execute again without any adjustment.

Given this, and without making any assumptions about changes to `t` within the loop body, the state remains unchanged if `t` is non-zero. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute again, but the task is to ensure the loop can execute one more time, which means `t` must be non-zero.

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an input integer where 0 <= k <= n, each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid, `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` == `r` and 2 for each move where `c` != `r`, `i` is `k` - 1, `c` is the last input integer from the `k` moves, `r` is the last input integer from the `k` moves, `m` is `n` - `num`. If `m` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `m` is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is updated to `m`, and `dp` is a list of `m + 1` integers where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 19, `dp[5]` is 37, and so on up to `dp[m]` with the final value calculated by the loop.**
