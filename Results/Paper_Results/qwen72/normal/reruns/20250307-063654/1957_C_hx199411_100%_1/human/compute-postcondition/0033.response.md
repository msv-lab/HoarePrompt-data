To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m + 1` is greater than 3, meaning `m` must be at least 3. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 3.
2. **`m`**: The loop will execute if `m` is at least 3. Given that `m` is defined as `n - num`, and `n` is at least 1, `num` must be such that `n - num` is at least 3. This means `num` must be less than `n - 2`.

Let's summarize the state adjustments:

- `i` must be 3.
- `m` must be at least 3, which implies `n - num` must be at least 3, so `num` must be less than `n - 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1
- `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5
- `k` is an input integer where 0 <= k <= n
- Each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each move where `c` == `r` and 2 for each move where `c` != `r`
- `i` is `k` - 1
- `c` is the last input integer from the `k` moves
- `r` is the last input integer from the `k` moves
- `m` is `n - num`
- `m` is not equal to 0
- `m` is not equal to 1
- `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

State: **`i` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
