Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input.** 

The values of `c` and `r` are now updated to the integers provided by the user input. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged. The condition for updating `num` based on the equality of `c` and `r` has not yet been executed, so `num` is not affected.
