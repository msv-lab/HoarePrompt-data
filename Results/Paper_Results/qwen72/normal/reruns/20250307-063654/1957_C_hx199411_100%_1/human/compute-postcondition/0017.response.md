The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 2, each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid, `i` is 2, `c` is the first integer from the input, and `r` is the second integer from the input. If `c` == `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.**
