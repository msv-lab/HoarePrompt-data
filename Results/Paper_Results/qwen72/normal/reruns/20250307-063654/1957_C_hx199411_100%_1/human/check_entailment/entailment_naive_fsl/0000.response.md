Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the initial moves (r, c) and (c, r) (if r != c) are already on the board, and the computer's mirrored move results in the same position being occupied by both a white and a black rook. This can lead to incorrect counting of the final configurations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
1 2
2 1
```

In this case, the initial moves are:
- You place a white rook at (1, 2).
- The computer places a black rook at (2, 1).

Now, if you place a white rook at (2, 1), the computer will place a black rook at (1, 2), which is already occupied by a white rook. This move should be invalid, but the program does not account for this scenario and may incorrectly count it as a valid configuration.

The program should ensure that no two rooks (one white and one black) occupy the same position, and it should correctly handle the mirrored moves to avoid double-counting or counting invalid configurations.
