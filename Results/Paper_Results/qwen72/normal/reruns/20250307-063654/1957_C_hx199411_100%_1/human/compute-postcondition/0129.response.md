Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the size of a board `n`, the number of moves `k`, and a list of valid moves `(r_i, c_i)`. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the moves and prints the result. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are the input values for the last test case, `num` is the total number of times the loop has incremented `num` based on the conditions `c == r` (increment by 1) or `c != r` (increment by 2) for the last test case, and `m` is `n - num` for the last test case. If `m` is 0 or 1, the function prints 1. If `m` is at least 3, the function computes and prints a value from a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[m]` is calculated based on a specific recurrence relation. **
