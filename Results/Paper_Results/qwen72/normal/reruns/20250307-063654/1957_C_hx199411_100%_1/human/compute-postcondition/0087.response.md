Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `num` is increased by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is increased by 2, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 50, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`, `t` is `False`.** 

Explanation:
- `n` and `k` are updated with the values provided by the `input()`.
- `i` remains `k - 1`.
- `c` and `r` remain the last input integers from the `k` moves.
- `num` is increased by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is increased by 2.
- `m` is updated to `n - num`.
- `dp` remains a list of length `m + 1` with the specified initial values and the formula for calculating subsequent values.
- `t` remains `False`.
