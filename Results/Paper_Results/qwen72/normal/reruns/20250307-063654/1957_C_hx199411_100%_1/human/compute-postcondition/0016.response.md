Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` must be greater than 1, each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid, `i` is 1, `c` is the first integer from the input, and `r` is the second integer from the input. If `c` == `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.***
