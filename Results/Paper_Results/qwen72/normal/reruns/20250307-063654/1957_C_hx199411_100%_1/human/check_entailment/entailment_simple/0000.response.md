### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the number of already occupied positions.

2. **Counting Occupied Positions:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of positions that are already occupied by rooks.
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`, if `r_i == c_i`, it means the computer cannot mirror this move, so `num` is incremented by 1.
   - If `r_i != c_i`, the computer mirrors the move, so `num` is incremented by 2 (one for the player's move and one for the computer's move).

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining positions on the board where no rooks are placed yet.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations:**
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, there is only one possible configuration (either the board is full or there is only one position left).
   - For `m` greater than 1, the function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For each `i` from 3 to `m`, the DP value is updated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of possible final configurations for each test case.

### Analysis of the DP Formula:
- The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions.
- `dp[i - 1]` represents the number of configurations where the last rook is placed in a way that doesn't create a new row or column.
- `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2` represents the number of configurations where the last rook is placed in a new row or column, and the remaining positions are filled in all possible ways.

### Potential Issues:
- The program correctly handles the input and output for each test case.
- The logic for counting the number of occupied positions and the remaining positions is correct.
- The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the number of possible final configurations.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states. It correctly processes the input, uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations, and handles the modulo operation as required.

Correctness: **True**
