Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.

2. **Tracking Used Rows and Columns**: The program tracks the number of rows and columns that have been used by the player and the computer. It increments `num` by 2 for each move where the row and column are different (since both the player's and the computer's moves are considered), and by 1 for each move where the row and column are the same (since the computer skips its turn).

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**: The program calculates the number of remaining positions `m` that can be used for placing rooks, which is `n - num`.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Permutations**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The `dp` array is used to store the number of valid configurations for a given number of remaining positions. The base cases are:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: Only one position left, and it can be filled in one way.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: Two positions left, and they can be filled in three ways (both white, both black, or one of each).

5. **Recursive Calculation**: For `m > 2`, the program calculates the number of configurations using the recurrence relation:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`

   This relation accounts for:
   - Placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and not placing a rook in the mirrored position.
   - Placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and placing a rook in the mirrored position.

6. **Output**: The program prints the final number of configurations for each test case.

The logic and implementation seem to correctly handle the constraints and the problem requirements, ensuring that the number of configurations is calculated modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Therefore, the program is correct.
