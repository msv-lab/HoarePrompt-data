Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard, given the constraints and the specific game rules. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves, each consisting of a row `r_i` and a column `c_i`.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of positions that are already occupied or mirrored by the computer.
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`, if `r_i == c_i`, it increments `num` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).
   - If `r_i != c_i`, it increments `num` by 2 (since both `(r_i, c_i)` and `(c_i, r_i)` are occupied).

3. **Remaining Positions**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining positions on the board that are not yet occupied by rooks or their mirrors.

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, the program prints 1, as there is only one possible configuration in these cases.
   - For `m` greater than 1, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, which correctly accounts for the possible ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `dp[m]` for each test case, which represents the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The dynamic programming approach and the recurrence relation are appropriate for this problem, as they correctly model the constraints and the game rules. The program handles the edge cases (when `m` is 0 or 1) correctly and uses modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
