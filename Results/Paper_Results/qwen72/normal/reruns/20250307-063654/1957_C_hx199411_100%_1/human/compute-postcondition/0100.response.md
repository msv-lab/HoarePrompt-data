Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `t` is `False`, and `c` and `r` are updated with the last input integers. If `c` == `r`, `num` is 2, and `m` is `n - 2`. If `c` != `r`, `num` is 3, and `m` is `n - 3`. In both cases, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, and `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 50, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`.***
