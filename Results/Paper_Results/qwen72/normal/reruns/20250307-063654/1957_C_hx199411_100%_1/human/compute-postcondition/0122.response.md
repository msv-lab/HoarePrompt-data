Output State: **`dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**

Explanation:
- `dp[i]` is updated to the value of `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` remains valid.
