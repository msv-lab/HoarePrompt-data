Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `k - 1`, where `k` is the initial value of `k`.
   - `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - `m` is `n - num`.
   - `num` is increased by 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is increased by 2.
   - The current value of `m` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the integer `1`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `n`, `m`, and `num`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
