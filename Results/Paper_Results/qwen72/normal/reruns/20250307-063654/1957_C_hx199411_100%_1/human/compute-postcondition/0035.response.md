The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` is at least 3. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `m` must still be at least 4.

State: **`i` is 4, `m` is at least 4, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8**
