Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated with the input values, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are the last input integers from the `k` moves, `num` is the total number of times the loop has incremented `num` based on the conditions `c == r` (increment by 1) or `c != r` (increment by 2), `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26, `dp[5]` is 50, and `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` is calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 10`, `t` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `k`**: These values are set initially and remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`k`**: The loop will execute `k` times, so `k` must be greater than 0.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `k - 1` because the loop iterates from 0 to `k-1`.
- **`c` and `r`**: These are the last input integers from the `k` moves.
- **`num`**: This variable is incremented based on the conditions inside the loop. If `c == r`, `num` is incremented by 1; if `c != r`, `num` is incremented by 2. After `k` iterations, `num` will reflect the total number of increments.
- **`m`**: This is calculated as `n - num` after the loop completes.
- **`dp`**: The list `dp` is initialized with specific values and the rest are calculated using the given formula. The length of `dp` is `m + 1`, and the values are computed as described.
- **`t`**: This variable remains `False` as it is not modified within the loop.
