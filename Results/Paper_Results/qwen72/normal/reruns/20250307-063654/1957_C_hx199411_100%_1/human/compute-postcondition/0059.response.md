The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `k` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `k` must be greater than 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is increased by 2.**
