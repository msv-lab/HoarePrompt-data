Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, and each move (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid.**

The value of `t` is updated to the integer provided by the user input, while the conditions for `n`, `k`, and the moves (r_i, c_i) remain unchanged.
