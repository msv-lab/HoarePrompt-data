### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves, each represented by a pair `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Move Counting:**
   - The function initializes `num` to 0.
   - For each move `(r_i, c_i)`, it increments `num` by 1 if `r_i == c_i` (indicating a diagonal move where the computer skips its turn), and by 2 if `r_i != c_i` (indicating a non-diagonal move where the computer mirrors the move).

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation:**
   - The function calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, the function prints 1 because there is only one way to place rooks in these cases.
   - If `m` is greater than 1, the function uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For `i` from 3 to `m`, the function updates `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result `dp[m]` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Move Counting:**
  - The function correctly counts the number of moves where the computer skips its turn and where it mirrors the move.
  - This ensures that `m` accurately represents the number of remaining positions.

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to calculate the number of valid configurations.
  - This relation is derived from the fact that for each new rook placed, it can either be placed in a way that doesn't affect the previous configuration (hence `dp[i - 1]`), or it can be placed in a way that affects the previous configuration by creating a new pair of non-attacking rooks (hence `(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2`).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles the edge cases where `m` is 0 or 1, printing 1 in both cases.
  - The function also correctly initializes the DP array and updates it for larger values of `m`.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of valid final configurations of rooks on the board, given the constraints and the problem description. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for the problem, and the edge cases are handled correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
