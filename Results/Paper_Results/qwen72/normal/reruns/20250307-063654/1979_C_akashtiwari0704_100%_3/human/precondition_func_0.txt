The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the number of outcomes (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of integers `k` of length `n` where each `k_i` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) represents the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The function should return a list of integers `x` of length `n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, or -1 if no such distribution is possible. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
