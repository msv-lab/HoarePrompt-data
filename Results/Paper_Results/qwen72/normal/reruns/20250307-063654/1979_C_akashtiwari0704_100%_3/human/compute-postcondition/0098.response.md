The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `bets` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `bets` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is now `prod // a[0]`, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`**
