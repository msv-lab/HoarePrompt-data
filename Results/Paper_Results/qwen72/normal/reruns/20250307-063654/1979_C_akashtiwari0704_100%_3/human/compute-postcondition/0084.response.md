Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Since `i` is 1, `g` is now `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`. The values of `i` and the list `l` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `l` must have at least 2 elements is still valid.
