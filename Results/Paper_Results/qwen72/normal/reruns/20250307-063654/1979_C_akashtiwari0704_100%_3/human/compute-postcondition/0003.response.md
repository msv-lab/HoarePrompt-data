The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `l`. If `l` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, and `l` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `l` is a list that must have at least one element, `i` is 0**
