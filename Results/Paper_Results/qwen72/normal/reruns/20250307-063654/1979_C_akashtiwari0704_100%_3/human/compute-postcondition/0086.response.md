Output State: **`i` is 2, `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `g` is updated to `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is 2, and `l` is a list with at least 3 elements. The variable `g` is updated to `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function. The states of `i` and `l` remain unchanged.
