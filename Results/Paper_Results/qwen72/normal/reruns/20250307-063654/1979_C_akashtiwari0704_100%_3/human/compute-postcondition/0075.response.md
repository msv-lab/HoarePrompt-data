Output State: **`bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element is updated to `prod // a[j]` for its respective index `j`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[0]` followed by a space, the value of `a[1]` followed by a space, the value of `a[2]` followed by a space, and now also contains the value of `a[3]` followed by a space.**
