Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `l` is a list that must have at least two elements, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
- The values of `t`, `T`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `l` must have at least two elements is still valid.
- The value of `g` is now the result of the expression `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function.
