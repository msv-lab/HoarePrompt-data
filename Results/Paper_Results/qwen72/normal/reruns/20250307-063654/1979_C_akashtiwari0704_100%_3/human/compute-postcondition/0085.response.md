The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the list `l` and the value of `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `l`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `l` must still have at least 2 elements. However, since the loop is iterating over the length of `l`, `l` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`**
