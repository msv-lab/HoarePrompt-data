Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` representing the number of outcomes (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of integers `k` of length `n` where each `k_i` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) represents the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning. The function should return a list of integers `x` of length `n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) representing the bets on each outcome, or -1 if no such distribution is possible. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `t` is now a specific integer value provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and each `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no additional changes are made. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, and `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for its respective index `j`. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for its respective index `j`, and `ans` is a string containing the values of all elements in `a` separated by spaces, followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` has been updated to `prod // a[j]` for its respective index `j`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a`, and `ans` is a string containing the values of all updated elements in `a` separated by spaces, followed by a space. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current state remains unchanged. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, the function returns `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
