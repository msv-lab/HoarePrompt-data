The code snippet `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` updates the list `a` with new integer values provided by the user. The previous state of `a` is overwritten, and the new values are taken from the user input.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the new `a`, and `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for its respective index `j`. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for its respective index `j`, and `ans` is a string containing the values of all elements in `a` separated by spaces, followed by a space.**
