Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and each `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. Additionally, `sumo` is less than `prod`. `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[0]` followed by a space, and now also contains the value of `a[1]` followed by a space.**
