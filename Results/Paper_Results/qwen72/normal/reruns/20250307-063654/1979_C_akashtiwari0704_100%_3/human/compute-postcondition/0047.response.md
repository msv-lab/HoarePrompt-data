Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[j]` is `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space, `g` is updated to `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`, `l` is a non-empty list with at least one element remaining.**
