Postcondition: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`. Each element in `a` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for its respective index `j`. `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space.**
