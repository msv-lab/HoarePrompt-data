Output State: **`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` has been updated to `prod // a[j]` for its respective index `j`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a`, and `ans` is a string containing the values of all updated elements in `a` separated by spaces, followed by a space.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `bets` remains the same as the input integer.
- The variable `i` is now `bets - 1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `t` is still greater than 1.
- The variable `T` is still 2.
- The list `a` has been updated such that each element `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]`, where `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in `a`.
- The variable `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a`.
- The variable `ans` is a string containing the values of all updated elements in `a`, separated by spaces, followed by a space.
