Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and each `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. Additionally, `sumo` is less than `prod`. `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `bets` remains greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1` (indicating the loop has completed its last iteration), `t` is still greater than 0, `T` is 0, and the list `a` contains the transformed values as described in the initial state. The variable `prod` is still the least common multiple of the original integers in `a`, and `sumo` is still the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, with `sumo` being less than `prod`. The variable `ans` is now a string that contains each element of the transformed list `a`, separated by spaces.
