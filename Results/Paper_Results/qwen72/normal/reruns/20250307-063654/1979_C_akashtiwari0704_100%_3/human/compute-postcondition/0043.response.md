Output State: **`bets` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[j]` is `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space, `g` is updated to `l[0]` if `l[0]` is not 0, otherwise `g` remains 1, `l` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` updates the value of `g`.
- Given `i` is 0, the first element of the list `l` is used.
- The `gcd` function computes the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[0]`.
- The new value of `g` is `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`.
- If `l[0]` is 0, `gcd(g, l[0])` would be 0, leading to a division by zero error. However, since `l` is a non-empty list and `g` is 1, `g` will be updated to `l[0]` if `l[0]` is not 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
