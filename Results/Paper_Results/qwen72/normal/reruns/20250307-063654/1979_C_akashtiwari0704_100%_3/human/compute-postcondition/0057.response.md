Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is 0, and if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space. The value of `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`.**
