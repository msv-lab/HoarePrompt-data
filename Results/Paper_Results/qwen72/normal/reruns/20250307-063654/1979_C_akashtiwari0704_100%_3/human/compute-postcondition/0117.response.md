Postcondition: ***`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` has been updated to `prod // a[j]` for its respective index `j`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the updated elements in `a`, and `ans` is a string containing the values of all updated elements in `a` separated by spaces, followed by a space. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the current state remains unchanged. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, the function returns `ans`.***
