Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, each followed by a space.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads a new list of integers from user input and assigns it to `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, where each `a[j]` is `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. However, after executing the code, `a` is now a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `bets`, `i`, `t`, `T`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet.
- The initial state's condition about `a[j]` being `prod // a[j]` is no longer valid because `a` has been reassigned.
- The initial state's condition about `sumo` and `ans` remains valid, but the specific values of `a` have been updated.
