Output State: **`i` is 0, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The list `l` still has at least 1 element.
- The variable `g` is updated to the result of `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function. This means `g` is now the product of `g` and the first element of `l`, divided by their greatest common divisor.
