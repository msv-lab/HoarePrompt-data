Postcondition: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`. Each element in `a` has been updated to `prod // a[j]` for its respective index `j`.**
