Postcondition: **`i` is 28, `range(0, 29)` has values from 0 to 28, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x`. The loop has completed its execution, and the final state of `s` will depend on the initial values and the transitions that occurred during the loop. The `flag` will be 0 or 1 depending on the last transition. Either `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is '1'.**
