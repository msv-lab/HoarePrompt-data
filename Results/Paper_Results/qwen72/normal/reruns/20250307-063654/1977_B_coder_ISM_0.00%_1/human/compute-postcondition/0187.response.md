Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each of which is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is 1 or 0, `flag` is 0, and the condition `flag and s[i] == '0'` is false.**

Explanation:
- The precondition states that `flag` is 0.
- The if condition `if (flag and s[i] == '0'):` checks if both `flag` is true and `s[i]` is '0'.
- Since `flag` is 0, the condition `flag and s[i] == '0'` is always false.
- Therefore, the postcondition retains all the conditions from the precondition and adds that the if condition is false.
