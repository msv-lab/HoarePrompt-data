Output State: **`i` is 2, `range(0, 29)` has values from 0 to 28, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x`. `flag` is 0, `s[2]` is set to '1'. If `s[1]` was '1' and `s[2]` was '1', then `s[1]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is 1. Otherwise, `s[1]` remains unchanged, and `s[0]` remains unchanged.**
