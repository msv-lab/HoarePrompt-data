Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Output Format**:
   - The program prints the array `s` before it has been fully processed and corrected. This is incorrect because the array `s` needs to be modified to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
   - The program should first modify the array `s` to meet the constraints and then print the length and the array.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**:
   - The logic for handling consecutive non-zero elements is flawed. The program attempts to convert consecutive '1's to '-1' and '0', but it does not correctly handle all cases, especially when there are multiple consecutive '1's.
   - The program also does not correctly handle the case where the last element needs to be adjusted.

3. **Incorrect Length Calculation**:
   - The program assumes a fixed length of 30 for the array `s`, which is not always correct. The length of the array should be determined based on the number of bits required to represent `x` and the adjustments made to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero.

4. **Incorrect Final Adjustment**:
   - The final adjustment logic for the array `s` is incorrect. It does not ensure that the array meets the required constraints and may produce invalid results.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Convert the integer `x` to its binary representation.
2. Adjust the binary representation to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
3. Print the length of the adjusted array and the array itself.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 0
        while x > 0:
            if x & 1:
                if s and s[-1] != 0:
                    s[-1] = -1
                    s.append(1)
                    length += 1
                else:
                    s.append(1)
                    length += 1
            else:
                s.append(0)
            x >>= 1
        if s and s[-1] == 0:
            s.pop()
            length -= 1
        print(length)
        print(*s)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Binary Conversion and Adjustment**:
   - The program converts the integer `x` to its binary representation and processes each bit.
   - If a bit is set (i.e., `1`), and the previous bit is also set, it adjusts the previous bit to `-1` and appends `1` to the array.
   - If a bit is set and the previous bit is not set, it simply appends `1` to the array.
   - If a bit is not set (i.e., `0`), it appends `0` to the array.

2. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The program ensures that the array does not end with a `0` by removing the last `0` if it exists.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the adjusted array and the array itself.

This corrected program should meet the problem's requirements and produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
