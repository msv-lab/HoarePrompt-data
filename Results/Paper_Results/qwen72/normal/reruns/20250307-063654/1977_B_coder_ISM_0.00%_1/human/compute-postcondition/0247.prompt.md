Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    print(*s)
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 28, `length` is 29. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '-1'. Otherwise, `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, and `flag` is 1. The loop has processed all elements of the list `s` from index 1 to 29. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and its preceding element was '1', the '-1' has been changed to '0' and the '1' has been changed to '-1'. The final state of `s` will reflect these changes, and `flag` remains 1 unless the 29th element of `s` is '0' and `flag` was initially 1, in which case `flag` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. If there were any pairs of consecutive elements in `s` where the first element was `'1'` and the second element was `'-1'`, those pairs will have been transformed such that the first element is `'-1'` and the second element is `'0'`. The conditions on `s[29]` and `flag` remain as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
