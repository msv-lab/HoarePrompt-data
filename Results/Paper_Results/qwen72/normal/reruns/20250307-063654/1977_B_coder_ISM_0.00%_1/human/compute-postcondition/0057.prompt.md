Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 29, `range(30)` has been fully iterated. `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from the least significant bit to the 29th bit). If the bit at position `i` in `x` is set to 1, the string at index `i` in `s` is '1'. If the bit at position `i` in `x` is set to 0, the string at index `i` in `s` is '0'. `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `range(0, 29)` has values from 0 to 28, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x`. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', `s[0]` is set to '-1', `s[1]` remains '1', and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[0]` is '0', `s[0]` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains unchanged, and either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `range(0, 29)` has values from 0 to 28, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x`. If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '1' and `s[2]` is '1', then `s[1]` is set to '-1', `flag` is 1, and `s[0]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and `s[1]` is '0', `s[0]` is set to '1'. If neither of these conditions are met, `s[0]` remains unchanged, and either `flag` is not 1, or `s[1]` is not '0', or `s[0]` is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `range(0, 29)` has values from 0 to 28, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x`. If `flag` is 0 and `s[2]` is '1' and `s[3]` is '1', then `s[2]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is 1, while `s[0]` and `s[1]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1 and `s[2]` is '0', then `s[2]` is set to '1'. If `s[1]` was '1' and `s[2]` was '1', then `s[1]` is set to '-1' and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is not 1 or `s[2]` is not '0', then `s[0]`, `s[1]`, and `s[2]` retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
