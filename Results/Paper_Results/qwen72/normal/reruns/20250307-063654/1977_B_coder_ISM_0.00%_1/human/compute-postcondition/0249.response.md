Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (1 â‰¤ x < 2^30) and converts it to a binary string of length 30. It then applies a series of transformation rules to the binary string, which may result in the string being extended to a length of 31. The function prints the original binary string, the final length of the transformed string, and the transformed binary string for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes. **
