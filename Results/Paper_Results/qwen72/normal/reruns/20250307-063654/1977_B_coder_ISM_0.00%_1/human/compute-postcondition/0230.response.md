Postcondition: ***`i` is 28, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', `s[29]` is set to '1', and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', `length` is updated to 31, `s` is a list containing 31 strings where `s[29]` is '0' and `s[30]` is '1', and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0 and there are consecutive '1's in `s`, the first '1' in each pair will be set to '-1', and `flag` will be set to 1. If `flag` is 0 and there are no consecutive '1's in `s`, the values of `s` and `flag` will remain unchanged.***
