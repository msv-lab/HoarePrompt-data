Output State: **`i` is 29, `range(30)` has been fully iterated. `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from the least significant bit to the 29th bit). If the bit at position `i` in `x` is set to 1, the string at index `i` in `s` is '1'. If the bit at position `i` in `x` is set to 0, the string at index `i` in `s` is '0'. `flag` is 0.**
