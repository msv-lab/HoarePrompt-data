Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

- `i` is 28
- `length` is 29
- The condition states that if `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is changed to '0' and `s[i - 1]` is changed to '-1'. Otherwise, `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` retain their original values.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(length)
```

This statement prints the value of the variable `length`. According to the initial state, `length` is explicitly given as 29. The condition and changes to `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` do not affect the value of `length`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **29**
