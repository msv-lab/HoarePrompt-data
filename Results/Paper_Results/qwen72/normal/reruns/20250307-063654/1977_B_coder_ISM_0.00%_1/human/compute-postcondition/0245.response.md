Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

- **Initial State:**
  - `i` is 29.
  - `length` is 30.
  - `nalla` is 2.
  - `t` is greater than 1.
  - `x` is an input integer.
  - `s` is a list containing 30 strings.
  - If there were any pairs of consecutive elements in `s` where the first element was `'1'` and the second element was `'-1'`, those pairs will have been transformed such that the first element is `'-1'` and the second element is `'0'`.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print(length)
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - The `print(length)` statement will print the value of the variable `length`.
  - According to the initial state, `length` is explicitly given as 30.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **30**
