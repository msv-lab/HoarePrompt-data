Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each of which is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is 1 or 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[0]` is '0', then `s[0]` is set to '1' and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged. The current value of `flag` is 0, and the first element of `s` is either '1' or unchanged. Additionally, `s[0]` is equal to `s[1]` and both are '1'.**
