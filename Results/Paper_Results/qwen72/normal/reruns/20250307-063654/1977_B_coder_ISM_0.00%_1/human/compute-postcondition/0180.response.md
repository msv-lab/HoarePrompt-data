Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' depending on whether the bit at position 1 in the binary representation of `x` is 1 or 0, and if the bit at position 2 in the binary representation of `x` is 1, `s` also contains an additional string '1'. Otherwise, `s` also contains an additional string '0'. `s` now has an additional string '1' appended to it. `flag` is 1.**
