Output State: **`i` is 30, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings where the 30th element is '0' and the 29th element is '-1', and `flag` is 1.**

The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the 29th element of the list `s` to '-1'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
