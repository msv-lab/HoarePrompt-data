You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input and Output**:
   - The program should read an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it should read an integer `x` and output an array `a` of length `n` such that:
     - `1 <= n <= 32`
     - Each element `a_i` is either `1`, `0`, or `-1`
     - `x = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \cdot 2^i`
     - No two consecutive elements in `a` are non-zero.

2. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= t <= 10^4`
   - `1 <= x < 2^30`

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` and a variable `length` to 30.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 29 (30 bits) and checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set using `x & pow(2, i)`.
   - If the bit is set, it appends '1' to `s`, otherwise it appends '0'.

3. **Initial Output**:
   - The program prints the list `s` (which is the binary representation of `x`).

4. **Adjusting the Array**:
   - The program initializes a flag to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 28 (29 bits) to adjust the array `s` to meet the problem constraints.
   - If the flag is set and the current bit is '0', it changes the bit to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the flag is not set and the current bit and the next bit are both '1', it changes the current bit to '-1' and sets the flag.
   - If the flag is set and the current bit is not '1', it changes the current bit to '0'.
   - After the loop, if the flag is set and the last bit is '0', it changes the last bit to '1'.
   - If the flag is set and the last bit is not '0', it changes the last bit to '0' and appends '1' to the array, increasing `length` by 1.

5. **Final Adjustments**:
   - The program iterates over the range from 1 to `length - 1` to handle cases where a '-1' is followed by a '1'.
   - If such a case is found, it changes the '-1' to '0' and the '1' to '-1'.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array `s`.
   - It then prints the elements of the array `s`.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Initial Output**:
   - The program prints the list `s` before making any adjustments, which is not required by the problem statement. This is an unnecessary step and should be removed.

2. **Adjusting the Array**:
   - The logic for adjusting the array to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero is complex and may not always produce the correct result.
   - Specifically, the way the flag is used and the final adjustments might not handle all edge cases correctly.

3. **Final Adjustments**:
   - The final adjustments are intended to handle cases where a '-1' is followed by a '1', but the logic might not be robust enough to handle all possible configurations of the array.

### Conclusion:
The program has several issues and does not seem to handle all edge cases correctly. The initial output of the binary representation is unnecessary, and the logic for adjusting the array to meet the problem constraints is not robust enough.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
