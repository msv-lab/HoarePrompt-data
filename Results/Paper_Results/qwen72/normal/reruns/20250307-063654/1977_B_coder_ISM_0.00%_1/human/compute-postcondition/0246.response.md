Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 29.
- `length` is 30.
- `nalla` is 2.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `x` is an input integer (its value is not specified, but it doesn't affect the `print` statement).
- `s` is a list containing 30 strings.
- If there were any pairs of consecutive elements in `s` where the first element was `'1'` and the second element was `'-1'`, those pairs will have been transformed such that the first element is `'-1'` and the second element is `'0'`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(*s)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print(*s)` statement will print all elements of the list `s` separated by spaces.
- The list `s` contains 30 strings.
- The transformation rule states that any consecutive pair of elements in `s` where the first element is `'1'` and the second element is `'-1'` will be changed to `'-1'` and `'0'` respectively.

### Output:
Since the exact values of the elements in `s` are not provided, we can only describe the general structure of the output. The list `s` will contain 30 strings, and any pairs of `'1'` followed by `'-1'` will be transformed to `'-1'` followed by `'0'`.

Output: **s[0] s[1] s[2] ... s[29] (where s is a list of 30 strings, and any consecutive pairs of '1' and '-1' have been transformed to '-1' and '0')**
