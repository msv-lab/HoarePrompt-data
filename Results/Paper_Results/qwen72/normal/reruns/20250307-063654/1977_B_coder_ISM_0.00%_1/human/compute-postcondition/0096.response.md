Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing two strings. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 (which is `2^1`) is non-zero, the second string in `s` is '1'. Otherwise, the second string in `s` is '0'. The first string in `s` remains unchanged.***
