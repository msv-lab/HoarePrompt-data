Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an empty list, `flag` is 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' depending on whether the bit at position `i` (which is 0) in the binary representation of `x` is 1 or 0, and `flag` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' depending on whether the bit at position `i` (which is 1) in the binary representation of `x` is 1 or 0. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, `s` also contains an additional string '1'. Otherwise, `s` also contains an additional string '0'. `flag` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' depending on whether the bit at position 1 in the binary representation of `x` is 1 or 0, and if the bit at position 2 in the binary representation of `x` is 1, `s` also contains an additional string '1'. Otherwise, `s` also contains an additional string '0'. If the bit at position 2 in the binary representation of `x` is 1, `s` has an additional string '1' appended to it. If the bit at position 2 in the binary representation of `x` is 0, `s` has an additional string '0' appended to it. `flag` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
