Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing three strings. The first string in `s` remains unchanged, the second string in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 is non-zero, otherwise it is '0', and the third string in `s` is '1'.**
