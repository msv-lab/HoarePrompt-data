Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 30
   - `length` is 30
   - `nalla` is 1
   - `t` is greater than 1
   - `x` is an input integer (not used in the provided code snippet)
   - `s` is a list containing 30 strings
   - `flag` is 1

2. **Loop Processing:**
   - The loop has processed all elements of the list `s` from index 1 to 29.
   - If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and its preceding element was '1', the '-1' has been changed to '0' and the '1' has been changed to '-1'.
   - The final state of `s` will reflect these changes.
   - `flag` remains 1 unless the 29th element of `s` is '0' and `flag` was initially 1, in which case `flag` is set to 0.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(length)
   ```

4. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(length)` statement will print the value of the variable `length`.
   - According to the initial state, `length` is explicitly given as 30.

Therefore, the output of the `print(length)` statement will be:

Output: **30**
