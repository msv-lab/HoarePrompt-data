The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `length`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop increments `i` and the condition for the loop to continue executing.

1. **Increment of `i`:** The loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
2. **Condition for loop execution:** The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `length`. At the end of the previous iteration, `length` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `length` must be greater than 3.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 3, `length` must be greater than 3. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '-1'. Otherwise, `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` retain their original values.**
