Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' depending on whether the bit at position `i` (which is 1) in the binary representation of `x` is 1 or 0. If the bit at position `i` in the binary representation of `x` is 1, `s` also contains an additional string '1'. Otherwise, `s` also contains an additional string '0'. `flag` is 1.***
