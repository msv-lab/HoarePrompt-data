Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`i` is 28, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings. Each string in `s` represents the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2` raised to the power of the corresponding index `i` (from 0 to 29). If the result is non-zero, the string is '1'; otherwise, the string is '0'. The loop has processed the first 29 elements of the list `s`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `flag` remains 1. The final value of `flag` will depend on the last processed element and the state of `flag` before processing it.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, and `flag` is 1. If the 29th element of `s` is '-1' and the 28th element of `s` is '1', the postcondition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 30, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, and `flag` is 1. If the 29th element of `s` is '-1' and the 28th element of `s` is '1', the 30th element of `s` is '0' and the 29th element remains '-1'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 30, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, and `flag` is 1. If the 29th element of `s` is '-1' and the 28th element of `s` is '1', the 30th element of `s` is '0' and the 29th element remains '-1'. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
