Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each of which is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is 1 or 0. `flag` is 1, and if `s[0]` is '0', then `s[0]` is set to '1' and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged. Additionally, `flag` is not 0 or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
