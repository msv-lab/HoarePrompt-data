The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the range `range(30)`. The loop will execute 30 times, and the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The range `range(30)` remains unchanged, as it specifies the total number of iterations.

State: **`i` is 1, `range(30)` ensures the loop will execute 30 times. If the bit at position `i` in `x` is set to 1, `s` is a list that contains the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list that contains the string '0'.**
