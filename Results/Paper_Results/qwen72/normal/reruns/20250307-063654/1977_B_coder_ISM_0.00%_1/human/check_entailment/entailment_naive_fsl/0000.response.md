Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conversion of the binary representation of `x` into an array that meets the problem's constraints. Specifically, the logic for converting `1` to `-1` and ensuring no consecutive non-zero elements is flawed. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
14
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
0 -1 0 0 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
30
0 -1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

The program prints an array of length 30, which is not within the specified range of 1 to 32, and it does not correctly handle the conversion to ensure the array meets the constraints. The array should be of the minimum length necessary to represent `x` correctly and should not have consecutive non-zero elements.
