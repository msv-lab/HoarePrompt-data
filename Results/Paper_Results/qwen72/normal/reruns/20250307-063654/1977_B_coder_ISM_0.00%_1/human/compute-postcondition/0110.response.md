Output State: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2` raised to the power of the corresponding index `i` (from 0 to 29). If the result is non-zero, the string is '1'; otherwise, the string is '0'. `flag` is 0, `s[0]` is '-1', `s[1]` is '1'.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` updates the value of `s[0]` to '-1'. The initial state specified that `s[0]` and `s[1]` were both '1'. After the code execution, `s[0]` is now '-1', while `s[1]` remains '1'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
