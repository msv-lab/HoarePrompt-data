The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `length`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `length` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `length` must still be greater than `i` (so `length` must be greater than 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `length` is greater than 2. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is '0' and `s[i - 1]` is '-1'. Otherwise, `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` retain their original values.**
