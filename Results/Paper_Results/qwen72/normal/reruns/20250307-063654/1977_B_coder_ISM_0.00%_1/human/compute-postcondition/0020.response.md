To determine what will be printed by the `print(*s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 29.
- `range(30)` has been fully iterated, meaning that the loop has run from 0 to 29.
- `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from the least significant bit to the 29th bit).
- If the bit at position `i` in `x` is set to 1, the string at index `i` in `s` is '1'.
- If the bit at position `i` in `x` is set to 0, the string at index `i` in `s` is '0'.

### Explanation:
- The list `s` contains 30 strings, where each string represents a bit of the integer `x`.
- The bits are indexed from 0 to 29, with the least significant bit (rightmost bit) at index 0 and the most significant bit (leftmost bit) at index 29.
- Since `range(30)` has been fully iterated, all 30 positions in the list `s` have been filled with either '1' or '0' based on the corresponding bit in `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*s)
```
- The `print(*s)` statement will unpack the list `s` and print each element separated by a space.

### Output:
- The output will be a sequence of 30 characters, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary form of the integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact sequence of '1's and '0's. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **30 characters, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary form of the integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit**.
