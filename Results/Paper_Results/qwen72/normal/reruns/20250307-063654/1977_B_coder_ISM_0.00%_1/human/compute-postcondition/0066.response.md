Postcondition: ***`i` is 28, `range(0, 29)` has values from 0 to 28, `s` is a list of 30 or 31 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is updated to '1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[30]` is '1' and the length of `s` is increased by 1. If `flag` is 0, then `s[29]` is '1'.***
