Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `range(0, 29)` has values from 0 to 28, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x`. If `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` is '1' and `s[1]` is '1', `s[0]` is set to '-1', `s[1]` remains '1', and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is 1 and `s[0]` is '0', `s[0]` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains unchanged, and either `flag` is not 0, or `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, or `s[0]` is not '1'.***
