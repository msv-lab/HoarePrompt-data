Output State: **`i` is 30, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an empty list, `flag` is 1**

The code snippet `length = 30` does not change the value of `length` because it was already 30 in the initial state. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
