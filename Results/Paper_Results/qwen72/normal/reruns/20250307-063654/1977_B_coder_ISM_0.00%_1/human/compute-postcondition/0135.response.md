Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2` raised to the power of the corresponding index `i` (from 0 to 29). If the result is non-zero, the string is '1'; otherwise, the string is '0'. `s[2]` is '0'. `flag` remains 1 if `s[1]` is '1' or `s[1]` and `s[2]` are not both '1'. If `flag` was 0 and `s[1]` and `s[2]` were both '1', then `s[1]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1.**
