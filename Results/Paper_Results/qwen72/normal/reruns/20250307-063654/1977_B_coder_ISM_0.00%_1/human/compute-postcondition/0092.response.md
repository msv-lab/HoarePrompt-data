Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing a single string. If the bitwise AND of `x` and `2` raised to the power of `i` (which is 1) is non-zero, `s` contains the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` contains the string '0'.***
