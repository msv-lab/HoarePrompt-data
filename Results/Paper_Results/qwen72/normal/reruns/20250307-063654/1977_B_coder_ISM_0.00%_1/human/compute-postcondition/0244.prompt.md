Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`i` is 28, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', `s[29]` is set to '1', and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is not '0', `length` is updated to 31, `s` is a list containing 31 strings where `s[29]` is '0' and `s[30]` is '1', and `flag` remains 1. If `flag` is 0 and there are consecutive '1's in `s`, the first '1' in each pair will be set to '-1', and `flag` will be set to 1. If `flag` is 0 and there are no consecutive '1's in `s`, the values of `s` and `flag` will remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings. If `s[1]` is `'-1'` and `s[0]` is `'1'`, then `s[1]` is set to `'0'` and `s[0]` is set to `'-1'`. The conditions on `s[29]` and `flag` remain as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings. If `s[1]` is `'-1'` and `s[0]` is `'1'`, then `s[0]` is set to `'-1'` and `s[1]` is set to `'0'`. The conditions on `s[29]` and `flag` remain as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings. If `s[3]` is `'-1'` and `s[2]` is `'1'`, then `s[2]` is set to `'-1'` and `s[3]` is set to `'0'`. The conditions on `s[29]` and `flag` remain as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
