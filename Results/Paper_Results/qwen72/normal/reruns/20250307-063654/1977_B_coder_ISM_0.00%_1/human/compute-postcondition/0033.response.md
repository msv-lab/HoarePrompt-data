Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `range(0, 29)` has values from 0 to 28, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x`, and `flag` is 0. The current value of `s[i]` remains unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
