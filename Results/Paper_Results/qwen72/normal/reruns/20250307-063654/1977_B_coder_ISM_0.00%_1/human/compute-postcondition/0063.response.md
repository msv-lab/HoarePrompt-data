Output State: **`i` is 28, `range(0, 29)` has values from 0 to 28, `s` is a list of 31 strings, each representing the bit at the corresponding position in `x`, `flag` is 1, `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1'.**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string '1' to the end of the list `s`. Initially, `s` was a list of 30 strings, and now it has 31 strings. The other variables (`i`, `range(0, 29)`, `flag`, and `s[29]`) remain unchanged.
