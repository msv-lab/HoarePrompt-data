Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each representing the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and `2` raised to the power of the corresponding index `i` (from 0 to 29). If the result is non-zero, the string is '1'; otherwise, the string is '0'. `flag` is 1, and either `s[0]` is not '1', or `s[0]` and `s[1]` are not both '1'.**
