Output State: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each of which is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is 1 or 0. The current value of `flag` is 1, and the first element of `s` is now '-1'. Additionally, `s[0]` is no longer equal to `s[1]`, and `s[1]` is '1'.**
