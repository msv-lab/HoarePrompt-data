Output State: **`i` is 28, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 31 strings where `s[29]` is '0' and `s[30]` is '1', `flag` is 1.** 

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string '1' to the end of the list `s`, increasing its length from 30 to 31. The new element is `s[30]` which is '1'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
