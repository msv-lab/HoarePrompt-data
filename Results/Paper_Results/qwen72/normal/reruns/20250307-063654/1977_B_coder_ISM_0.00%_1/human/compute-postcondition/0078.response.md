Output State: **`i` is 3, `length` must be greater than 3. `s[i]` is '0'. `s[i - 1]` is '-1'.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[i - 1]` to '-1'. Given that `i` is 3, `s[2]` is now '-1'. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged: `i` is still 3, `length` is still greater than 3, and `s[i]` (which is `s[3]`) is still '0'.
