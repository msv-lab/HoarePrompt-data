Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, where `s[1]` is now '1', and if `flag` is 0 and `s[0]` and `s[1]` are both '1', then `s[0]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[0]` remains unchanged and either `flag` is 0, or `s[0]` is not '1', or `s[0]` and `s[1]` are not both '1'.**
