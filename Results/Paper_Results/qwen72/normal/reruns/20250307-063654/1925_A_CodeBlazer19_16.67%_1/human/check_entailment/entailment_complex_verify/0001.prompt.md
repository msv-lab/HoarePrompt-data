You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = ''
        
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0, `s` is the string containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a', `j` is `k + 96`, and `k + 97` is greater than `k + 96`. If `k` is 1, `s` contains the character 'a' and `j` is 97. If `k` is greater than 1, `s` contains the characters from 'a' to the character with ASCII value `k + 96` and `j` is `k + 96`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26) from the input. It then constructs a string `s` containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a'. If `k` is 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints the string `s` repeated twice if `n` is greater than 1, and once if `n` is 1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0 and `i` being `t - 1`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `s` are reset for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
- The string `s` should be the shortest possible.
- If there are multiple shortest strings, any one of them is acceptable.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **String Generation:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `s`.
   - It then constructs the string `s` by concatenating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This is done using a loop that iterates from `97` to `97 + k - 1` and converts each integer to its corresponding character using `chr(j)`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `n * s`. This is correct because when `k == 1`, the only possible string of length `n` is a repetition of the single character `s`.
   - If `k != 1`, the program prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`. This expression evaluates to:
     - `2 * s` if `n != 1`
     - `1 * s` if `n == 1`

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Case 1: `k == 1`**
  - When `k == 1`, the only possible string of length `n` is `s * n`, where `s` is the single character. The program correctly prints `n * s`.

- **Case 2: `k != 1`**
  - When `k != 1`, the program prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`.
  - If `n == 1`, the program prints `s` (i.e., the first `k` characters once). This is correct because all possible strings of length 1 using the first `k` characters are subsequences of `s`.
  - If `n != 1`, the program prints `2 * s` (i.e., the first `k` characters twice). This is incorrect because it does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences of `s`.

### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1: `n = 1, k = 2`**
  - Possible strings: `a`, `b`
  - Program output: `ab`
  - Correct: `a` and `b` are both subsequences of `ab`.

- **Test Case 2: `n = 2, k = 1`**
  - Possible string: `aa`
  - Program output: `aa`
  - Correct: `aa` is a subsequence of `aa`.

- **Test Case 3: `n = 2, k = 2`**
  - Possible strings: `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`
  - Program output: `abab`
  - Incorrect: `abab` does not contain `ba` as a subsequence.

- **Test Case 4: `n = 2, k = 3`**
  - Possible strings: `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`
  - Program output: `abcbac`
  - Incorrect: `abcbac` does not contain all possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 characters as subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly generate a string `s` that contains all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets as subsequences, especially for cases where `n > 1` and `k > 1`.

Correctness: **False**
