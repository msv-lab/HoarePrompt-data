Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **String Construction**: The program constructs the string `s` by concatenating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This is correct for the initial part of the string, but the logic for constructing the final string `s` is flawed.

2. **Handling k == 1**: When `k == 1`, the program correctly prints `n * s` because there is only one character to use, and the string should be repeated `n` times.

3. **General Case**: For the general case where `k > 1`, the program prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`. This logic is incorrect because it only prints the string `s` once if `n == 1` and twice if `n > 1`. This does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the output string.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, we need to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the output string. One way to achieve this is to construct a string that contains all possible combinations of the first `k` characters in a way that ensures all subsequences of length `n` are present.

For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `abcbac` is correct because it contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using the characters `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(n * chr(97))
        else:
            # Construct the string that contains all possible subsequences of length n
            s = ''.join(chr(97 + j) for j in range(k)) * n
            print(s)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **k == 1**: If `k == 1`, the only character available is `a`, so the string should be `a` repeated `n` times.
- **k > 1**: For `k > 1`, we construct a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` by repeating the sequence of the first `k` characters `n` times. This ensures that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in the string.

### Example:
For the input:
```
4
1 2
2 1
2 2
2 3
```

The output will be:
```
ab
aa
abab
abcabc
```

This output is correct because:
- For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the string `ab` contains both `a` and `b`.
- For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the string `aa` contains the only possible subsequence `aa`.
- For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `abab` contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using `a` and `b`.
- For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `abcabc` contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Thus, the corrected program ensures that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in the output string.
