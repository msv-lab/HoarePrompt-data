The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1. `s` is the string containing the first `k` characters of the ASCII table starting from 'a', `j` is `k + 96`, and `k + 97` is greater than or equal to `k + 97`.**
