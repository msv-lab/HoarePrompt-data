Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is the string containing the first `k` characters of the ASCII table starting from 'a', `j` is `k + 96`, and `k + 97` must be greater than or equal to `k + 97`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n` and `k` remain as input integers, with `k` still being greater than 0.
- The variable `s` is now a string that contains the first `k` characters of the ASCII table starting from 'a'. For example, if `k` is 5, `s` will be 'abcde'.
- The variable `j` will be `k + 96` after the loop has completed all its iterations. This is because the loop starts with `j` at 97 and increments `j` by 1 for each iteration until `j` reaches `k + 97`.
- The condition `k + 97` must be greater than or equal to `k + 97` is always true, ensuring that the loop has executed the required number of times.
