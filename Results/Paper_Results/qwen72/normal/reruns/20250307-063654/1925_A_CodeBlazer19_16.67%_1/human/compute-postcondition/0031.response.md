The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0, `s` is a string containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a', `j` is `k + 96`, and `k + 97` is greater than `k + 96`. If `k` is 1, `s` is 'a' and `j` is 97. Otherwise, `s` contains the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a' and `j` is `k + 96`.**
