The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `97` and `k + 97`. For the loop to execute, `k + 97` must be greater than `97`. This is already implied by the condition that `k` is greater than 0. However, the initial state of `j` must be set to 97 for the loop to start correctly.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0, `s` is an empty string, `j` is 97, and `k + 97` is greater than `97`**
