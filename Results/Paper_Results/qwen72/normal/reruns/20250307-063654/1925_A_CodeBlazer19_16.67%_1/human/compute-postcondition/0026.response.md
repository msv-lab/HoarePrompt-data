Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is 1, `s` is a string containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a' (which means `s` is 'a'), `j` is `k + 96` (which means `j` is 97), and `k + 97` is greater than `k + 96` (which means 98 is greater than 97).**
