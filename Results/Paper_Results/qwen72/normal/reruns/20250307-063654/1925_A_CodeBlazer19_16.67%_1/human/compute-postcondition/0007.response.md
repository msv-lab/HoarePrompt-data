The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is 98, `chr(98)` returns the character 'b'. Therefore, `s` changes from 'a' to 'ab'. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is 'ab', `j` is 98, and `k + 97` must be greater than 98.**
