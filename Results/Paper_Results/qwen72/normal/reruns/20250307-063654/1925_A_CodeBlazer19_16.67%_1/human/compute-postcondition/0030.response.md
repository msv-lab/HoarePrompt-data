Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0, `s` is a string containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a', `j` is `k + 96`, and `k + 97` is greater than `k + 96`. If `k` is 1, `s` is 'a' and `j` is 97. Otherwise, `s` contains the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a' and `j` is `k + 96`.***
