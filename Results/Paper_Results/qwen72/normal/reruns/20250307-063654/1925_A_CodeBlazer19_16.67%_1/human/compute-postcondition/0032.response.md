The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state provides some conditions and values for the variables, but this code snippet will override the values of `n` and `k` with the new input values. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged unless they are dependent on the new values of `n` or `k`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0, `s` is a string containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a', `j` is `k + 96`, and `k + 97` is greater than `k + 96`. If `k` is 1, `s` is 'a' and `j` is 97. Otherwise, `s` contains the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a' and `j` is `k + 96`.**
