Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `s` is a string containing the character 'a', `j` is 97, and `k + 97` is greater than 97.**

The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` (which is 97, corresponding to the character 'a') to the string `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty string, it now contains the character 'a'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
