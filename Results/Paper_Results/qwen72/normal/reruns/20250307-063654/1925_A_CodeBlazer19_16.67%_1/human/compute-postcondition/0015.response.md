Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0. If `k` is 1, `s` is the string 'a', `j` is 97, and `k + 97` is 98. Otherwise, `s` is the string containing the first `k` characters of the ASCII table starting from 'a', `j` is `k + 96`, and `k + 97` is greater than or equal to `k + 97`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 1.***
