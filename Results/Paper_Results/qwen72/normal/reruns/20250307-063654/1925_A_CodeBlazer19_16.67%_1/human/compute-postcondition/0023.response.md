The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `k`, and the range parameters `97` and `k + 97`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `k + 97`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is greater than 1 (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `i` is 1 (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1 (not in the loop head, so they remain unchanged).
- `s` is a string containing 'a' followed by 'b' (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `j` is 98.
- `k + 97` is greater than 98.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `k + 97` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is 99.
- `k + 97` must be greater than 99.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `s` is a string containing 'a' followed by 'b', `j` is 99, and `k + 97` is greater than 99**
