The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `k`, and the range defined by `97` and `k + 97`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop index `j` changes and the condition under which the loop continues to execute.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
- `i` is 0 (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
- `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 0 (not in the loop head, so they remain unchanged)
- `s` is 'a' (not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
- `j` is 97

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop index `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 98.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `k + 97`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is 'a', `j` is 98, and `k + 97` must be greater than 98**
