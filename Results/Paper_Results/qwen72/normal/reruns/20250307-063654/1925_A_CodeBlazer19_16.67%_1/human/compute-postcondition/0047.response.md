The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, both within the range 1 to 26, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
