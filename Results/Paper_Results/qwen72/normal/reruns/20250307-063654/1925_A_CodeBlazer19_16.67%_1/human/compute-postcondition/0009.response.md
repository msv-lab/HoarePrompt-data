Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is 'ab' + 'c', `j` is 99, and `k + 97` must be greater than 99**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 99, `chr(99)` is 'c'. Therefore, `s` becomes 'ab' + 'c', which is 'abc'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and the condition `k + 97` > 99 remain unchanged.
