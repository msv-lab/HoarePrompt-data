Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `s` is a string containing 'a' followed by 'b', `j` is 98, and `k + 97` is greater than 98.**

The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character 'b' (since `chr(98)` is 'b') to the string `s`, which initially contains 'a'. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
