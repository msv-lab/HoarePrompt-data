The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `k`, and the range expression `range(97, k + 97)`. Therefore, we can only adjust `j` and `k` to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is 98
- `k + 97` is greater than 98

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `k + 97` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is 99
- `k + 97` must be greater than 99

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0, `s` is now the string 'a' + 'c', `j` is 99, and `k + 97` is greater than 99**
