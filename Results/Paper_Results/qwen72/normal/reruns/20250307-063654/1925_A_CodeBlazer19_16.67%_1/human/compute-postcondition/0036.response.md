The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `k`, and the integer `97`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `k + 97`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 97, `k` is greater than 0, and `k + 97` is greater than 97. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is now 98, and `k + 97` must still be greater than `j` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0, `s` is now the string 'a', `j` is 98, and `k + 97` is greater than 98**
