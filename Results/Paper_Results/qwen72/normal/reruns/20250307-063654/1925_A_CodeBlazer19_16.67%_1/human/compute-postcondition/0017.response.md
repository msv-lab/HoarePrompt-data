Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `s` is the string containing the first `k` characters of the ASCII table starting from 'a', `j` is `k + 96`, and `k + 97` is greater than or equal to `k + 97`.** 

The values of `n` and `k` are now the input integers provided by the user, and the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
