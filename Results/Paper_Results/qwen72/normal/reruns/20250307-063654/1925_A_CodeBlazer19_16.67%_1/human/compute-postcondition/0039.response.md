Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0, `s` is now the string 'a' + 'c' + 'c', `j` is 99, and `k + 97` is greater than 99.**

The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` (which is 99) to the string `s`. Since `s` was initially 'ac', it becomes 'acc' after the execution. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition `k + 97` is greater than 99 is still valid.
