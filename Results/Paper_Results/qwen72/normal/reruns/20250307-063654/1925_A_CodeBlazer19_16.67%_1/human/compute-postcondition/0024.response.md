The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is 99, `chr(99)` is the character 'c'. Therefore, the string `s`, which initially contains 'a' followed by 'b', will now contain 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition `k + 97` is greater than 99 is still valid.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `s` is a string containing 'a', 'b', and 'c', `j` is 99, and `k + 97` is greater than 99.**
