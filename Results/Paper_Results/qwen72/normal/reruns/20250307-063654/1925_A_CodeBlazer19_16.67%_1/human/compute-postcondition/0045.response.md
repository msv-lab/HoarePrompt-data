Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is the string containing the characters from 'a' to the character with ASCII value `k + 96`, `j` is `k + 96`, and `k + 97` is greater than `k + 96`. If `k` is 1, `s` contains the character 'a' and `j` is 97. If `k` is greater than 1, `s` contains the characters from 'a' to the character with ASCII value `k + 96` and `j` is `k + 96`.***
