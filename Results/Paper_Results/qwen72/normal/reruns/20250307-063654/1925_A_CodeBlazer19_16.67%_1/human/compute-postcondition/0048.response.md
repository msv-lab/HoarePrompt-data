Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26) from the input. It then constructs a string `s` containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a'. If `k` is 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints the string `s` repeated twice if `n` is greater than 1, and once if `n` is 1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0 and `i` being `t - 1`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `s` are reset for each test case. **
