Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is 'a', `j` is 97**

The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character representation of the integer `j` (which is 97) to the string `s`. The character with ASCII value 97 is 'a', so `s` becomes 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.
