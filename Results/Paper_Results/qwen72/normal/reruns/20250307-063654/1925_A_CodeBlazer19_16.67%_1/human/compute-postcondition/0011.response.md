Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 0, `k` is 1, `s` is the string containing the first `k` (which is 1) characters of the ASCII table starting from 'a' (so `s` is 'a'), `j` is `k + 96` (which is 97), and `k + 97` must be greater than or equal to `k + 97` (which is 98).**
