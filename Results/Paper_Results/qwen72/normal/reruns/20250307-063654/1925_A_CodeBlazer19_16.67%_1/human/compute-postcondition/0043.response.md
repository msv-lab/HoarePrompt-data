Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0, `s` is the string containing the characters from 'a' to the character with ASCII value `k + 96`, `j` is `k + 96`, and `k + 97` is greater than `k + 96`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 1.**
