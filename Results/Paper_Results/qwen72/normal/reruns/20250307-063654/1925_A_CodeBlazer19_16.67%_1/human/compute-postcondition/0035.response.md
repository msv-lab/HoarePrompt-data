Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0, `s` is now the string 'a', `j` is 97, and `k + 97` is greater than `97`**

The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` (which is 97) to the string `s`. The ASCII value 97 corresponds to the character 'a'. Therefore, `s` is now the string 'a'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition `k + 97` is greater than `97` also remains valid.
