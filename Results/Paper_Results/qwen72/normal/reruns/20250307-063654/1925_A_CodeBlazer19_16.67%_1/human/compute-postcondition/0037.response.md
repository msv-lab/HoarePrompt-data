Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than 0, `s` is now the string 'a' + 'c', `j` is 98, and `k + 97` is greater than 98.**

The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Since `j` is 98, `chr(98)` returns the character 'b'. Therefore, `s` is updated to 'a' + 'b', which is 'ab'. However, the correct ASCII character for 98 is 'b', but the initial state mentioned `s` is 'a', and the output state should reflect the correct concatenation. The correct updated value of `s` is 'a' + 'b', which is 'ab'. The other variables remain unchanged.
