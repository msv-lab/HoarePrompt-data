The only objects in the loop head are variables `j`, `k`, and the range defined by `97` and `k + 97`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `k + 97`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 98 and `k + 97` must be greater than 98.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 99.
- For the loop to continue, `k + 97` must be greater than 99.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is 'ab', `j` is 99, and `k + 97` must be greater than 99**
