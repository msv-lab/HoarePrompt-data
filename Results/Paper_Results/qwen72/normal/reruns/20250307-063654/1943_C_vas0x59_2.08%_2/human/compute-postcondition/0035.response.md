Postcondition: ***`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, `n` is the value of `previous[previous[path_ba[-1]]]`, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function with `a` as the input, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used), `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, n]`. If `n` is -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of the variables.***
