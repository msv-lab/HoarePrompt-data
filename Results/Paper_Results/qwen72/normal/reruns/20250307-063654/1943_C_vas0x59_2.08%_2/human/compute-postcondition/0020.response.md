Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, and `n` is unchanged.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `u2vs` will be a list of `n` lists. Each list at index `i` will contain the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i+1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is only used to determine the number of iterations of the loop and is not modified within the loop. The loop constructs an adjacency list representation of a graph, where each edge is represented by a pair of nodes `(u, v)` that are connected, and both `u` and `v` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to fit the 0-based indexing of the list.
