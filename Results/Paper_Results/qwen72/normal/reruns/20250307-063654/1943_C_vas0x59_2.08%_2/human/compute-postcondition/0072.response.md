Functionality: ** The function `func_15` reads the number of vertices and edges of a tree from standard input. It then constructs a path from a node `b` back to a node `a` using a previously computed `previous` array. The function generates a series of operations based on the length of this path. If the path length is odd, it creates operations centered around the middle node of the path. If the path length is even, it creates operations involving the two middle nodes. Finally, the function prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, formatted as pairs of node indices. The function does not return any value. **
