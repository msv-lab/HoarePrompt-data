The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n - 1` and `n` is greater than 1. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be `n - 1 + 1` which simplifies to `n`.

However, the loop condition is `_ in range(n - 1)`, which means `_` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `_` must be `n - 2` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v` appended to it, and the list at index `v` now contains the value `u` appended to it. `n` is greater than 1, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `_` is `n - 2`.**
