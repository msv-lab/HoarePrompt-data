Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, `n` is unchanged, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function with `a` as the input, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used), `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` back to `a` in reverse order, ending with `-1` if `a` is unreachable from `b`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, ..., `(c1, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` (an integer), `c1` is `c2 - 1`, and the length of `path_ba` is even.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2. This means it will run for every odd index from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`.
- In each iteration, the loop appends two tuples to the `ops` list: `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.
- Since the loop runs for every odd index from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`, the final `ops` list will contain all such tuples.
- The values of `c1` and `c2` remain unchanged throughout the loop, with `c1` being `c2 - 1` and `c2` being half the length of `path_ba`.
- The length of `path_ba` is even, so the loop will run for `len(path_ba) // 2 - 1` iterations, appending two tuples per iteration.
