The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `u2vs` is not directly relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` must be greater than 1**
