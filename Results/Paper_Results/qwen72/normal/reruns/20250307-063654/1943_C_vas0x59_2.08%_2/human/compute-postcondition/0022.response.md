Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, `n` is unchanged, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used), `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**

Explanation:
- `u2vs` remains a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `d` is still the distance array returned by the `bfs` function.
- `_` is still the second value returned by the `bfs` function, which is not used.
- `a` is now assigned the result of calling `func_1(d)`, where `d` is the distance array. The specific value of `a` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the contents of `d`.
