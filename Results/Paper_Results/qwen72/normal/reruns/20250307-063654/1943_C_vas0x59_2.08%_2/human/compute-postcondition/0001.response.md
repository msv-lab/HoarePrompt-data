Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive).**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list containing `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is an empty list, and the length of `u2vs` is equal to `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive).
