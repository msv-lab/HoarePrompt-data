Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v-1` contains the value `u-1` appended to it, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `_` is `n - 1`.**

The value of `v` is decremented by 1, so it is now the second integer input minus 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
