The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `n - 1` is greater than the current value of `_`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `_` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop iterates `n - 1` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `n - 1`.

Given that `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, and assuming `_` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, after the previous iteration, `_` would be `n - 2` (since the loop has executed `n - 2` times so far). For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to `n - 1`.

State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` (after `v` is decreased by 1) now contains the value `u` (after `u` is decreased by 1) appended to it, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is decreased by 1, `_` is `n - 1`**
