Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function with `a` as the input, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used), `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.
- All other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`) remain unchanged.
