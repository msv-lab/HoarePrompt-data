To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`.
2. `n` is unchanged.
3. `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function with `a` as the input.
4. `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function.
5. `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used).
6. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
7. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
8. `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` back to `a` in reverse order, ending with `-1` if `a` is unreachable from `b`.
9. `ops` is a list of tuples:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd and at least 1, `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the node at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, ..., `(c1, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `ops`**:
   - The list `ops` is constructed based on the length of `path_ba`.
   - If `path_ba` is odd and at least 1, `ops` contains tuples where the first element is the middle node `c` and the second element ranges from 0 to `ci`.
   - If `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples where the first elements are `c1` and `c2` (the two middle nodes), and the second element ranges from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` in steps of 2.

2. **Mapping and Printing**:
   - The `map` function applies the lambda function to each tuple in `ops`.
   - The lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` formats each tuple `(node, step)` into a string where the node is incremented by 1 and the step remains the same.
   - The `print` function then prints each formatted string on a new line using `sep='\n'`.

### Output Determination:
- **Odd Length `path_ba`**:
  - If `path_ba` has an odd length, let's say `path_ba = [b, ..., c, ..., a]` where `c` is the middle node.
  - The middle index `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
  - `ops` will contain tuples like `[(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci)]`.
  - The `print` statement will output:
    ```
    c + 1 0
    c + 1 1
    ...
    c + 1 ci
    ```

- **Even Length `path_ba`**:
  - If `path_ba` has an even length, let's say `path_ba = [b, ..., c1, c2, ..., a]` where `c1` and `c2` are the two middle nodes.
  - `c2` is `len(path_ba) // 2` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
  - `ops` will contain tuples like `[(c1, 1), (c2, 1), (c1, 3), (c2, 3), ..., (c1, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1), (c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)]`.
  - The `print` statement will output:
    ```
    c1 + 1 1
    c2 + 1 1
    c1 + 1 3
    c2 + 1 3
    ...
    c1 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)
    c2 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)
    ```

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `path_ba` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure and the values derived from the initial state.

Output: **[c + 1 0, c + 1 1, ..., c + 1 ci] (if path_ba has an odd length) or [c1 + 1 1, c2 + 1 1, c1 + 1 3, c2 + 1 3, ..., c1 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1), c2 + 1 (len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)] (if path_ba has an even length)**

Where:
- `c` is the node at the middle index of `path_ba` if the length is odd.
- `c1` and `c2` are the two middle nodes of `path_ba` if the length is even.
