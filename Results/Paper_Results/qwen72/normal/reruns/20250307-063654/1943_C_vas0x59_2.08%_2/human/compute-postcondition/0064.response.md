Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, `n` is unchanged, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function with `a` as the input, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used), `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` back to `a` in reverse order, ending with `-1` if `a` is unreachable from `b`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and now also contains the tuples `(c2, 3)` and `(c1, i)`, `c2` is 4, `c1` is 3, `i` is 5, and the length of `path_ba` is even and at least 8.**
