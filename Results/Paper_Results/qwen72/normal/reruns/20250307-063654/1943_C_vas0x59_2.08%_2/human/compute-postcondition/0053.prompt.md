Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, `n` is unchanged, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function with `a` as the input, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used), `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` back to `a` in reverse order, ending with `-1` if `a` is unreachable from `b`, `ops` is an empty list, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is the node at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, `n` is unchanged, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function with `a` as the input, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used), `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` back to `a` in reverse order, ending with `-1` if `a` is unreachable from `b`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, 0)`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is the node at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number and must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `ci` is at least 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, `n` is unchanged, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function with `a` as the input, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used), `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` back to `a` in reverse order, ending with `-1` if `a` is unreachable from `b`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is the node at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number and must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `ci` is at least 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, `n` is unchanged, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function with `a` as the input, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used), `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` back to `a` in reverse order, ending with `-1` if `a` is unreachable from `b`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`, `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, and `c` is the node at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`. The length of `path_ba` is an odd number and must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `ci` is at least 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
