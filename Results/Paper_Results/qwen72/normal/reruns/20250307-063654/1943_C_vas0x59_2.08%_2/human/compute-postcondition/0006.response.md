Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` (after `u` is decreased by 1) now contains the value `v` (after `v` is decreased by 1), `n` must be greater than 1, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` (after it has been decreased by 1) to the list at index `u` (after `u` has been decreased by 1) in the list `u2vs`.
- The initial state specifies that `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `u` and `v` are both decreased by 1 before the code is executed.
- After the code is executed, the list at index `u` in `u2vs` now contains the value `v`.
- The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
