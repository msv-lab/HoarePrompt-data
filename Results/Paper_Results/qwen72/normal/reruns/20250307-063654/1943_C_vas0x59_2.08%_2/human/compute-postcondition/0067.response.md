Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, `n` is unchanged, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function with `a` as the input, `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used), `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` back to `a` in reverse order, ending with `-1` if `a` is unreachable from `b`, `ops` is a list of tuples. If the length of `path_ba` is odd and at least 1, `ops` contains the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the node at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, ..., `(c1, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
