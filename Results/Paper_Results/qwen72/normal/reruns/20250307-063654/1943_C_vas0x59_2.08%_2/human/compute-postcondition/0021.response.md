Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`, `n` is unchanged, `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function, and `_` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function (which is not used).** 

The `bfs` function is called with the starting node `0`, and it returns two values, where `d` is assigned the first value (typically the distance array from the starting node to all other nodes), and the second value is ignored. The `u2vs` and `n` variables remain unchanged.
