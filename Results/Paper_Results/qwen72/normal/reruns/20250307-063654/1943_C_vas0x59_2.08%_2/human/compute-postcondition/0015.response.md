Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v` appended to it, and the list at index `v` now contains the value `u` appended to it. `n` is greater than 1, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `_` is `n - 2`.**

The code snippet `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` updates the values of `u` and `v` based on the user input. The new value of `u` is the first integer input minus 1, and the new value of `v` is the second integer input minus 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
