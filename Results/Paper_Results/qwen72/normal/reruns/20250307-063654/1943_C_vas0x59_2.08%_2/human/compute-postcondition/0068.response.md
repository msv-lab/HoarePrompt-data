To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ops))` statement, we need to analyze the structure and conditions of the `ops` list based on the given initial state and the logic described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `u2vs` and `n`**:
   - `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes connected to node `i+1`.
   - `n` is the number of nodes in the graph.

2. **Understanding `d` and `previous`**:
   - `d` is the distance array returned by the `bfs` function with `a` as the input.
   - `previous` is the second value returned by the `bfs` function, which is not used in the given code snippet.

3. **Understanding `a` and `b`**:
   - `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
   - `b` is also the result of `func_1(d)`.
   - Since `a` and `b` are both results of the same function `func_1` applied to `d`, they are likely to be the same node or have some specific relationship based on the function `func_1`.

4. **Understanding `path_ba`**:
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the nodes from `b` back to `a` in reverse order.
   - If `a` is unreachable from `b`, `path_ba` ends with `-1`.

5. **Understanding `ops`**:
   - The list `ops` is constructed based on the length of `path_ba`:
     - If the length of `path_ba` is odd and at least 1, `ops` contains tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`, where `c` is the node at the middle index `ci` of `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci`.
     - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., `(c1, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 1)`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

6. **Determining the Length of `ops`**:
   - **Odd Length of `path_ba`**:
     - If `path_ba` has an odd length, the middle index `ci` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{len}(path_ba) - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\).
     - The number of tuples in `ops` will be `ci + 1`, which is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{len}(path_ba) - 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
   - **Even Length of `path_ba`**:
     - If `path_ba` has an even length, `c2` is \(\frac{\text{len}(path_ba)}{2}\) and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
     - The number of tuples in `ops` will be \(\frac{\text{len}(path_ba)}{2}\).

### Conclusion:
- The length of `ops` depends on the length of `path_ba`.
- If `path_ba` has an odd length, the length of `ops` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{len}(path_ba) - 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
- If `path_ba` has an even length, the length of `ops` is \(\frac{\text{len}(path_ba)}{2}\).

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the length of `path_ba`.

Output: **len(ops) (where len(ops) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{len}(path_ba) - 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\) if the length of `path_ba` is odd, and \(\frac{\text{len}(path_ba)}{2}\) if the length of `path_ba` is even)**
