Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` (after `v` is decreased by 1) now contains the value `u` (after `u` is decreased by 1) appended to it, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` (after `u` is decreased by 1) to the list at index `v` (after `v` is decreased by 1) in the list `u2vs`. The values of `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, but the list at index `v` in `u2vs` now includes `u` as an additional element.
