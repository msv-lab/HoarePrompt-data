#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a non-empty list of integers.
def func_1(l):
    return max(range(len(l)), key=lambda x: l[x])
    #The program returns the index of the largest integer in the list `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of integers `l` and returns the index of the largest integer in the list. After the function concludes, the list `l` remains unchanged, and the user receives the index of the largest integer in the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree. The following `n - 1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n + i - 1`, and `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of the integer divisions of `n + i` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` reads the number of vertices and edges of a tree from standard input. It then constructs a path from a node `b` back to a node `a` using a previously computed `previous` array. The function generates a series of operations based on the length of this path. If the path length is odd, it creates operations centered around the middle node of the path. If the path length is even, it creates operations involving the two middle nodes. Finally, the function prints the number of operations and the operations themselves, formatted as pairs of node indices. The function does not return any value.
