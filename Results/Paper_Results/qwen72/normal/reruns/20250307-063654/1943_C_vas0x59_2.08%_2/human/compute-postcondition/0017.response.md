Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v` appended to it, and the list at index `v` now contains the value `u` appended to it. `n` is greater than 1, `u` is the first integer input minus 2, `v` is the second integer input minus 2, `_` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. Initially, `v` was the second integer input minus 1, so after the decrement, `v` is now the second integer input minus 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
