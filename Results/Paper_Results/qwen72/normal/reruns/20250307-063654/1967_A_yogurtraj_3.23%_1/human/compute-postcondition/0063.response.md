Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.**

The code snippet `rem = k % (i + 1)` calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. Given that `k` is 0 and `i` is 1, the expression `k % (i + 1)` evaluates to `0 % (1 + 1)`, which is `0 % 2`, resulting in `0`. Therefore, `rem` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
