Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the third element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to be the third element of the list `a` (since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2, and `a[2]` is the third element). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
