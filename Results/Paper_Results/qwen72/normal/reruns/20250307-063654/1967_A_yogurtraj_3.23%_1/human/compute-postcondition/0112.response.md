Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input, `rem` is 0, `ii` is 1. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`, `r` is `a[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`, `y` is either `n - 1` or 0, and `r` is now equal to `a[2]`.**
