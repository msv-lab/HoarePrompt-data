Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the second element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `a` remains the same sorted list of integers provided by the input.
- `r` remains the second element of `a`.
- `rem` remains 0.
- `y` remains 0.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
