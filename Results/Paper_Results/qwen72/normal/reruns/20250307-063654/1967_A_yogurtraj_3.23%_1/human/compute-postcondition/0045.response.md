Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the last element of `a` or the element calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was met, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` when the condition was met, and `y` is `n - 1 - i` where the condition was met or 0 if it never was.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `a` to a list of integers provided by the input.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain as provided by the input.
- The value of `i` is still `n - 2`.
- The value of `k` is still 0.
- The value of `r` is still determined based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`.
- The value of `rem` is still the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` when the condition was met.
- The value of `y` is still `n - 1 - i` where the condition was met or 0 if it never was.
