Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)` is executed.
- `i` is 2, so `a[i]` is `a[2]`.
- `(i + 1)` is 3.
- `r` is assigned the value of `a[2] + k // 3`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged.
