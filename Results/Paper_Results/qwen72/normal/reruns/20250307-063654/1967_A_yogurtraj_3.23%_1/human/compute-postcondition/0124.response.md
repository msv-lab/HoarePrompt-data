The value of `r` is updated to the sum of the last element of the sorted list `a` (which is `a[n - 1]`) and the integer division of `k` by `n`. Given that `k` is 0, `k // n` will also be 0. Therefore, `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + 0`, which is simply `a[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[n - 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**
