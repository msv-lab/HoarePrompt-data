The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the second element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.**
