Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n - 2`
2. `k` is 0
3. `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input
4. `r` is `a[n - 1] + 0 // n`
5. `rem` is 0
6. `y` is 0

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `r`:**
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + 0 // n`.
   - The expression `0 // n` is integer division, which results in 0 for any positive integer `n`.
   - Therefore, `r` simplifies to `a[n - 1] + 0`, which is just `a[n - 1]`.

2. **Substitute the value of `r` into the print statement:**
   - The print statement is `print((r - 1) * n + 1)`.
   - Substitute `r` with `a[n - 1]`: `print((a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1)`.

3. **Simplify the expression:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1`.
   - This can be broken down as:
     - `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
     - `a[n - 1] - 1` is the last element of the list minus 1.
     - `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n` is the result of multiplying the last element minus 1 by `n`.
     - Adding 1 to the result: `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the value of the expression `(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1`, where `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.

Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list a)**
