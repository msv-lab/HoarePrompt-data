The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range of the loop is from 0 to `n - 1`, and it needs at least one iteration to run.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, and both must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `r` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 0 (which is the starting point of the loop).

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0**
