The code snippet `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from it. Given the initial state, we can determine the following:

- `i` is 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `r` is the second element of `a`, which means `a[1]` is `r`.
- `a[i + 1]` is the third element of `a`, which is `a[2]`.
- The expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` becomes `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.

Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the second element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.**
