Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is `k - (a[1] - a[0])`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0. Additionally, `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to the original value of `k`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.
- Since `i` is 0, the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` simplifies to `1 * (a[1] - a[0])`, which is `a[1] - a[0]`.
- Therefore, `k` is now `k - (a[1] - a[0])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
