Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0. Additionally, the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k` holds true, meaning that the difference between the first and second elements of `a` is greater than 0.**
