Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0. Additionally, the condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) > k` holds true.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `k` is 0.
- The initial value of `i` is 0.
- The expression `rem = k % (i + 1)` simplifies to `rem = 0 % (0 + 1)`, which results in `rem` being 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
