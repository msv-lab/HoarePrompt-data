Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input, `rem` is 0, `ii` is 1, `k` is updated to `k - (3) * (a[3] - a[2])`, `y` is either `n - 1` or 0, `r` is now equal to `a[2]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 2.
- The value of `n` must be greater than 3.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input.
- `rem` is 0.
- `ii` is 1.
- `k` was previously updated to `k - (1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`, and now it is further updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `k - (3) * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- `y` is either `n - 1` or 0.
- `r` is now equal to `a[2]`.
