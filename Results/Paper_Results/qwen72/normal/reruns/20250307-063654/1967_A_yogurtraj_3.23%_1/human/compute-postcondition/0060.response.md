Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `y` is set to `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (a[1] - a[0])`, `r` is set to the second element of `a`, and `y` remains 0.***
