Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1`.**

The code snippet `k = 0` sets the variable `k` to 0, which is the same as its initial value. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
