Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input, `rem` is 0, `ii` is 1, `r` is now equal to `a[2]`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `rem` is `k % 3`, `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 3`, and `r` is updated to `a[2] + (0 - (1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])) // 3`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (3) * (a[3] - a[2])`, and `r` is updated to `a[3]`.***
