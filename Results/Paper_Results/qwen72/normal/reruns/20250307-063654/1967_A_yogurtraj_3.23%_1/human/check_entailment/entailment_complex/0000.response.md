### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the list `a` of integers.
   - The list `a` is sorted, which is a necessary step for the algorithm to work correctly.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The variable `r` is initialized to the smallest element in the sorted list `a[0]`.
   - `rem` and `y` are initialized to 0.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list `a` from the first element to the second-to-last element.
   - For each element, it checks if the cost to make all elements up to `a[i + 1]` equal is greater than the remaining coins `k`.
   - If the cost is greater, it calculates the maximum number of cards that can be bought to make the subarray a permutation and updates `r`, `rem`, and `y` accordingly.
   - If the cost is not greater, it subtracts the cost from `k` and updates `r` to `a[i + 1]`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - If `k` is not zero after the loop, it means we can still buy more cards. The function calculates the final `r` and prints the result.
   - If `k` is zero, it prints the result based on the last calculated `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum score for each test case, which is the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm aims to maximize the number of subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- By sorting the list `a`, the algorithm ensures that it can efficiently determine the minimum number of cards needed to make the subarray a permutation.
- The loop checks the cost to make all elements up to `a[i + 1]` equal and updates the variables accordingly.
- The final calculation ensures that the maximum possible score is printed for each test case.

### Verification:
- The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the function.
- The logic of the function aligns with the problem description and constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and the steps taken are sound and handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
