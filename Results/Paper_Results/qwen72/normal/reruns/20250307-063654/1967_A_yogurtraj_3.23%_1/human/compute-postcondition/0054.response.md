Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 0, `y` becomes `n - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
