Output State: **`ii` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last `n` value provided by the input, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a` or the element calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was met, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` when the condition was met, and `y` is `n - 1 - i` where the condition was met or 0 if it never was. If `k` was not 0, `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- `ii` will be `t - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t - 1`, and after all iterations, `ii` will have reached its final value.
- `n` will be the last `n` value provided by the input for the final test case.
- `k` will be `0` because the loop either sets `k` to `0` when it finds a condition where `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` or reduces `k` to `0` by the end of the loop.
- `a` will be a sorted list of integers provided by the input for the final test case.
- `r` will be the last element of the sorted list `a` or the element calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was met.
- `rem` will be the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` when the condition was met, or `0` if the condition was never met.
- `y` will be `n - 1 - i` where the condition was met, or `0` if the condition was never met.
- If `k` was not `0` by the end of the inner loop, `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
