The code snippet `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from it. Given the initial state, let's break down the impact:

- `n` must be greater than 2 (unchanged).
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input (unchanged).
- `rem` is 0 (unchanged).
- `y` is 0 (unchanged).

The code updates `k`:
- `i + 1` is `3`.
- `a[i + 1]` is `a[3]`.
- `a[i]` is `a[2]`.

Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.

The value of `r` is set to the third element of `a`, which is `a[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, `r` is `a[2]`.**
