Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the first element of `a` plus `k` (since `i` is 0, `k // (i + 1)` is `k`), `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is greater than `k` divided by `i + 1`.**
