Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the last element of `a` or the element calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was met, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` when the condition was met, and `y` is `n - 1 - i` where the condition was met or 0 if it never was. Additionally, `k` is 0.**
