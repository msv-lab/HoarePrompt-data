Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the first element of `a` plus `k`, `rem` is `k % 1` (which is 0), `y` is 0, and the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is greater than `k` divided by `i + 1`.**
