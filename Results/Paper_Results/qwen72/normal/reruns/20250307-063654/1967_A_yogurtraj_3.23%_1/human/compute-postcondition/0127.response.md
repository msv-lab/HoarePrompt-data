Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `k` is 0
   - `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`
   - `rem` is 0
   - `y` is 0
   - `k` is equal to 0 (repeated, but still 0)

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`. This means `r` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the calculation. We need to assume `n` is a known integer.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is: `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `rem` is 0
     - `y` is 0
   - The expression simplifies to: `(r - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0` which is `(r - 1) * n + 1`

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`, where `r` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a` and `n` is a known integer.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the maximum value in the sorted list `a` and n is a known integer)**
