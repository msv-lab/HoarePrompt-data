Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is the first element of `a` divided by 2, and `y` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is the third element of `a`, and `y` remains 0.***
