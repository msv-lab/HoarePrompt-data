The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `ii` is initialized by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust it. The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
