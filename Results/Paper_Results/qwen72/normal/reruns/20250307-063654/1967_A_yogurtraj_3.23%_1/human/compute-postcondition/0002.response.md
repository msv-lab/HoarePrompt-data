The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list `a`. The variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, and both must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
