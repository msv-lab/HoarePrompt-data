Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rem` is updated to `k % 3` because `i` is 2, and `i + 1` is 3.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `y`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
