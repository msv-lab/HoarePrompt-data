Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is greater than `k` divided by `i + 1`, then `k` is set to 0 and `y` is set to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (a[1] - a[0])` and `r` is set to the second element of `a`.***
