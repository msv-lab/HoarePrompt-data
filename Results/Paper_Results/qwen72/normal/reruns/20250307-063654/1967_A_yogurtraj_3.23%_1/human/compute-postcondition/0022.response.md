Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the first element of `a` plus `k` divided by 2 (which is now the first element of `a` plus 0 divided by 2, so `r` is the first element of `a` divided by 2), `rem` is `k % 2` (which is now 0 % 2, so `rem` is 0), and `y` is `n - 2`.**
