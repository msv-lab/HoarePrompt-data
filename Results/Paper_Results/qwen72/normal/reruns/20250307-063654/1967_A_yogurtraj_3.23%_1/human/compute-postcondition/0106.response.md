Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input, `rem` is `k % 2`, `ii` is 1, `k` is either 0 or updated to `k - (0 + 1) * (a[1] - a[0])`, `y` is either `n - 1` or 0, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`**

Explanation:
- `rem` is assigned the value of `k % (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 1, `rem` becomes `k % 2`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `ii`, `k`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state.
