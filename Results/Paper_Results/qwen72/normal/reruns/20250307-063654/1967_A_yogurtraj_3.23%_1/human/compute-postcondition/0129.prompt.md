Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the last element of `a` or the element calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was met, `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` when the condition was met, and `y` is `n - 1 - i` where the condition was met or 0 if it never was. If `k` was not 0, `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0. If `k` is not 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + 0 // n`. Otherwise, `r` is the last element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 2`, `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `k` remains 0 regardless of the condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
