Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `k` is 0
   - `r` is `a[n - 1]`
   - `rem` is 0
   - `y` is 0

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print((r - 1) * n + 1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1]`, which means `r` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` involves the following steps:
     - Subtract 1 from `r` to get `r - 1`.
     - Multiply the result by `n` to get `(r - 1) * n`.
     - Add 1 to the result to get `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The value printed will be the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`, where `r` is the last element of the list `a` and `n` is the length of the list `a`.

Output: **(a[n - 1] - 1) * n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the list `a` and `n` is the length of the list `a`)**
