Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `k` is 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `r` is the last element of `a` or the element calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was met.
- `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` when the condition was met.
- `y` is `n - 1 - i` where the condition was met or 0 if it never was.
- Additionally, `k` is 0.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is `n - 2` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be a non-negative integer.
   - For example, if `n = 5`, then `i = 3`.

2. **Value of `k`**:
   - `k` is explicitly given as 0.

3. **Value of `r`**:
   - `r` is either the last element of `a` or the element calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` where the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was met.
   - Since `k` is 0, the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > 0` simplifies to `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > 0`.
   - This condition will always be true because `i + 1` is a positive integer and `a[i + 1] - a[i]` is non-negative (since `a` is sorted).
   - Therefore, `r` will be calculated as `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1) = a[i]`.

4. **Value of `rem`**:
   - `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`.
   - Since `k` is 0, `rem` will be `0 % (i + 1) = 0`.

5. **Value of `y`**:
   - `y` is `n - 1 - i` where the condition was met or 0 if it never was.
   - Since the condition is always met, `y` will be `n - 1 - i`.
   - For example, if `n = 5` and `i = 3`, then `y = 5 - 1 - 3 = 1`.

### Print Statement:
```
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

### Calculation:
- `r` is `a[i]`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is `n - 1 - i`.

Substituting these values into the print statement:
- `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` becomes `(a[i] - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + (n - 1 - i)`.
- Simplifying further: `(a[i] - 1) * n + 1 + (n - 1 - i)`.

Let's break it down:
- `(a[i] - 1) * n` is the product of `a[i] - 1` and `n`.
- `1` is added.
- `n - 1 - i` is added.

So the final expression is:
- `(a[i] - 1) * n + 1 + (n - 1 - i)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **(a[i] - 1) * n + 1 + (n - 1 - i) (where `a[i]` is the element at index `i` of the sorted list `a`, `n` is the value of `n`, and `i` is `n - 2`)**.
