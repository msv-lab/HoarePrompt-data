Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the last element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0, and the current value of `k` is not 0.**

However, there is a contradiction in the postcondition because the precondition states that `k` is 0, but the if condition requires `k` to be not 0. Therefore, the if condition cannot be true given the precondition. 

To resolve this, the correct postcondition should reflect that the if condition is not met:

Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the last element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0, and the current value of `k` is 0.**
