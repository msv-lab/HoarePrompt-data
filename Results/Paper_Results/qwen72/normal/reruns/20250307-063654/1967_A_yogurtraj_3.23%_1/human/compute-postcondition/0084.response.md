Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `k` is 0
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input
   - `r` is the last element of `a`
   - `rem` is 0
   - `y` is 0

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
   ```

3. **Variable Analysis:**
   - `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is sorted, `r` is the maximum value in the list.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.

4. **Expression Calculation:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is: `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `rem` is 0
     - `y` is 0
     - The expression simplifies to: `(r - 1) * n + 1`

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`.
   - Since `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a` and `n` is the length of the list `a`, the output will be: `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last element of the sorted list `a` and n is the length of the list `a`)**
