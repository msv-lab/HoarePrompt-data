Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is the first element of `a` and `y` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])` and `r` is the third element of `a`.***
