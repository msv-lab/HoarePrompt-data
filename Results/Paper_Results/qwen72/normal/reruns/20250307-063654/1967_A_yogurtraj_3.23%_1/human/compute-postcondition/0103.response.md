Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input, `rem` is 0, `ii` is 1. If the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is greater than `k`, then `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 1`, and `r` is `a[0]`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (0 + 1) * (a[1] - a[0])`, `y` is 0, and `r` is the second element of `a`.***
