Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the first element of `a` plus `k`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1`, and the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is greater than `k` divided by `i + 1`.**

The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1`, and all other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
