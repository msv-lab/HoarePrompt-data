Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
