The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `0` and `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, because the range `0, n - 1` must contain at least one value (which is 0 when `n` is 2). The variable `i` is initialized to `n - 2` before the loop, but for the loop to start, `i` should be 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0**
