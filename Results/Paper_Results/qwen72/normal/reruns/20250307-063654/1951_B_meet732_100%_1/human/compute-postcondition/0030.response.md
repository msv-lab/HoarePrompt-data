Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, and the ratings are pairwise distinct; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, if such elements exist; `c` is 2 if there are at least two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `x` and the loop breaks if `c` reaches 2; `i` is the index of the last element checked in `a` (which could be less than `n-1` if the loop breaks early); `n` remains unchanged; `ind` is not an empty list and contains exactly one index; `ind[0]` is not equal to 0.**
