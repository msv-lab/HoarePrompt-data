Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, and the ratings are pairwise distinct; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the integer `i` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains an empty list; `c` is 2, indicating that there are exactly two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`; `i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
