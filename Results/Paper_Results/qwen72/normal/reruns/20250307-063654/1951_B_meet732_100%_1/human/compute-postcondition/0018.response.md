Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, and the ratings are pairwise distinct; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the integers `1` and `2` if `a[1]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` contains the integer `2`; `c` is 2 if `a[1]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `c` remains 1; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2. If `c` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
