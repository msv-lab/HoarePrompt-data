Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, and the ratings are pairwise distinct; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, if such elements exist, and `ind` contains exactly one index, which is 0; `c` is 1, indicating that only one element in `a` has been found to be greater than `x` so far; `i` is the index of the last element checked in `a` (which could be less than `n-1` if the loop breaks early); `n` remains unchanged.**
