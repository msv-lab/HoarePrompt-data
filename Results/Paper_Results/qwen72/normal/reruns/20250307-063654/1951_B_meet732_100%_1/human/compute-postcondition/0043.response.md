The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, and all ratings in the list are pairwise distinct. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- **Case_2**: The function returns `k - 1`, where `k` is the index of the integer `x` in the list `a`.
- **Case_3**: The function returns the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, minus 1.
- **Case_4**: The function returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `k` is the index of the integer `x` in the list `a`, and `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`.
- **Case_5**: The function returns the minimum value between the index of the second element in `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1.
- **Case_6**: The function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` and `ind[1]` are the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
- **Case_7**: The function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x`, and `k` is the index of `x` in the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of distinct integers representing Cowdeforces ratings. It returns one of several values based on the position of a specific integer `x` in the list and the positions of elements greater than `x`. The possible return values are: `n - 1` (length of the list minus one), `k - 1` (index of `x` minus one), the index of the first element greater than `x` minus one, the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, the minimum of the index of the second element greater than `x` minus one and `k - 1`, the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, or the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.**
