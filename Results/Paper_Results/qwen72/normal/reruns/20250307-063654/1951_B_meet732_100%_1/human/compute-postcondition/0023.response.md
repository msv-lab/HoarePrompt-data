Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, and the ratings are pairwise distinct; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, if such elements exist; `c` is 2 if there are at least two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `x` and the loop breaks if `c` reaches 2; `i` is the index of the last element checked in `a` (which could be less than `n-1` if the loop breaks early); `n` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `a` and the value `x` (which is the rating at index `k` in `a`) remain unchanged.
- The list `ind` will contain the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, if such elements exist.
- The variable `c` will be 2 if there are at least two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`. If there are fewer than two such elements, `c` will be the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
- The variable `i` will be the index of the last element checked in `a`. If the loop breaks early because `c` reaches 2, `i` will be the index of the second element greater than `x`. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be `n-1`.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged and represents the length of the list `a`.
