Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k`. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal swap position for the cow `k` to maximize the number of wins. Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 2
10 5 15 20 25
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The cow at position `k = 2` has a rating of `5`.
- The optimal strategy is to swap the cow at position `2` with the cow at position `3` (rating `15`), so the new order is:
  - `[10, 15, 5, 20, 25]`
- The matches would proceed as follows:
  - Match 1: Cow with rating `10` vs. Cow with rating `15` → Cow with rating `15` wins.
  - Match 2: Cow with rating `15` vs. Cow with rating `5` → Cow with rating `15` wins.
  - Match 3: Cow with rating `15` vs. Cow with rating `20` → Cow with rating `20` wins.
  - Match 4: Cow with rating `20` vs. Cow with rating `25` → Cow with rating `25` wins.
- The cow with rating `5` wins 2 matches (against the cow with rating `10` and the cow with rating `15`).

However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` because it does not correctly handle the logic for finding the optimal swap position. The function `func_1` does not properly account for the scenario where the cow at position `k` can be swapped to a position that allows it to win more matches.
