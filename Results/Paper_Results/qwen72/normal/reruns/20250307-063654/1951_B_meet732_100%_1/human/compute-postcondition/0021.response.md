Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, and the ratings are pairwise distinct; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is a list containing the integer `2` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains a list containing the integer `1` if `a[1]` is greater than `x` or an empty list otherwise; `c` is 3 if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `c` remains 2; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
