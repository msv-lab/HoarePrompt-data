Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, and the ratings are pairwise distinct; `x` is equal to the integer at index `k` in the list `a`; `ind` is an empty list, indicating that there are no elements in `a` that are greater than `x`; `c` is 0, as no elements in `a` are greater than `x`; `i` is the index of the last element checked in `a`, which could be less than `n-1` if the loop breaks early; `n` remains unchanged.**
