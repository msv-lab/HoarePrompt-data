Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
2. `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).
3. `x` is a list of \(n-1\) integers where \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\).
4. `line` is a string input.
5. `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer.
6. `a` is a list containing the integers:
   - \(1000\)
   - \(1000 + T[0]\)
   - \(1000 + T[0] + T[1]\)
   - ...
   - \(1000 + T[0] + T[1] + \ldots + T[n-2]\)
7. `i` is \(n-1\).
8. `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input `t` and `n`**:
   - `t` is an integer within the range \(0 < t \leq 10^4 - 2\).
   - `n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).

2. **List `x`**:
   - `x` is a list of \(n-1\) integers, each within the range \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\).

3. **String `line`**:
   - `line` is a string input, which is split into a list of integers `T`.

4. **List `T`**:
   - `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer. The length of `T` is \(n-1\) because `x` has \(n-1\) elements.

5. **List `a`**:
   - `a` is constructed by starting with 1000 and then adding the cumulative sum of elements from `T`.
   - The first element of `a` is \(1000\).
   - The second element of `a` is \(1000 + T[0]\).
   - The third element of `a` is \(1000 + T[0] + T[1]\).
   - This continues until the last element of `a` which is \(1000 + T[0] + T[1] + \ldots + T[n-2]\).

6. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is set to \(n-1\), which is the length of `T`.

7. **Variable `result`**:
   - `result` is a string that contains all the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. Each element in `a` is calculated as follows:
- The first element is \(1000\).
- The second element is \(1000 + T[0]\).
- The third element is \(1000 + T[0] + T[1]\).
- ...
- The last element is \(1000 + T[0] + T[1] + \ldots + T[n-2]\).

Since the exact values of `T` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `a`. However, we can describe the structure of the output.

Output: **1000 1000 + T[0] 1000 + T[0] + T[1] ... 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]** (where each element is the cumulative sum starting from 1000 and adding the elements of `T` up to the corresponding index).
