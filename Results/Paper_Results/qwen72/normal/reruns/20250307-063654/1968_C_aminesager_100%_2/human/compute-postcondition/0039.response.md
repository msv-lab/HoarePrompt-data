The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables are used in the loop condition.

1. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. In the loop, `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
2. **Variable `n`**: The condition for the loop to execute is that `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that -1 < t <= 10^4 - 3
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500
- `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500
- `line` is a string input provided by the user
- `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer
- `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0]
- `i` is 1
- `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces

After adjusting the state for the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that -1 < t <= 10^4 - 3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 2, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces, `n` must be greater than 2**
