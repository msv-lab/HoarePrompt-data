Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to the list `a`.
- `i` is 2, so `a[1] + T[1]` is calculated and appended to `a`.
- The initial values of `a` are `[1000, 1000 + T[0]]`.
- Therefore, the new value appended to `a` is `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `T`, and `i` remain unchanged.
