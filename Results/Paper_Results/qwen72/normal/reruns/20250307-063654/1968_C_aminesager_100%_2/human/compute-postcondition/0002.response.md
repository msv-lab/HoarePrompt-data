Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 for each test case, and `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now an integer within the range 0 to 10^4 - 1. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.
