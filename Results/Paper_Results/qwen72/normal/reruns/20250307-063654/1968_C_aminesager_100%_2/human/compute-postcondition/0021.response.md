Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integer 1000, `i` is n-1, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.**

The code snippet `a = [1000]` resets the list `a` to contain only the integer 1000. The other variables remain unchanged.
