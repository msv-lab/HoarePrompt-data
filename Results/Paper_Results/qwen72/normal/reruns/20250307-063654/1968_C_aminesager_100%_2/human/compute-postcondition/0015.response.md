Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).
   - `x` is a list of \(n-1\) integers where \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\).
   - `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer.
   - `a` is a list containing the integers \(1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], \ldots, 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + \ldots + T[n-2]\).
   - `i` is \(n-1\).
   - `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `T` is derived from the string `line`, which is not explicitly provided, but we know it is split and converted to integers.
   - `a` is constructed by starting with 1000 and then adding the cumulative sum of elements from `T` up to the \(n-2\) index.
   - `result` is a string that concatenates the elements of `a` with spaces.

3. **Constructing the List `a`:**
   - The first element of `a` is \(1000\).
   - The second element of `a` is \(1000 + T[0]\).
   - The third element of `a` is \(1000 + T[0] + T[1]\).
   - This pattern continues until the last element, which is \(1000 + T[0] + T[1] + \ldots + T[n-2]\).

4. **Constructing the String `result`:**
   - `result` is formed by converting each element of `a` to a string and joining them with spaces.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will output the string `result`, which contains the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

Since the exact values of `T` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `T` and the construction of `a`.

Output: **1000 1000 + T[0] 1000 + T[0] + T[1] ... 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2] (where T is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the string `line`)**
