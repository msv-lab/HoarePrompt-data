Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration until `t` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates. The variables `n`, `x`, `line`, `T`, `a`, `i`, and `result` will have the same properties as described in the output state after the first 3 iterations, but these values will correspond to the final iteration of the loop. Specifically, `n` will be the last input integer provided, `x` will be a list of `n-1` integers, `line` will be the last string input provided by the user, `T` will be the list of integers derived from `line`, `a` will be the cumulative sum list starting from 1000, and `result` will be the string representation of the elements in `a` separated by spaces. The variable `i` will be `n-1` after the final iteration of the inner loop.
