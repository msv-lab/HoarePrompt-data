The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 2, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.**
