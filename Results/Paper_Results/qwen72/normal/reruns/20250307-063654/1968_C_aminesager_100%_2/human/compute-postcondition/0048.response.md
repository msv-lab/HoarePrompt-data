Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a space-separated list of `n-1` integers. It then calculates a new list `a` where each element is the cumulative sum of the input list elements starting from 1000. Finally, it prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and the program state includes the printed results for each test case. **
