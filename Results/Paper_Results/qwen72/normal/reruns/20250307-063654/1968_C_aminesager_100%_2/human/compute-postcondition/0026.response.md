The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `i` is 3, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces, `n` must be greater than 3**
