Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4 - 2.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
- The list `x` remains a list of n-1 integers where each element is between 1 and 500.
- The string `line` remains the same input string.
- The list `T` remains the list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer.
- The list `a` now contains `n` elements, starting with 1000 and each subsequent element being the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`.
- The variable `result` is a string containing all the elements in the list `a` separated by spaces.
