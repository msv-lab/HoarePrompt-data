The code snippet `line = input('')` reads a line of input and assigns it to the variable `line`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. The new variable `line` is a string containing the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 for each test case, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string containing the input.**
