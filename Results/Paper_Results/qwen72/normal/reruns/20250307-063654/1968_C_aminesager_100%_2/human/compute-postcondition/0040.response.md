Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that -1 < t <= 10^4 - 3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `i` is 2, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces, `n` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends the value `a[1] + T[1]` to the list `a`.
- `a[1]` is `1000 + T[0]`.
- `T[1]` is the second integer in the list `T`.
- Therefore, the new element in `a` is `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`.
- The list `a` now contains the integers `1000`, `1000 + T[0]`, and `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `line`, `T`, `i`, and `result` remain unchanged.
