Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list containing the integer 1000.
- The code snippet `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0.
- The new element appended to `a` is `a[0] + T[0]`, which is `1000 + T[0]`.
- Therefore, `a` now contains the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0].
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `T` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
