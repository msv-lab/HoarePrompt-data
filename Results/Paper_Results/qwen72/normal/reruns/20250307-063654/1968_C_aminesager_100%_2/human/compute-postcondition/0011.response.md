The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since the loop is set to iterate from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive), the next value of `i` will be 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
