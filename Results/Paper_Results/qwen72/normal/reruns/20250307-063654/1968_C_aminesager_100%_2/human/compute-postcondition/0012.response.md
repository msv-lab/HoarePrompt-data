Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3.**

The code appends the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`, which is `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`. `T[i - 1]` is `T[2]`. Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2]`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
