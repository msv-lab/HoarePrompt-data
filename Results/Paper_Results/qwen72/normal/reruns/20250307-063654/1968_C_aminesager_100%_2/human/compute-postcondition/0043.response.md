Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that -1 < t <= 10^4 - 3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.**

Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` will contain `n` integers. The first integer in `a` is 1000, and each subsequent integer is the sum of the previous integer in `a` and the corresponding integer from the list `T`. The variable `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a` that was updated in the loop. The variable `result` will be a string where each element of the list `a` is separated by spaces. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `line`, and `T` remain unchanged from their initial states.
