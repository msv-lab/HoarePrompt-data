The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 1, as the loop will start with `i` being 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integer 1000, `i` is 1**
