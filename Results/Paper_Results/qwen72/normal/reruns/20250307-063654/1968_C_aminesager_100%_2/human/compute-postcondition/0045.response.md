Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that -1 < t <= 10^4 - 3.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
   - `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500.
   - `line` is a string input provided by the user.
   - `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer.
   - `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2].
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `T` is derived from the string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer.
   - `a` is constructed by starting with 1000 and then adding the cumulative sum of elements from `T` to it.
   - `result` is a string that contains all elements of `a` separated by spaces.

3. **Constructing the List `a`**:
   - The first element of `a` is 1000.
   - The second element of `a` is 1000 + T[0].
   - The third element of `a` is 1000 + T[0] + T[1].
   - This pattern continues until the last element, which is 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2].

4. **Constructing the String `result`**:
   - `result` is created by joining all elements of `a` with spaces.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will output the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the construction of `a`, the output will be a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces. Since the exact values of `T` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `T`.

Output: **1000 1000 + T[0] 1000 + T[0] + T[1] ... 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2] (where T is the list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer)**
