You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a space-separated list of `n-1` integers. It then calculates a new list `a` where each element is the cumulative sum of the input list elements starting from 1000. Finally, it prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, and the program state includes the printed results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the initial value of `a[0]` is set to 1000, which may not always satisfy the condition \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) and \(x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```
The program will output:
```
1000 1002 1006 1007
```
However, this output does not satisfy the condition \(x_2 = a_2 \mod a_1\):
- \(a_2 \mod a_1 = 1002 \mod 1000 = 2\), which is correct.
- \(a_3 \mod a_2 = 1006 \mod 1002 = 4\), which is correct.
- \(a_4 \mod a_3 = 1007 \mod 1006 = 1\), which is correct.

But, if we consider a different input:
```
1
3
1 1
```
The program will output:
```
1000 1001 1002
```
However, this output does not satisfy the condition \(x_2 = a_2 \mod a_1\):
- \(a_2 \mod a_1 = 1001 \mod 1000 = 1\), which is correct.
- \(a_3 \mod a_2 = 1002 \mod 1001 = 1\), which is correct.

But, if we consider a different input:
```
1
2
500
```
The program will output:
```
1000 1500
```
However, this output does not satisfy the condition \(x_2 = a_2 \mod a_1\):
- \(a_2 \mod a_1 = 1500 \mod 1000 = 500\), which is correct.

The issue arises because the initial value of 1000 is not always a valid choice for \(a_1\). A better approach would be to set \(a_1\) to a value that ensures the conditions are met for all subsequent elements. For example, setting \(a_1\) to \(x_2 + 1\) would be a more robust solution.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [T[0] + 1]  # Initialize a_1 to be x_2 + 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that \(a_1\) is always a valid value that satisfies the conditions for all subsequent elements.
