Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` updates the variable `T` to be a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer.
- The initial state specifies that `T` is already a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, so this code does not change the value of `T`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `result`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and properties.
