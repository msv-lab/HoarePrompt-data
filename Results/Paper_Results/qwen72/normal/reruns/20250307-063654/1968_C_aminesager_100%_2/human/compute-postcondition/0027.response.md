Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and `n` must be greater than 3, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], `i` is 3, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is the sum of the last element in `a` (which is `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`) and the element `T[2]`.
- The updated list `a` now contains the integers: 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2].
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `line`, `T`, `i`, and `result` remain unchanged.
