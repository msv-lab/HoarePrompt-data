Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that -1 < t <= 10^4 - 3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts each element in the list `a` to a string and joins them with spaces.
- The list `a` contains the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2].
- The variable `result` now holds a string where each element of `a` is separated by a space.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `line`, `T`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
