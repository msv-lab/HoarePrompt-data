Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that -1 < t <= 10^4 - 3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new range for `t` is -1 < t <= 10^4 - 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
