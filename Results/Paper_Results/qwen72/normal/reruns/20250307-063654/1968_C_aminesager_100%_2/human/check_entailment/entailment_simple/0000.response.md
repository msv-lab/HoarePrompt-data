### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a`**:
   - The program initializes the array `a` with a single element `1000`. This is a valid choice for `a_1` since it ensures that `a_1` is greater than any possible `x_i` (as `1 \le x_i \le 500`).

2. **Loop to Construct `a`**:
   - The program then iterates from `i = 1` to `n-1` (inclusive). For each `i`, it appends `a[i-1] + T[i-1]` to the array `a`.
   - This construction ensures that `a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = T[i-1]` because `a_i` is exactly `a_{i-1} + T[i-1]`, and the remainder when `a_i` is divided by `a_{i-1}` is `T[i-1]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program then converts the list `a` to a string with elements separated by spaces and prints it.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly:
     - `t` is the number of test cases, and it is decremented until it reaches 0.
     - `n` is the number of elements in the array `a`, and it is within the range `2 \le n \le 500`.
     - `T` is a list of `n-1` integers, each within the range `1 \le x_i \le 500`.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with `n = 4` and `T = [2, 4, 1]`:
     - `a = [1000, 1002, 1006, 1007]`
     - `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1002 \bmod 1000 = 2 = x_2`
     - `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1006 \bmod 1002 = 4 = x_3`
     - `a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1007 \bmod 1006 = 1 = x_4`
   - This matches the problem description and the example output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array `a` such that `a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 \le i \le n`. It handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
