Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4 - 2, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 1, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends the value of `a[0] + T[0]` to the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` contains the integer 1000.
- `i` is 1, so `i - 1` is 0.
- Therefore, `a[0] + T[0]` is `1000 + T[0]`.
- The new value `1000 + T[0]` is appended to `a`, making `a` a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0].
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `line`, and `T` are not affected.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `result` remains a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces, which is now "1000 1000 + T[0]".
