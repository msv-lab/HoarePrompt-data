Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that -1 < t <= 10^4 - 3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 <= x_i <= 500, `line` is a string input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 1, `result` is a string of the elements in `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends the value `a[0] + T[0]` to the list `a`.
- Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0, so `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`, which is 1000.
- `T[i - 1]` is `T[0]`, which is the first integer in the list `T`.
- Therefore, the new value appended to `a` is `1000 + T[0]`.
- The list `a` now contains the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0].
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `line`, `T`, `i`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
