Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer - 2, `k` is an input integer - 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is equal to the value of `a[f]` after sorting, `n`, `f`, and `k` are updated with new values from the input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to be the value of `a[f]` after the list `a` is sorted.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain as they were in the initial state, but `n`, `f`, and `k` are updated with new values from the input.
- The precondition that `1 <= t <= 1000` and that `n`, `f`, and `k` are updated with new values from the input remains valid.
