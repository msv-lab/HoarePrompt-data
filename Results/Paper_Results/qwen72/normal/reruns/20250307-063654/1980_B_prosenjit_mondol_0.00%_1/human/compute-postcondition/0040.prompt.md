Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer equal to `t`, `f` is an integer equal to `f - 1`, `k` is an integer equal to `k - 1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `x` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then the integer at index `k` in the list `a` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, if `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`, then the integer at index `k` in the list `a` is either strictly less than `x` or exactly equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer - 1, `k` is an input integer - 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and is now sorted in descending order, `x` is equal to `a[f]` after sorting. If `a[k]` > `x`, then the condition `a[k] > x` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `a[k]` <= `x` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer - 2, `k` is an input integer - 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is equal to the value of `a[f]` after sorting, and `n`, `f`, and `k` are updated with new values from the input. If `a[k]` > `x`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `a[k]` < `x`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `a[k]` == `x`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
