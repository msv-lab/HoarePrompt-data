Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer equal to `t`, `f` is an integer equal to `f - 1`, `k` is an integer equal to `k - 1`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the integer at index `f - 1` in the sorted list `a`, and the integer at index `k` in the list `a` is less than or equal to `x`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, then `a[k]` is strictly less than `x`. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, then `a[k]` is exactly equal to `x`.***
