Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer equal to `t`, `f` is an integer, `k` is an integer.** 

The input is split into three integers, where the first integer is assigned to `n`, the second to `f`, and the third to `k`. Since the input is a positive integer equal to `t`, `n` now holds the value of `t`. The values of `f` and `k` are determined by the second and third integers in the input, respectively. The initial state of `t` remains valid.
