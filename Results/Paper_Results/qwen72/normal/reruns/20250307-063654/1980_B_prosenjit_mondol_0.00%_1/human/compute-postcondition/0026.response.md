Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer - 1, `k` is an input integer - 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and is now sorted in descending order, `x` is equal to `a[f]` after sorting. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. Otherwise, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.*** 

However, since the if and else parts have the same postconditions, the overall postcondition is:
