Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting, and the favorite cube's index is exactly k. In this case, the program should output "YES" if the favorite cube is removed, but it outputs "MAYBE" instead.

Example input that demonstrates the issue:
```
1
5 3 2
3 3 3 2 1
```
Expected output:
```
YES
```
Actual output from the program:
```
MAYBE
```
In this example, the favorite cube is the third cube with a value of 3. After sorting, the list becomes `[3, 3, 3, 2, 1]`. The first 2 cubes are removed, and the favorite cube is one of them, so the output should be "YES". However, the program outputs "MAYBE" because it checks if `a[k] == x` and then incorrectly determines that the favorite cube might not be removed.
