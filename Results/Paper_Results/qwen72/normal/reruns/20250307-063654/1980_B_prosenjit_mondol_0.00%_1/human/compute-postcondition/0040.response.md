Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100 for each test case, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for each test case. For each iteration, `f` and `k` are decremented by 1, `a` is sorted in descending order, `x` is the integer at index `f` in the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then "NO" is printed. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, then "YES" is printed. If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, then "YES" is printed if `k` is the last index or the integer at index `k - 1` in the sorted list `a` is less than `x`; otherwise, "MAYBE" is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, the variables `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers within the specified range, and the list `a` contains integers within the specified range. During each iteration, `f` and `k` are adjusted by subtracting 1, and the list `a` is sorted in descending order. The value of `x` is set to the element at the adjusted index `f` in the sorted list `a`. The loop then checks the relationship between `a[k]` and `x` and prints "NO" if `a[k]` is greater than `x`, "YES" if `a[k]` is less than `x`, and "MAYBE" if `a[k]` is equal to `x` and the conditions specified in the else part are met. This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.
