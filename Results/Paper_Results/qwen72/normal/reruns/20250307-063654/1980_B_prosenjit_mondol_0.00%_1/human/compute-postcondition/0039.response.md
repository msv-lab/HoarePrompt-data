Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer - 2, `k` is an input integer - 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is equal to the value of `a[f]` after sorting, and `n`, `f`, and `k` are updated with new values from the input. If `a[k]` > `x`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `a[k]` < `x`, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If `a[k]` == `x`, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.***
