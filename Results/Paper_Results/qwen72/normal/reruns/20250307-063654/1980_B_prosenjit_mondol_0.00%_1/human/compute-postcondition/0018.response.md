Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer - 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `x` is the integer at index `f` in the sorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then the integer at index `k` in the list `a` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, if `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`, then the integer at index `k` in the list `a` is either strictly less than `x` or exactly equal to `x`.**
