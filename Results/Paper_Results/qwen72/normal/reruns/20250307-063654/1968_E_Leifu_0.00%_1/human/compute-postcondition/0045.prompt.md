Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print('1 1')
    print('1 2')
    if n == 3:
        print('2 3')
    else:
        print('2 4')
        for j in range(4, n + 1):
            print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 0, and if `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 1. If `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`. If `n` is less than 3, the value of `n` remains unchanged and `j` is not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 2. If `n` == 3, there are no changes to the variables. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n` (which is always true), and `j` is set to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
