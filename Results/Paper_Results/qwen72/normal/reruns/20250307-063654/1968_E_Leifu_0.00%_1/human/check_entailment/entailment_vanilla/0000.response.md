Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem of maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, it reads an integer \(n\) (the size of the grid).
2. **Output**: For each test case, the program should output \(n\) points \((x_i, y_i)\) such that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these points is maximized.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and the size of the grid \(n\) for each test case.

2. **Output for \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - For \(n = 2\), the possible Manhattan distances are \(0\) (distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 1)\)) and \(1\) (distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\)).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).

3. **Output for \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
   - For \(n = 3\), the possible Manhattan distances are:
     - \(0\) (distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 1)\))
     - \(1\) (distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\))
     - \(2\) (distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 3)\))
     - \(1\) (distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((1, 2)\))
     - \(2\) (distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 3)\))
     - \(3\) (distance between \((2, 3)\) and \((2, 3)\))
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

4. **Output for \(n \geq 4\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\), it outputs \((j, j)\).
   - For \(n = 4\), the points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\).
     - The possible Manhattan distances are:
       - \(0\) (distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 1)\))
       - \(1\) (distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\))
       - \(4\) (distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 4)\))
       - \(4\) (distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((4, 4)\))
       - \(1\) (distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((1, 2)\))
       - \(3\) (distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 4)\))
       - \(3\) (distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((4, 4)\))
       - \(2\) (distance between \((2, 4)\) and \((2, 4)\))
       - \(2\) (distance between \((2, 4)\) and \((4, 4)\))
       - \(0\) (distance between \((4, 4)\) and \((4, 4)\))
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 5. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\). The maximum possible size is 6, as shown in the problem notes.

5. **General Case for \(n \geq 4\)**:
   - The program outputs points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).
   - The distances between these points include:
     - Distances between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) (1)
     - Distances between \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 4)\) (4)
     - Distances between \((1, 1)\) and \((j, j)\) (which are \(j-1\))
     - Distances between \((1, 2)\) and \((2, 4)\) (3)
     - Distances between \((1, 2)\) and \((j, j)\) (which are \(j-1\))
     - Distances between \((2, 4)\) and \((j, j)\) (which are \(j-2\))
     - Distances between \((j, j)\) and \((k, k)\) (which are \(|j-k| + |j-k| = 2|j-k|\))
   - The program does not generate all possible distinct distances, especially for larger \(n\). For example, for \(n = 5\), the program outputs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8\}\), which has a size of 7. However, the maximum possible size for \(n = 5\) is 9, as shown in the problem notes.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always generate the maximum possible size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n \geq 4\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
