Reasoning:  
The program attempts to solve the problem by printing a specific set of points for each test case. However, the approach taken by the program does not always maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\). Let's break down the issues:

1. **For \( n = 2 \)**:
   - The program prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - The Manhattan distances are \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\) and \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct for \( n = 2 \).

2. **For \( n = 3 \)**:
   - The program prints the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
     - \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 3\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct for \( n = 3 \).

3. **For \( n \geq 4 \)**:
   - The program prints the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).
   - This approach does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For example, if \( n = 4 \), the points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\).
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
     - \(|1-1| + |1-4| = 3\)
     - \(|1-2| + |1-4| = 4\)
     - \(|1-4| + |1-4| = 6\)
     - \(|2-4| + |4-4| = 2\)
     - \(|1-4| + |2-4| = 5\)
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which is not the maximum possible set for \( n = 4 \). The maximum possible set for \( n = 4 \) should include all distances from 0 to 6, but it should also include 7, which is missing in this set.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be chosen such that the Manhattan distances cover all possible values from 0 to \(2(n-1)\). The program's current approach does not achieve this for \( n \geq 4 \).

Correctness: **False**
