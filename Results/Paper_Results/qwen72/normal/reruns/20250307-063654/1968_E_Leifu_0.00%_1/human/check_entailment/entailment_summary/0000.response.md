Reasoning:  
The program's goal is to select `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these cells is maximized. The program's approach is to start with the cells `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which ensures a basic distance of 1 between the first two points. For `n = 3`, it adds the cell `(2, 3)`, and for `n > 3`, it adds the cell `(2, 4)` and then prints cells `(j, j)` for all `j` from 4 to `n`.

However, this approach is not optimal for maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. Here's why:

1. **For `n = 2`**: The program correctly prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which results in the set of distances \(\{0, 1\}\) with size 2. This is correct.

2. **For `n = 3`**: The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`. The set of distances is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) with size 4. This is correct.

3. **For `n > 3`**: The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and then `(j, j)` for all `j` from 4 to `n`. This approach is problematic because:
   - The distances between `(1, 1)` and `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n` are all the same, which is `2 * (j - 1)`.
   - The distances between `(1, 2)` and `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n` are also the same, which is `2 * (j - 1) - 1`.
   - The distances between `(2, 4)` and `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n` are all the same, which is `2 * (j - 2)`.
   - The distances between `(j, j)` and `(k, k)` for `j` and `k` from 4 to `n` are all the same, which is `2 * (k - j)`.

This results in many repeated distances, which does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

A better approach would be to select points that are more spread out across the grid to ensure a larger variety of distances. For example, one could use a strategy that places points at the corners and along the edges of the grid to maximize the number of distinct distances.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for `n > 3`.
