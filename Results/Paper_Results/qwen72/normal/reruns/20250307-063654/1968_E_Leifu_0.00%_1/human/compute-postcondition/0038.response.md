Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `j` is 4.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break down the execution step by step:

1. The variable `j` is explicitly given as 4.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string `"4"`.
3. The `print` statement concatenates the string `"4"` with a space and another string `"4"`, resulting in the string `"4 4"`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **4 4**
