The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement that explicitly prints the string `'2 4'`. This string is not dependent on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state (i.e., `t`, `i`, or `n`). Therefore, the output will be exactly as specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **2 4**
