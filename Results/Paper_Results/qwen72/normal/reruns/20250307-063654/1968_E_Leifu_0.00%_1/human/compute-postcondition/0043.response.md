Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is `n`**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged as an input integer within the range 1 to 50, and `i` remains 2. The loop variable `j` will have reached the value of `n`, and for the loop to have executed at least `n-3` times (since it starts from 4), `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. However, since the loop runs up to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to itself, which is always true. Thus, the final state of `j` will be `n`.
