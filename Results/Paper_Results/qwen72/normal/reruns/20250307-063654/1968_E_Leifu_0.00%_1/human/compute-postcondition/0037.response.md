The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 4, because the loop starts from 4 and goes up to `n + 1`. The variable `j` will be set to 4 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4**
