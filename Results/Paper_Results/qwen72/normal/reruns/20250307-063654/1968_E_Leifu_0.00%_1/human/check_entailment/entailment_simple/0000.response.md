Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. However, the provided program does not correctly achieve this goal for all values of \(n\).

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and the value of \(n\) for each test case.

2. **Output for \(n = 2\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). This is correct because the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2, the maximum possible for \(n = 2\).

3. **Output for \(n = 3\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\). This is correct because the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4, the maximum possible for \(n = 3\).

4. **Output for \(n \geq 4\)**:
   - The program outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     ```
     The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 6. However, the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) is 10, which can be achieved by a different arrangement of points.

5. **General Strategy**:
   - The program's strategy of placing points in a diagonal pattern after the initial points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 4)\) does not ensure that all possible Manhattan distances are covered. A better strategy would be to place points in a way that maximizes the diversity of distances, such as placing points in a spiral or zigzag pattern.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
