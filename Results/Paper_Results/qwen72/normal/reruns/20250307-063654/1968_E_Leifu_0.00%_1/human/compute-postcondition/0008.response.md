The `print('2 4')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'2 4'` directly. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, and `n` do not affect the output of this print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables. The string `'2 4'` is printed as is.

Output: **2 4**
