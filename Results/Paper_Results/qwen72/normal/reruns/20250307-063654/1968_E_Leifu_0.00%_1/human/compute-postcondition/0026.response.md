Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `j` is 5.

The print statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break down what this statement does:
1. `str(j)` converts the integer `j` to a string. Since `j` is 5, `str(j)` will be `'5'`.
2. `' ' + str(j)` concatenates a space and the string representation of `j`, resulting in `' 5'`.
3. `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates the string representation of `j`, a space, and the string representation of `j` again, resulting in `'5 5'`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **5 5**
