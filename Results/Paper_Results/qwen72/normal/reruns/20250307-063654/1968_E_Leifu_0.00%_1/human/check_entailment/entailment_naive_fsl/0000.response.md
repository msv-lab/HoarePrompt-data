Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to provide a correct solution for \( n \geq 4 \). For example, when \( n = 4 \), the program outputs the following points:

```
1 1
1 2
2 4
3 3
4 4
```

However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\). The correct output for \( n = 4 \) should be something like:

```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```

This arrangement ensures that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) contains the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances. The program's logic for \( n \geq 4 \) is flawed, as it does not consider the optimal placement of points to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
