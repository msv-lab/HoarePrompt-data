Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer.** 

The value of `n` is now set to the integer input provided, and the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions for `j` and the value of `n` before the input are not affected by this code snippet.
