Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `j` is 6.

The print statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `j` is explicitly given as 6.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string `'6'`.
3. The `print` statement concatenates the string `'6'` with a space `' '` and another `'6'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **6 6**
