Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is `t - 1`. For each of the `t` test cases, if `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, which is the last index of the loop. For each of the `t` test cases, the value of `n` will remain unchanged. If `n` was 3, the loop will have printed '2 3' for that test case. If `n` was greater than or equal to 4, the loop will have printed '2 4' and then iterated through the range from 4 to `n`, printing each value of `j` followed by itself. The variable `j` will be set to `n + 1` for the last test case where `n` was greater than or equal to 4. If `n` was less than 3, the value of `n` remains unchanged and `j` is not modified.
