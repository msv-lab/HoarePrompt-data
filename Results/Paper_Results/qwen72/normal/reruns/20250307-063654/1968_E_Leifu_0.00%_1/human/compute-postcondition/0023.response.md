The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `4` and `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n + 1` must be greater than `4`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to `4`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50 (this is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).
- `i` is 1 (this is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).
- `n` is an input integer, if `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. The variable `j` will start from 4 and iterate up to `n`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4**
