The code snippet contains a `print` statement that explicitly prints the string `'1 2'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the exact string specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **1 2**
