Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n + 1`**

In natural language, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 50, `i` remains 0, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 (as it was a precondition for the loop to execute at least once). The variable `j` will have the value `n + 1`, which is the next integer after the last iteration of the loop.
