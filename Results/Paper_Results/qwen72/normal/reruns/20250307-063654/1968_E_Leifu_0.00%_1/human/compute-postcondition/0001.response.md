For the loop to execute, the only variables in the loop head that can be adjusted are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0. Given the initial state, `t` is already within the range 1 to 50, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0, and `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 0**
