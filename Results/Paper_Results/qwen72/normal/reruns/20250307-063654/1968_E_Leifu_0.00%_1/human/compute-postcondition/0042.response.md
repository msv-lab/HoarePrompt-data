Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
   - `j` is 6.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly given as 6.
   - The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string '6'.
   - The `print` statement concatenates this string with a space and another instance of the same string.
   - Therefore, the final string to be printed is '6 6'.

4. **Output:**
   Output: **6 6**
