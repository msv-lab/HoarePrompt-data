The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 5, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 5**
