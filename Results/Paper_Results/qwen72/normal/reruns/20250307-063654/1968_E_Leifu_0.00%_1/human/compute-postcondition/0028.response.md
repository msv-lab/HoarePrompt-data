Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
   - `j` is 6.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The variable `j` is explicitly defined as 6.
   - The `print` statement converts `j` to a string and concatenates it with a space and itself again.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string "6 6".

4. **Final Output**:
   Output: **6 6**
