### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and ensures \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and ensures \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \).

2. **Output for \( n = 2 \):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct and maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

3. **Output for \( n = 3 \):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct and maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

4. **Output for \( n \geq 4 \):**
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     5 5
     ...
     n n
     ```
   - For \( n = 4 \), the output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
   - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), but this is not the optimal solution. The optimal solution should be:
     ```
     1 1
     1 3
     4 3
     4 4
     ```
     - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for this optimal solution is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which contains 7 distinct distances.

5. **General Case for \( n \geq 4 \):**
   - The program always outputs the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((j, j)\) for \( j \) from 4 to \( n \).
   - This pattern does not ensure that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is maximized. The distances between the points are not optimally spread out to cover all possible distinct Manhattan distances.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case \( n \geq 4 \) correctly. The points it outputs do not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
