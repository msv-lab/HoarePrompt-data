Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
  - If `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3.
  - If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 4')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is a simple string literal that does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The string `'2 4'` is a constant and will be printed exactly as it is.

### Output:
Output: **2 4**
