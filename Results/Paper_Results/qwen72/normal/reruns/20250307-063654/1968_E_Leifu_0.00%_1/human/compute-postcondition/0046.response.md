The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will process a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function is expected to handle `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. The function returns the results of processing these test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3 and returns the results of processing these test cases.**
