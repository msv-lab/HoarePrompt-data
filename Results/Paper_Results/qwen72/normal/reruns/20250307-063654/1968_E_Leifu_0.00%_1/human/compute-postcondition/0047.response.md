Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3. It then prints the pairs (1, 1) and (1, 2). If `n` is 3, it prints the pair (2, 3). If `n` is greater than 3, it prints the pair (2, 4) and then prints pairs (j, j) for all integers `j` from 4 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
