Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program only prints a fixed pattern of points for \(n = 2\) and \(n = 3\), and for \(n > 3\), it prints a pattern that does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
3 3
4 4
```
However, the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1|+|1-1|, |1-1|+|1-2|, |1-2|+|1-4|, |1-3|+|1-3|, |1-4|+|1-4|, |1-2|+|2-4|, |1-3|+|2-3|, |1-4|+|2-4|, |2-3|+|4-3|, |2-4|+|4-4|, |3-4|+|3-4| \}
\]
Simplifying these distances:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ 0, 1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 5, 2, 4, 2 \}
\]
After removing duplicates:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}
\]
This set has 7 distinct distances, but it is not guaranteed to be the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\).

A correct approach would involve a more systematic method to place the points in such a way that the number of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized. For example, placing points along the diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the grid can often help achieve this goal.
