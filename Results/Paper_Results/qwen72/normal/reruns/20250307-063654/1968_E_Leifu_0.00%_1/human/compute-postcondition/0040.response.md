Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
   - `j` is 5.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly given as 5.
   - The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string `'5'`.
   - The `print` statement then concatenates this string with a space and another instance of the string `'5'`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'5 5'`.

Output: **5 5**
