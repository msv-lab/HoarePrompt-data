The `print('1 1')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'1 1'`. 

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- If `n` is 3, the value of `n` remains 3.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.

However, none of these variables or conditions affect the `print` statement, which simply prints the string `'1 1'`.

Output: **1 1**
