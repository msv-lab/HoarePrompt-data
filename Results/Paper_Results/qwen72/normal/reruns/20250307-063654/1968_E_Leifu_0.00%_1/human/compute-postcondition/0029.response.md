Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an input integer within the range 1 to 50.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 1.
- The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute at all.
- The variable `j` will have the value of `n` after the loop has completed all its iterations. This is because the loop starts at `j = 4` and increments `j` by 1 for each iteration, stopping when `j` reaches `n + 1`. Therefore, the last value of `j` before the loop exits is `n`.
