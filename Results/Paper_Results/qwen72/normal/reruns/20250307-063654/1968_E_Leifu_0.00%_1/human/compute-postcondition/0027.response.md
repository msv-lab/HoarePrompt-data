The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 6, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 6 for the loop condition to hold.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6**
