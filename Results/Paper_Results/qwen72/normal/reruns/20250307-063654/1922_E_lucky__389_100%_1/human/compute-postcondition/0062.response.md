The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `subseq_lens`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `subseq_lens`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `subseq_lens` must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `subseq_lens` must still have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`func_1` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is now 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values of `i - 1` for each iteration where \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not 0, and `subseq_lens` must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` encountered during the loop execution, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and the values of `subseq_lens[1]` and `subseq_lens[2]`, `i` is 3**
