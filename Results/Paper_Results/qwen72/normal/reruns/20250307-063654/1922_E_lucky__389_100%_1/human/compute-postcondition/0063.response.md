Output State: **`func_1` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is now 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values of `i - 1` for each iteration where \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not 0, and `subseq_lens` must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` encountered during the loop execution, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and the values of `subseq_lens[1]`, `subseq_lens[2]`, and `subseq_lens[3]`, `i` is 3.**
