The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `2 ** i` (which is `2 ** 3` or 8) must be less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, `x` must be greater than or equal to 8. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 8, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 3**
