The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 2.5. For the loop to execute one more time, `2 ** i` (which is `2 ** 2` or 4) must be less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, `x` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value -1, `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and -1, `x` must be greater than 0**
