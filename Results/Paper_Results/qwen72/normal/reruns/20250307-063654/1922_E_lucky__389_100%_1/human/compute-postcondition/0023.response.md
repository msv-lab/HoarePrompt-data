Postcondition: ***`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 0, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\). If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is now equal to `x - 2`.***
