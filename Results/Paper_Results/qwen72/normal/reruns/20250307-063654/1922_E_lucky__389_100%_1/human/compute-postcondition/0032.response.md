Output State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` must be greater than or equal to 2 ** `i` - 1, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 ** `i` > `x`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The function `func_1` remains incomplete and does not match the problem description.
- The input integer `x` must be greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `i` minus 1, where `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 raised to the power of `i` is greater than `x`.
- The list `subseq_lens` is either empty or contains the value `i - 1`.
- The variable `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`.
- The variable `i` is the smallest integer such that 2 raised to the power of `i` is greater than `x`.
