The `print` statement in the given code snippet will print the element at index `i` of the list `ansv`, followed by a space. According to the initial state, `i` is 1, so the element at index 1 of the list `ansv` will be printed.

Since the initial state only specifies that `ansv` must have at least two elements, the exact value of `ansv[1]` is not provided. However, we know that it is the second element of the list `ansv`.

Output: **[ansv[1]] (where ansv[1] is the second element of the list ansv)**
