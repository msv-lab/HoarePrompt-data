The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 4, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and `i` is now 3.
