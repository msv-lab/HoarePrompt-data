You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the standard input. If `X` is 2, it prints `1` followed by `0` and returns `None`. For other values of `X`, it constructs a list `ansv` such that the number of increasing subsequences in `ansv` is exactly `X`. It then prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, and finally a newline. The function always returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements that are strictly increasing and maintain their relative order in the original array.
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Approach:**
   - The program attempts to construct the array by breaking down \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2. This is because the number of increasing subsequences can be represented as a sum of binomial coefficients, which are powers of 2.
   - For each power of 2, it appends the corresponding index to the array `subseq_lens`.
   - Finally, it constructs the array `ansv` by appending the indices from `subseq_lens` and prints the result.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - **Function `func_1()`:**
     - It reads the integer \( x \) for each test case.
     - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the indices of the powers of 2.
     - It initializes `mx` to keep track of the maximum index.
     - If \( x \) is 2, it prints a single element array with 0, which is correct because the array [0] has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: [0] and the empty subsequence.
     - It enters a loop to break down \( x \) into a sum of powers of 2:
       - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( x \) and appends the corresponding index to `subseq_lens`.
       - It subtracts the value of this power of 2 from \( x \).
       - It updates `mx` to the maximum index found.
     - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by appending the indices from `subseq_lens`.
     - It prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly breaks down \( x \) into a sum of powers of 2, which is a valid approach to construct an array with exactly \( x \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by appending the indices of the powers of 2, which ensures that the subsequences are increasing.
   - The program handles the special case \( x = 2 \) correctly.
   - The program ensures that the length of the array is at most 200 by breaking down \( x \) into at most 200 powers of 2 (since \( 2^{200} \) is much larger than \( 10^{18} \)).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( x = 2 \) by printing a single element array.
   - For other values of \( x \), it constructs the array by breaking down \( x \) into powers of 2, which is a valid approach.

6. **Output Range:**
   - The elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) as required.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach to constructing an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. It handles the input and output correctly and ensures the array length is at most 200.

Correctness: **True**
