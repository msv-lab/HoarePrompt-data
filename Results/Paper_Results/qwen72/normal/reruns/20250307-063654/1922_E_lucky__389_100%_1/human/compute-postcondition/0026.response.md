To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 0.
- `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `i - 1` (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of 0 and `i - 1` (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `i` is now 0.
- If `i` was 0 before, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- Otherwise, `x` is now equal to `x - 2` and `x` is not equal to 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
while 2 ** i <= x:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`.
- `i` is currently 0.
- `2 ** 0` is 1.
- For the loop to execute, `1 <= x` must be true.
- Given that `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 0, `x` can be any integer except 0.

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is 0, `2 ** i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The current state of `x` is that it is an input integer and not equal to 0, which means `x` can be any positive or negative integer except 0.
- To ensure the loop condition `2 ** i <= x` is true, `x` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and `i` is now 0.**
