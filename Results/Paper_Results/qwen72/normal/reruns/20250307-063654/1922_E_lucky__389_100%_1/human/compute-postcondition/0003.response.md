Postcondition: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the integer `X` and possibly a list of test cases `t`. The function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `X` in the range [2, 10^18], and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. `x` is an input integer and its current value is 2. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is 0.**
