### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called in a loop for each test case, which is correct.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not take any parameters, which is a deviation from the problem description. It should take `X` as a parameter.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly handles the special case when `x == 2` by printing `1` followed by `0`. This is accurate because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop `while x != 0` is intended to break down `x` into powers of 2. This is a good approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.
   - The inner loop `while 2 ** i <= x` finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and appends `i - 1` to `subseq_lens`. This is correct in theory but has a logical flaw when `x` is a power of 2.

4. **Logical Flaw:**
   - When `x` is a power of 2, the program subtracts `2 ** (i - 1)` from `x` and appends `i - 1` to `subseq_lens`. This is incorrect because it should subtract `2 ** i` from `x` and append `i` to `subseq_lens`.
   - For example, if `x = 4`, the program will:
     - Find `i = 2` (since \(2^2 = 4\)).
     - Subtract \(2^{(2-1)} = 2\) from `x`, making `x = 2`.
     - Append `1` to `subseq_lens`.
     - Find `i = 1` (since \(2^1 = 2\)).
     - Subtract \(2^{(1-1)} = 1\) from `x`, making `x = 1`.
     - Append `0` to `subseq_lens`.
     - Find `i = 1` (since \(2^0 = 1\)).
     - Subtract \(2^{(0)} = 1\) from `x`, making `x = 0`.
     - Append `0` to `subseq_lens`.
   - The resulting `subseq_lens` will be `[1, 0, 0]`, which is incorrect. The correct `subseq_lens` should be `[2]` because \(4 = 2^2\).

5. **Array Construction:**
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by appending integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and then appending the values from `subseq_lens[1:]`.
   - This construction is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where `x` is a power of 2, leading to an incorrect array length and elements.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.
   - For `x = 4`, the function will print `3` followed by `0 1 0`, which does not have exactly 4 increasing subsequences.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case when `x` is a power of 2, leading to an incorrect count of increasing subsequences and an incorrect array length. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
