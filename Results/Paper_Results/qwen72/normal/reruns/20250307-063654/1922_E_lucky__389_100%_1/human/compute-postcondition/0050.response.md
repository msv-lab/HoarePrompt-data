Output State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\) and the current value of `i` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value -1, `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and -1, `x` must be greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
