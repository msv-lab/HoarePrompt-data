Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

2. **Base Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the base case where `X` is 2. For `X = 2`, the only possible array is `[0]` because it has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.

3. **Subsequence Construction**: The program attempts to construct an array `ansv` such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. It does this by repeatedly finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `X` and subtracting it from `X`. This approach is based on the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length `n` can be represented as a sum of powers of 2.

4. **Subsequence Length Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the length of the array `ansv` and appends the indices of the powers of 2 used to the array. This ensures that the array is constructed in a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the length of the array `ansv` and the elements of the array, which is the correct format for the output.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

- **Handling of `X = 1`**: The problem description states that `X` is in the range `[2, 10^18]`, but the program does not handle `X = 1` explicitly. This is not a problem since `X = 1` is not a valid input, but it's worth noting.

- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle cases where `X` is a power of 2 or a sum of powers of 2 correctly. The logic in the program seems to be designed to handle these cases, but it's important to verify that it works for all edge cases.

- **Element Range**: The problem description specifies that all elements of the array should be in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`. The program constructs the array using non-negative integers, which are within the specified range.

- **Subsequence Counting**: The program's logic for constructing the array is based on the idea that the number of increasing subsequences can be represented as a sum of powers of 2. This is a valid approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length `n` is `2^n - 1` (including the empty subsequence).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct for the given problem description and input constraints.

Correctness: **True**
