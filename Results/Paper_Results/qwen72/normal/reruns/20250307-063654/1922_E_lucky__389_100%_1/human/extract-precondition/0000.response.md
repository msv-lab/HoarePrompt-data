Precondition: **The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the integer `X` and possibly a list of test cases `t`. The function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `X` in the range [2, 10^18], and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists.**

For a more accurate function definition, it should look like this:
```python
def find_array_with_x_subsequences(t, X):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000, and X is a list of integers where each integer x in X satisfies 2 <= x <= 10^18.**
