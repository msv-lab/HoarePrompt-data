Postcondition: ***`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\), `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value -1, `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and -1, `x` must be greater than 0, and `i` is not equal to 0***
