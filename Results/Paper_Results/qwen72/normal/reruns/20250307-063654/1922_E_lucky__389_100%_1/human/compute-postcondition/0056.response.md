Output State: **The loop has finished executing, `func_1` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is now 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values of `i - 1` for each iteration where \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not 0, and `mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` encountered during the loop execution.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the input integer `x` has been reduced to 0 by repeatedly subtracting powers of 2. The list `subseq_lens` contains the lengths of these powers of 2 (each reduced by 1) that were used to decrement `x`. The variable `mx` holds the largest length (reduced by 1) that was appended to `subseq_lens`. The function `func_1` remains incomplete and does not match the problem description.
