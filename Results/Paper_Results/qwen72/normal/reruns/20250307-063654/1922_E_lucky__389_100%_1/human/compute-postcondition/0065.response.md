Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `func_1` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description.
2. `x` is now 0.
3. `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values of `i - 1` for each iteration where \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not 0.
4. `mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` encountered during the loop execution.
5. `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and the values of `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]`.
6. `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `subseq_lens`**:
   - Since `x` is 0, the condition \(2^i > x\) will always be true for any positive `i`.
   - The loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as \(2^i > 0\), which is always true for positive `i`.
   - However, the loop will stop when `i` is no longer positive, i.e., when `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, `subseq_lens` will contain the values of `i - 1` for each `i` from 1 to the maximum `i` where \(2^i > 0\).
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments, the values of `i - 1` will be 0, 1, 2, ..., until the loop stops.

2. **Determine `mx`**:
   - `mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` encountered during the loop execution.
   - The maximum value of `i - 1` will be the last value in `subseq_lens` before the loop stops.
   - Since the loop stops when `i` is 0, the maximum value of `i - 1` will be the last value in the list, which is `len(subseq_lens) - 2`.

3. **Determine `ansv`**:
   - `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and the values of `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]`.
   - `mx` is the last value in `subseq_lens`, which is `len(subseq_lens) - 2`.
   - Therefore, `ansv` will contain integers from 0 to `len(subseq_lens) - 3` and the values of `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 2]`.

4. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.

### Final Calculation:
- `subseq_lens` will be a list of values starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 until the loop stops.
- The length of `subseq_lens` will be the number of iterations of the loop, which is the maximum `i` where \(2^i > 0\).
- Since the loop stops when `i` is 0, the length of `subseq_lens` will be the maximum `i` + 1.
- `mx` will be `len(subseq_lens) - 2`.
- `ansv` will contain integers from 0 to `len(subseq_lens) - 3` and the values of `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 2]`.
- The length of `ansv` will be the number of integers from 0 to `len(subseq_lens) - 3` plus the number of elements in `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 2]`.

### Example:
- If `subseq_lens` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, then:
  - `mx` is `3 - 2 = 1`.
  - `ansv` will be `[0, 1, 2]` (integers from 0 to `1 - 1` plus `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[3 - 1]`).
  - The length of `ansv` is 3.

### General Case:
- The length of `subseq_lens` is `len(subseq_lens)`.
- The length of `ansv` is `len(subseq_lens) - 2` (integers from 0 to `len(subseq_lens) - 3`) plus `len(subseq_lens) - 2` (values from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 2]`).

### Final Output:
- The length of `ansv` is `2 * (len(subseq_lens) - 2)`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **2 * (len(subseq_lens) - 2)**

This is the most precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the code snippet.
