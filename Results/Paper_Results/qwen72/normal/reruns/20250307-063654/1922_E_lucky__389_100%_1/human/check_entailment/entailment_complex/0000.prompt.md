Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    t = int(input())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the integer `X` and possibly a list of test cases `t`. The function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `X` in the range [2, 10^18], and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0

    #State: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the integer `X` and possibly a list of test cases `t`. The function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `X` in the range [2, 10^18], and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `x` is not equal to 2.
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, `func_1` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is now 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values of `i - 1` for each iteration where \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not 0, and `mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` encountered during the loop execution.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `func_1` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is now 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values of `i - 1` for each iteration where \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not 0, `mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` encountered during the loop execution, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and the values of `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]`, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 2 * (len(subseq_lens) - 2)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `ansv` has been fully iterated, `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the standard input. If `X` is 2, it prints `1` followed by `0` and returns `None`. For other values of `X`, it constructs a list `ansv` such that the number of increasing subsequences in `ansv` is exactly `X`. It then prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, and finally a newline. The function always returns `None`.
