The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is now equal to the original value of `x` minus 2 raised to the power of `i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be greater than 0 after this adjustment.

State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is not 0, `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value `i - 1`, `x` is now equal to the original value of `x` minus 2 raised to the power of `i - 1`, and `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and `i - 1`. `x` must be greater than 0.**
