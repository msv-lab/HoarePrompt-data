### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements that are strictly increasing and maintain their relative order in the original array.
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Approach:**
   - The program attempts to construct the array by breaking down \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2. This is because the number of increasing subsequences can be represented as a sum of binomial coefficients, which are powers of 2.
   - For each power of 2, it appends the corresponding index to the array `subseq_lens`.
   - Finally, it constructs the array `ansv` by appending the indices from `subseq_lens` and prints the result.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - **Function `func_1()`:**
     - It reads the integer \( x \) for each test case.
     - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the indices of the powers of 2.
     - It initializes `mx` to keep track of the maximum index.
     - If \( x \) is 2, it prints a single element array with 0, which is correct because the array [0] has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: [0] and the empty subsequence.
     - It enters a loop to break down \( x \) into a sum of powers of 2:
       - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( x \) and appends the corresponding index to `subseq_lens`.
       - It subtracts the value of this power of 2 from \( x \).
       - It updates `mx` to the maximum index found.
     - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by appending the indices from `subseq_lens`.
     - It prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly breaks down \( x \) into a sum of powers of 2, which is a valid approach to construct an array with exactly \( x \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by appending the indices of the powers of 2, which ensures that the subsequences are increasing.
   - The program handles the special case \( x = 2 \) correctly.
   - The program ensures that the length of the array is at most 200 by breaking down \( x \) into at most 200 powers of 2 (since \( 2^{200} \) is much larger than \( 10^{18} \)).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( x = 2 \) by printing a single element array.
   - For other values of \( x \), it constructs the array by breaking down \( x \) into powers of 2, which is a valid approach.

6. **Output Range:**
   - The elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) as required.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach to constructing an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. It handles the input and output correctly and ensures the array length is at most 200.

Correctness: **True**
