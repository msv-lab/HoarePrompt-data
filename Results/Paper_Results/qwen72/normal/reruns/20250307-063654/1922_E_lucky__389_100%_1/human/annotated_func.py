#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the integer `X` and possibly a list of test cases `t`. The function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `X` in the range [2, 10^18], and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists.

The function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `X` in the range [2, 10^18], and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `x` is not equal to 2.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the standard input. If `X` is 2, it prints `1` followed by `0` and returns `None`. For other values of `X`, it constructs a list `ansv` such that the number of increasing subsequences in `ansv` is exactly `X`. It then prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, and finally a newline. The function always returns `None`.
