Output State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and `i` is now 1.**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
