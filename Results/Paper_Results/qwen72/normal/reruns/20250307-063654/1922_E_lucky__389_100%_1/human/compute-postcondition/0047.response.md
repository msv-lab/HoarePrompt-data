Output State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value -1, `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and -1, `x` must be greater than 0.** 

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 3. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
