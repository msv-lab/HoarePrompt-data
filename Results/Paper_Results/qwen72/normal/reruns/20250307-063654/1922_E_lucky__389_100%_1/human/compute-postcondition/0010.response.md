The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `2 ** i <= x` must be true.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 0.
- `i` is 0.

Let's analyze the condition:
- `2 ** 0` is 1.
- For `2 ** 0 <= x` to be true, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Since `x` is already given as an integer and not equal to 0, `x` can be either positive or negative. However, for the loop to execute, `x` must be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1).

No adjustment is needed for `i` since it is already 0, which is the smallest value that allows the loop to start.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `x` is a positive integer.

State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 0**
