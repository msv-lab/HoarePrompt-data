The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `2 ** i` (which is `2 ** 1` or 2) must be less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, `x` must be at least 2 for the loop to proceed.

State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and `i` is now 1**
