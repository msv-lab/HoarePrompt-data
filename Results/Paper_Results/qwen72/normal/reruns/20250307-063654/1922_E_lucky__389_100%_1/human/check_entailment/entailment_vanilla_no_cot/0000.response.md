Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Input and Output Format**:
   - The function `func_1` is called inside a loop, but it should be called with the input `x` directly.
   - The program does not handle the input and output format correctly. It should read the number of test cases `t` and then process each test case by reading `x` and printing the result.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing the Array**:
   - The logic for constructing the array `ansv` is flawed. The program attempts to subtract powers of 2 from `x` to find the lengths of the subsequences, but it does not correctly ensure that the resulting array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The program does not handle the case where `x` is a power of 2 correctly. For example, if `x` is 4, the program should not subtract 2 from `x` and then append 1 to `subseq_lens`.

3. **Incorrect Array Construction**:
   - The array `ansv` is constructed in a way that does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences. For example, if `x` is 5, the program might construct an array that does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that should work correctly:

```python
import math

def func_1(x):
    if x == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    
    subseq_lens = []
    while x > 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        i -= 1
        subseq_lens.append(i)
        x -= 2 ** i
    
    if x != 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    ansv = []
    for i in subseq_lens:
        ansv.extend([0] * (i - len(ansv)) + [1])
    
    print(len(ansv))
    print(*ansv)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        func_1(x)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `x` and calling `func_1(x)`.
- **Subsequence Construction**: The program constructs the array by appending `1` to the array and ensuring that the array has the correct number of increasing subsequences.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where `x` is 1 by printing `-1` (since no array of length at most 200 can have exactly 1 increasing subsequence).

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
