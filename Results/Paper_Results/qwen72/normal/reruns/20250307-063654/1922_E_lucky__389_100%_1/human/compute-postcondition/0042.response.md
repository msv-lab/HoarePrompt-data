To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

- **`i` is 0**: This is the initial value of `i`.
- **`x` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2**: This is the initial condition for `x`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is now `x - 0.5` (where `x` was originally an integer greater than or equal to 2).

Let's break it down:
1. **Initial Condition for `x`**: The original value of `x` was an integer greater than or equal to 2.
2. **Current Value of `x`**: `x` is now `x - 0.5`, so the current value of `x` is `x - 0.5` where `x` was originally an integer greater than or equal to 2.
3. **Condition for the Loop**: The loop will execute if `2 ** i <= x`. Since `i` is 0, `2 ** i` is `1`.

For the loop to execute the first time:
- `1 <= x - 0.5` must be true.
- This simplifies to `x >= 1.5`.

Since `x` was originally an integer greater than or equal to 2, `x - 0.5` will always be greater than or equal to 1.5. Therefore, the loop condition will be satisfied.

No adjustments are needed to the state of `i` or `x` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value `i - 1` (which is -1), `x` is now `x - 0.5`, and `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and `i - 1` (which is -1). `x` must be greater than 0.**
