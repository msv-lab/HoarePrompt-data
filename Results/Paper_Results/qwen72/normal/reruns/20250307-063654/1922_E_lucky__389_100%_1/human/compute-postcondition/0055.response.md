Postcondition: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\), `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value -1, `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and -1. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` also includes the value \(i - 1\), `mx` is the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and \(i - 1\), `x` is now equal to `x - 2`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
