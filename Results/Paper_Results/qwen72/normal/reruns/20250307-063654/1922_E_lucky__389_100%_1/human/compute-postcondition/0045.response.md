Output State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2.5, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value -1, `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and -1, `x` must be greater than 0.**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
