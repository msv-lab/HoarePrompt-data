Output State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is 0, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not equal to 0, `x` is now equal to `x - 2 ** (i - 1)`**. 

The value of `x` has been updated by subtracting \(2^{(i - 1)}\) from it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
