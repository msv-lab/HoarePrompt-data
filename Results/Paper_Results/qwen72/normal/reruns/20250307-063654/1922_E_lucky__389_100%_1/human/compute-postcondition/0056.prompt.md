Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the integer `X` and possibly a list of test cases `t`. The function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `X` in the range [2, 10^18], and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `x` is not equal to 2.
Code of the loop:
while x != 0:
    i = 0
    while 2 ** i <= x:
        i += 1
    if i == 0:
        break
    else:
        subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
        x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
        mx = max(mx, i - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 0, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is either 0 or the maximum of 0 and `i - 1`, and `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\). If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is now equal to `x - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is not 0, `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value `i - 1`, `x` is now equal to the original value of `x` minus 2 raised to the power of `i - 1`, and `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and `i - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\), `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value -1, `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and -1. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` also includes the value \(i - 1\), `mx` is the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and \(i - 1\), `x` is now equal to `x - 2`, and `i` is not equal to 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
