The `print` statement in the given code snippet will print the element at index 0 of the list `ansv`, followed by a space. Since the initial state specifies that `ansv` must have at least one element and `i` is 0, the element at index 0 of `ansv` will be printed.

Output: **[ansv[0]] (where ansv[0] is the first element of the list ansv)**
