Output State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\), `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the values -1 and \(i - 1\), `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and -1, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `x` is now equal to `x - 2 ** (i - 1)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x - 2 ** (i - 1)`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
