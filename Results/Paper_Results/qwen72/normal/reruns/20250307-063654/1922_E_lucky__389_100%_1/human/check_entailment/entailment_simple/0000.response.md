Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect. It should take the integer `X` as a parameter.
   - The function reads `x` from input inside the loop, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. The function should be called with the test case values.

2. **Initial Handling for `x == 2`**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x == 2` by printing `1` and `0`, which is a valid output since the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop attempts to decompose `x` into a sum of powers of 2, which is a good approach for constructing an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - However, the loop should handle the case where `x` is reduced to 0 correctly. The current implementation breaks the loop when `i == 0`, which is not necessary since the loop already ensures `2 ** i > x`.

4. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The program constructs the array `ansv` by appending integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and then appending the values from `subseq_lens[1:]`.
   - This approach is not entirely correct. The array should be constructed to ensure it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The current logic does not guarantee this.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv`.
   - The length of `ansv` is not necessarily correct, and the elements may not form an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where no such array exists. It should print `-1` if it is impossible to find an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not fully match the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
