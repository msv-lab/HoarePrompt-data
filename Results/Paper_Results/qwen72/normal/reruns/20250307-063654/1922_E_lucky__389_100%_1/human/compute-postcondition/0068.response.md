The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `ansv`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(ansv)` must be true. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `ansv` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented to 1, and `ansv` must have at least two elements to satisfy the condition `i < len(ansv)`.

State: **`ansv` must have at least two elements, `i` is 1**
