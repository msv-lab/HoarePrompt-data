You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the integer `X` and possibly a list of test cases `t`. The function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `X` in the range [2, 10^18], and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns `None`.
    #State: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the integer `X` and possibly a list of test cases `t`. The function should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `X` in the range [2, 10^18], and return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and `x` is not equal to 2.
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, `func_1` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is now 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values of `i - 1` for each iteration where \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not 0, and `mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` encountered during the loop execution.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `func_1` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is now 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values of `i - 1` for each iteration where \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not 0, `mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` encountered during the loop execution, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and the values of `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]`, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 2 * (len(subseq_lens) - 2)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `ansv` has been fully iterated, `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `X` and a list of test cases `t`. For each test case, if `X` is in the range [2, 10^18], the function returns an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `None`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
