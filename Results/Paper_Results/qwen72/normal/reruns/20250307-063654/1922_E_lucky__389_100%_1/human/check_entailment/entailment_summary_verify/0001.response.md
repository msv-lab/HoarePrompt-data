### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing an array of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements that are strictly increasing and maintain their relative order in the original array.
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Approach:**
   - The program attempts to construct the array by breaking down \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2. This is because the number of increasing subsequences can be represented as a sum of binomial coefficients, which are powers of 2.
   - For each power of 2, it appends the corresponding index to the array `subseq_lens`.
   - Finally, it constructs the array `ansv` by appending the indices from `subseq_lens` and prints the result.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - **Function `func_1()`:**
     - It reads the integer \( x \) for each test case.
     - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the indices of the powers of 2.
     - It initializes `mx` to keep track of the maximum index.
     - If \( x \) is 2, it prints a single element array with 0, which is correct because the array [0] has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: [0] and the empty subsequence.
     - It enters a loop to break down \( x \) into a sum of powers of 2:
       - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( x \) and appends the corresponding index to `subseq_lens`.
       - It subtracts the value of this power of 2 from \( x \).
       - It updates `mx` to the maximum index found.
     - After the loop, it constructs the array `ansv` by appending the indices from `subseq_lens`.
     - It prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly breaks down \( x \) into a sum of powers of 2, which is a valid approach to construct an array with exactly \( x \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by appending the indices of the powers of 2, which ensures that the subsequences are increasing.
   - The program handles the special case \( x = 2 \) correctly.
   - The program ensures that the length of the array is at most 200 by breaking down \( x \) into at most 200 powers of 2 (since \( 2^{200} \) is much larger than \( 10^{18} \)).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( x = 2 \) by printing a single element array.
   - For other values of \( x \), it constructs the array by breaking down \( x \) into powers of 2, which is a valid approach.

6. **Output Range:**
   - The elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) as required.

### Challenges and Corrections:
- **Special Case for \( x = 1 \):**
  - The program does not handle the case where \( x = 1 \). According to the problem, the array [0] should have exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and [0]). However, for \( x = 1 \), the correct output should be an array with exactly 1 increasing subsequence, which is the empty subsequence. The program should handle this case by printing `-1` if \( x = 1 \).

- **Loop Termination:**
  - The loop `while x != 0:` should be `while x > 0:` to avoid an infinite loop when \( x \) is 1.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if x == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x > 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was mostly accurate but overlooked the special case where \( x = 1 \).
- The program needs to handle \( x = 1 \) by printing `-1` and should terminate the loop correctly when \( x \) becomes 0.

Final: **False**
