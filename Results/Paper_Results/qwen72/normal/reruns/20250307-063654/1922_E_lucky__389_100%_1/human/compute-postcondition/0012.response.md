The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `2 ** i <= x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `2 ** i` must still be less than or equal to `x` after `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be incremented to 2, and `x` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since `2 ** 2 = 4`).

State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` must be greater than or equal to 4, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 2**
