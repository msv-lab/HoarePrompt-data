Output State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `subseq_lens` is a list that now includes the value -1, `x` is now `x - 0.5`, and `mx` is now the maximum of the previous value of `mx` and -1. `x` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
