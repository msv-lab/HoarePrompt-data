Output State: **`func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`func_1`**: The function is still incomplete and does not match the problem description.
- **`x`**: The value of `x` remains the same as the input integer, and it is not equal to 0.
- **`subseq_lens`**: The list `subseq_lens` remains empty because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`mx`**: The variable `mx` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is incremented until \(2^i\) is greater than `x`. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `i` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\). This means that `i` will be the smallest integer for which the condition `2 ** i <= x` is no longer true.
