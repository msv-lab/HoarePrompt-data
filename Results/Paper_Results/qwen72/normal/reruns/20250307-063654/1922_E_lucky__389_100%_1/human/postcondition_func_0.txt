The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the standard input. If `X` is 2, it prints `1` followed by `0` and returns `None`. For other values of `X`, it constructs a list `ansv` such that the number of increasing subsequences in `ansv` is exactly `X`. It then prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` separated by spaces, and finally a newline. The function always returns `None`.
