The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `subseq_lens`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop increments `i` and the conditions under which the loop continues.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- `subseq_lens` must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- The loop condition `i < len(subseq_lens)` must still be true. Since `subseq_lens` must have at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute again, `subseq_lens` must have at least 3 elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`func_1` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description, `x` is now 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values of `i - 1` for each iteration where \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not 0, and `subseq_lens` must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` encountered during the loop execution, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and the value of `subseq_lens[1]`, `i` is 2**
