The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure that `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a, a]`, `i` is 2, `L` is the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a` and `b` are now assigned new input integer values.**
