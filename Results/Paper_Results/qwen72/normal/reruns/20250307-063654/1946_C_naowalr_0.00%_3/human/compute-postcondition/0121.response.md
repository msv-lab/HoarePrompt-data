Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R - L > 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is `x`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `L = x` assigns the value of `x` to the variable `L`.
- Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a variable that has a specific value, but we don't know what that value is.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
