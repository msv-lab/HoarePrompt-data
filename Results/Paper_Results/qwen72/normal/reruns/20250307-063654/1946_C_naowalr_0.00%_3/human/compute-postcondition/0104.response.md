Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times. `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`, and `R - L <= 1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `n - 1` times, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n - 1`.
- The variable `adj` will be a list of `n + 1` lists. Each list at index `a` and `b` will contain the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n - 1` times.
- The variables `t`, `z`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `numCuts`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged from their initial or previously assigned values.
- The condition `R - L <= 1` still holds true.
