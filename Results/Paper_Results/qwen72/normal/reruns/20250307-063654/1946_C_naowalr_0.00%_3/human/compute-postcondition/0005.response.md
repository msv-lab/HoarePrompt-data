The code snippet reads a line from the standard input, splits it into two parts, and then converts these parts into integers, assigning them to `a` and `b` respectively. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.**
