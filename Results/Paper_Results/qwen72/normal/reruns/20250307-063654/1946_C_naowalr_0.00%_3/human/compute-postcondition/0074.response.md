Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers, `x` is the result of `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k`. If `numCuts` is equal to `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**

Explanation:
- `x` is updated to the value of `(L + R) // 2`.
- The values of `L` and `R` are determined based on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover` as described in the initial state.
- All other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `leftover`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged.
