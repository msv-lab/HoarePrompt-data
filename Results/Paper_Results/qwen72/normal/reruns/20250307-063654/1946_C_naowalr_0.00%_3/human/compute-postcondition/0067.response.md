Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.**

Explanation:
- The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call to the variable `leftover`.
- The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `leftover` depends on the implementation of the `dfs` function, which is not provided, so it is described as the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.
