Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, and either `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`).**

The value of `R` is updated to 50001, which is the same as the value of `x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
