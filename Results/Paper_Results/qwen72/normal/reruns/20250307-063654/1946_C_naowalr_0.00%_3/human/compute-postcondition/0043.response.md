Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `R - L > 1`. This means that the loop will keep narrowing the gap between `L` and `R` until they are adjacent integers.
- In each iteration, `x` is set to the midpoint of `L` and `R`, and `numCuts` is reset to 0.
- The `dfs(1, 1)` function call is used to determine the `leftover` value, which is the result of some depth-first search operation starting from node 1.
- If the number of cuts (`numCuts`) is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` is equal to `k` and the `leftover` value is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is updated to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `x`.
- The loop will terminate when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1, meaning `R` is `L + 1`.
- At this point, `L` will be the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`. `R` will be `L + 1`, and `numCuts` will be the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`.
