Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `R - L > 1`, `x` is 50001.**

The code snippet `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0, but it does not change any other variables or conditions in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the specific value of `numCuts` being 0.
