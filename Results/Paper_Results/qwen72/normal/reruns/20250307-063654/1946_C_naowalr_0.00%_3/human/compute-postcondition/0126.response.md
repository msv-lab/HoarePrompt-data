Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R - L > 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the integer result of `(L + R) // 2`.**

The code snippet `numCuts = 0` reassigns the variable `numCuts` to 0, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `numCuts` remains 0, and all other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
