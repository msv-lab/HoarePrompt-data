Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value read from the standard input, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`, and `R - L <= 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R - L <= 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
