Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.**

The value of `L` is updated to 50001, which is the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
