The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a]`, `i` is 1, `L` is the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`, `a` and `b` are input integers.**
