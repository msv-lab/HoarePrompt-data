The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` and `k` are positive integers with 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the exact output is not specified.**
