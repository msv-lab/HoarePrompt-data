Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 0, `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`.**

The value of `adj[b]` is updated to include `a`, so `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
