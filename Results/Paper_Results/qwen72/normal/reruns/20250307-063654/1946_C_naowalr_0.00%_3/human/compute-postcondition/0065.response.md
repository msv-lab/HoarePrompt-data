Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers, `x` is 50001.**

Explanation:
- The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`.
- Given `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the expression `(L + R) // 2` evaluates to `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which is `100002 // 2`, resulting in `50001`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
