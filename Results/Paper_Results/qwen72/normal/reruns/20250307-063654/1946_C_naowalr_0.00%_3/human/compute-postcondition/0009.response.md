Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**

The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now specific integers provided by the input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
