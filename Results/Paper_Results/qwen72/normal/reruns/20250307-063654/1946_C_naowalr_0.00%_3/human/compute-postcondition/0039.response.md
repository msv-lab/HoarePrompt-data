Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0.**

The code snippet `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` updates the variable `leftover` with the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `x`, and `numCuts` remain unchanged. The specific value of `leftover` is not provided, but it is now the result of the `dfs` function.
