Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 1, `R` is `L + 1` which is 2, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`, `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers.**
