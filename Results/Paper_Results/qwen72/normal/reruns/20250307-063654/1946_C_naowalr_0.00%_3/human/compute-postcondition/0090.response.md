Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`, and `R - L <= 1`.**

The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))` reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. Since `n` and `k` are reassigned, the new values of `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
