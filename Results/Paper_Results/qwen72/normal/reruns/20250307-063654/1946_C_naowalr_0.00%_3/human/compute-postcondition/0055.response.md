Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a, a]`, `i` is 1, `L` is the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a` and `b` are now assigned new input integer values.**

The code snippet `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contained `[a]`, and after the execution of the code, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
