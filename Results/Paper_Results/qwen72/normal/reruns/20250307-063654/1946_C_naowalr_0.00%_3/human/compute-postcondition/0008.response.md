The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for `i` to be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 1, `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**.
