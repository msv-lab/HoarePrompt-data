The value of `x` is updated to the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Given the initial state, `L` and `R` have specific values based on the conditions provided:

- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001.
- Otherwise, if `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001, and `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.

In both cases, `R - L > 1`.

For the first case:
- `L` is 50001
- `R` is 100001
- `x` becomes `(50001 + 100001) // 2 = 75001`

For the second case:
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 50001
- `x` becomes `(1 + 50001) // 2 = 25001`

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R - L > 1`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, and `x` is 75001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, and `x` is 25001.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R - L > 1`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, and `x` is 75001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, and `x` is 25001.**
