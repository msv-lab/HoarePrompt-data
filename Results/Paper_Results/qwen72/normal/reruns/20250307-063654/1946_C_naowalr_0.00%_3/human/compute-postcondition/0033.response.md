Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 25001, `R` is 50001.**

Explanation:
- The value of `L` is updated to be equal to `x`, which is 25001.
- All other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `x`, `leftover`, `numCuts`, `R`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
