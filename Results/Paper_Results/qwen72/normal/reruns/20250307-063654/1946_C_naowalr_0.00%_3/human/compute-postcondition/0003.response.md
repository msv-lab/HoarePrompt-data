Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.**

The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, and `n` and `k` are input integers. The code snippet creates a list `adj` containing `n + 1` empty lists. The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
