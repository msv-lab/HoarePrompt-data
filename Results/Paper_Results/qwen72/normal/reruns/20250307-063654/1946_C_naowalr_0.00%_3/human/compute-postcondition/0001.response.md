The only objects in the loop head are `z` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer, and `z` should start at 0. The state of `n`, `k`, and `adj` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that `t` is the integer value read from the standard input, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `z` must start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0**
