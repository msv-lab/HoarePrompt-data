Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R` is equal to `x`, `R - L > 1`, `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `R = x` assigns the value of `x` to `R`.
- The initial state does not specify the value of `x`, so `R` is now equal to `x`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
