The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start from 0, which is the default behavior of `range`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 0**
