Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**

The code snippet `numCuts = 0` explicitly sets the value of `numCuts` to 0, which is the same as its initial value. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.
