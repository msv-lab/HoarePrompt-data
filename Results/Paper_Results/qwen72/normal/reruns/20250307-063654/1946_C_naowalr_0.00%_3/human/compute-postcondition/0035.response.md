Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k`, or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 25001 and `R` is 50001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 25001.***
