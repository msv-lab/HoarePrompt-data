The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure that `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`, and `R - L <= 1`. `adj[a]` now contains the integer `b`, and `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a`.**
