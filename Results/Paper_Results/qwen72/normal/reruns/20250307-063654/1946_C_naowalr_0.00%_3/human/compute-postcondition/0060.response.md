Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`, `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers.**

In natural language, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `z` remains 1.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
- The variable `k` remains an input integer.
- The variable `adj` is now a list of `n + 1` lists, where each list at index `a` and `b` (for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values, respectively.
- The variable `i` is now `n - 1`.
- The variable `L` remains the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`.
- The variable `R` remains `L + 1`.
- The variable `numCuts` remains the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`.
- The variables `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers read during the loop.
