Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001), then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Given the initial conditions, if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001), then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, making `x` equal to `(50001 + 100001) // 2 = 75001`. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, making `x` equal to `(1 + 50001) // 2 = 25001`. Since the initial state specifies the condition for `L` and `R`, and the code snippet only updates `x`, the output state reflects this update.
