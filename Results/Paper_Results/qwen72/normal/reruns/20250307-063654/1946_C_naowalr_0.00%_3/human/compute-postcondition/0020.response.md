The only variables in the loop head are `L` and `R`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `R - L > 1`. Right before the loop, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001. The difference `R - L` is 100000, which is greater than 1, so the loop can certainly execute the first time. No adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
