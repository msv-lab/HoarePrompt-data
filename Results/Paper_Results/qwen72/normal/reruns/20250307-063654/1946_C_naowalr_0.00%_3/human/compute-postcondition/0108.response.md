The only variables in the loop head are `R` and `L`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `R - L` is greater than 1. Right before the loop, `R - L <= 1` is no longer valid, which means `R - L` is already greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, and `R - L > 1`**
