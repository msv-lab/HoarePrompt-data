The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop will execute because `range(n - 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n - 2`. The variable `i` is already set to `n - 2`, but for the loop to start, `i` should be 0.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should be 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 0, `L` is the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`**
