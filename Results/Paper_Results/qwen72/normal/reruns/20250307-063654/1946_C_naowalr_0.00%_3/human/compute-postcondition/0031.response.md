Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is unchanged for all variables except `numCuts`.
- `numCuts` is assigned the value 0.
- Since `numCuts` is now 0, the conditions for setting `L` and `R` are evaluated:
  - `numCuts` is not greater than `k`.
  - `numCuts` is not equal to `k` and `leftover` is not greater than or equal to 50001.
- Therefore, `L` is set to 1 and `R` is set to 50001.
