Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`, and `R - L <= 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj[a].append(b)
    adj[b].append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`, and `R - L <= 1`. `adj[a]` now contains the integer `b`, and `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`, and `R - L <= 1`. `adj[a]` now contains the integer `b` twice, and `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a` twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`, and `R - L <= 1`. `adj[a]` now contains the integer `b` three times, and `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a` three times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
