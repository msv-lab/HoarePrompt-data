Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers, `x` is the result of `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, and `R - L > 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = (L + R) // 2` updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
