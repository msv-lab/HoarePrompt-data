Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`.**

The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided, but the other variables remain unchanged. The new values of `n` and `k` are still integers, with `n` being greater than 1.
