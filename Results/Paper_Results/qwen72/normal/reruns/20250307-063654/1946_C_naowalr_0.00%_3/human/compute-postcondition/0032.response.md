Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001.**

The code snippet `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call to the variable `leftover`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `leftover` depends on the implementation of the `dfs` function, but it is now the result of that function call.
