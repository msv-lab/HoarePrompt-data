Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` adds the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `adj[a]` already contains `[b]`, after the execution, `adj[a]` will contain `[b, b]`. The other variables and the structure of `adj` remain unchanged.
