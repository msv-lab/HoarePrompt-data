Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`, and `R - L <= 1`. `adj[a]` now contains the integer `b`, and `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a`.**

The code snippet `a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin`, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The initial state already specifies that `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, so this code does not change the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
