Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.**
