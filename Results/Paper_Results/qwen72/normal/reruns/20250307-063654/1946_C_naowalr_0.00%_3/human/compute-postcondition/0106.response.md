Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, and `R - L <= 1` is no longer valid.**

Explanation:
- The value of `R` is updated to `100001` after the execution of the code.
- The condition `R - L <= 1` is no longer valid because `R` is now `100001` and `L` is `1`, making the difference `100000`, which is greater than `1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
