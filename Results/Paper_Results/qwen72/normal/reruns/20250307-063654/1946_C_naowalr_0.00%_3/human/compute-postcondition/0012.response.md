The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `n` must still be greater than 1, ensuring that `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`**
