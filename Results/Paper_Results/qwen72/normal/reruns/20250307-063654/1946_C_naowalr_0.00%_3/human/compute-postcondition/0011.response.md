Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`.
- Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[a]`.
- After the execution, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
