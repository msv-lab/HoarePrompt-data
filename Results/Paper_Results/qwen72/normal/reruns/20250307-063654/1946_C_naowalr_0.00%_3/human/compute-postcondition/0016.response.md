Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`z`**: Remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Is an input integer greater than 1, which is required for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`k`**: Remains an input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`adj`**: Initially, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists. After the loop completes, each list at index `a` and `b` in `adj` will contain the integers that are adjacent to `a` and `b`, respectively. This means that for each pair of integers `(a, b)` read from the input, `a` is added to the list at index `b` and `b` is added to the list at index `a`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 2`, since the loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive).
