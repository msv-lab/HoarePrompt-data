Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are now assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`, and `R - L <= 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variable `numCuts` will hold the final number of cuts made by the algorithm. The variable `L` will be the largest value such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to `k` and the leftover is less than `L`. The variable `R` will be the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`. The loop will terminate when the difference between `R` and `L` is less than or equal to 1.
