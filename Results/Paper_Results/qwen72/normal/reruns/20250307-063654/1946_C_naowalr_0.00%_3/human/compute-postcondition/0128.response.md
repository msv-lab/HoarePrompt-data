Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R - L > 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the integer result of `(L + R) // 2`, `L` is now equal to `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `L` is updated to be equal to `x`.
- `x` is the integer result of `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
