Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, and `R - L <= 1` is no longer valid.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, if `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than 50001, and `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001. In all cases, `R - L > 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R - L > 1`, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` > `k` or (`numCuts` == `k` and `leftover` >= `x`), then `L` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is set to `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R - L > 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is the integer result of `(L + R) // 2`. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is updated to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is updated to `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
