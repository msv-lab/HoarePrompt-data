Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b, b, b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a, a, a]`, `i` is 2, `L` is the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`, `a` and `b` are now assigned new input integer values.**

Explanation:
- The value of `adj[b]` is updated by appending `a` to it, so `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a, a]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
