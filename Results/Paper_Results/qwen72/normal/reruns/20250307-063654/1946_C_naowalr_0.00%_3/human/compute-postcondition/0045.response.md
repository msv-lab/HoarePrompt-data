The only variables in the loop head are `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `z` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and `z` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is the maximum integer such that the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a leftover value of at least `L`**
