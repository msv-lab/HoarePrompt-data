Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the expression `(1 + 100001) // 2` evaluates to 50001. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
