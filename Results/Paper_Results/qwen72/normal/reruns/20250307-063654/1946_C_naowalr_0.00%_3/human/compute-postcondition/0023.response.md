Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains the integers that are adjacent to the corresponding index, `i` is `n - 2`, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.**

Explanation:
- The `dfs(1, 1)` function call is executed, and its result is assigned to the variable `leftover`.
- The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `leftover` depends on the implementation of the `dfs` function, which is not provided. Therefore, the output state includes `leftover` as the result of the function call.
