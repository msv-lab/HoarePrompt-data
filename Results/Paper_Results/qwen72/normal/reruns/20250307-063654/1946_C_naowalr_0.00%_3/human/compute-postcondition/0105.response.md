Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the integers `b` and `a` respectively, repeated `n-1` times. `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are assigned the last pair of input integers, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts made, `L` is 1, `R` is the smallest value such that the number of cuts is less than `k` or the leftover is greater than or equal to `R`, and `R - L <= 1`.**
