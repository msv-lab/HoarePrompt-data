Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a, a]`**

The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`, which initially contains `[a, a]`. After the execution, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a, a]`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
