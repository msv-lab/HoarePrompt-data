The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 <= a, b <= n.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, a non-negative integer `k` such that 1 <= k < n, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b (1 <= a, b <= n). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.**
