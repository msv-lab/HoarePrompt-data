Postcondition: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `g[1]` must have at least one element, `stack` is a list containing a single tuple `(1, 1)`, `visited` is a set containing the integer `1`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `(1)` and the value `1`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `x` is in the `visited` set. The current value of `node` is not equal to `p`.**
