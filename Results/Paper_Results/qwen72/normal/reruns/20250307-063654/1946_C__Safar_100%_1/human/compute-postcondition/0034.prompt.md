You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 <= a, b <= n.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that contains all the edges of the tree, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that contains all the edges of the tree, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge, `c` is 0, `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l)` is true, and `r` is `l - 1`.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: - The `print(r)` statement will print the value of `r`, which is `l - 1`.
    #   - Without the exact definition of the `check` function, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `l`, but we know that `r` is one less than the smallest integer `l` that makes `check(l)` true.
    #
    #Therefore, the output will be:
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, a non-negative integer `k` such that 1 <= k < n, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b (1 <= a, b <= n). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
