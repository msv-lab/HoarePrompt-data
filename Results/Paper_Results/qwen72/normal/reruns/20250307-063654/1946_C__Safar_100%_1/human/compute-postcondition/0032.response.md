Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k < n\).
   - `edges` is a list of tuples that contains all the edges of the tree.
   - `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l)` is true.
   - `r` is `l - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(r)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `r` is defined as `l - 1`.
   - `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l)` is true. This means `l` is the smallest integer that satisfies some condition defined by the function `check`.
   - Since `r` is `l - 1`, `r` will be the integer immediately preceding `l`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(r)` statement will print the value of `r`, which is `l - 1`.
   - Without the exact definition of the `check` function, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `l`, but we know that `r` is one less than the smallest integer `l` that makes `check(l)` true.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **r (where r is l - 1 and l is the smallest integer such that check(l) is true)**
