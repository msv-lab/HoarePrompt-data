Since the `while` loop statement is `while True:`, it means the loop condition is always true and does not depend on any variables or states. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, stack is a list containing a single tuple (1, 1), visited is an empty set, d is a dictionary with the key (1) and the value 1, r is 0**
