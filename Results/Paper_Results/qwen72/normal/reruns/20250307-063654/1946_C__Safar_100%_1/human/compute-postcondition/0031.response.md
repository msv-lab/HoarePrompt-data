Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that contains all the edges of the tree, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge, `c` is 0, `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l)` is true, and `r` is `l - 1`.**

### Explanation:
The loop is a binary search algorithm that updates the values of `l` and `r` based on the result of the `check(mid)` function. The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. 

- If `check(mid)` is true, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, which means the search range is moved to the right.
- If `check(mid)` is false, `r` is updated to `mid - 1`, which means the search range is moved to the left.

The loop will terminate when `l` becomes greater than `r`. At this point, `l` will be the smallest integer for which `check(l)` is true, and `r` will be `l - 1` (the largest integer for which `check(r)` is false).

The variables `n`, `k`, `edges`, `g`, and `c` are not modified within the loop, so they retain their initial values.
