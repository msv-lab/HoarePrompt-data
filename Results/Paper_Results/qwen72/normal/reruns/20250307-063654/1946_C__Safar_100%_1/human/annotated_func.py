#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 <= a, b <= n.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that contains all the edges of the tree, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that contains all the edges of the tree, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge, `c` is 0, `l` is the smallest integer such that `check(l)` is true, and `r` is `l - 1`.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: - The `print(r)` statement will print the value of `r`, which is `l - 1`.
    #   - Without the exact definition of the `check` function, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `l`, but we know that `r` is one less than the smallest integer `l` that makes `check(l)` true.
    #
    #Therefore, the output will be:
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, a non-negative integer `k` such that 1 <= k < n, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b (1 <= a, b <= n). It constructs an adjacency list `g` representing the tree, and then uses a binary search to find the largest integer `r` such that `check(r)` is false, where `check` is some function that is not defined in the provided code. The function prints the value of `r` and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the adjacency list `g` is populated with the tree's edges, and `r` is the largest integer for which `check(r)` is false, with `l` being the smallest integer such that `check(l)` is true.
