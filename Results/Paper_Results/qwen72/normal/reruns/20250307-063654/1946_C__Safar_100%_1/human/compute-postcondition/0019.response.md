Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `stack` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)` and all tuples `(node, 1)` where `node` is an element in `g[1]` that is not equal to `p`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `1`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `(1)` and the value `1`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, and `p` is `1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`A`**: Remains a positive integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`g`**: The adjacency list of the tree remains unchanged.
- **`stack`**: Initially contains the tuple `(1, 1)`. For each `node` in `g[1]` that is not equal to `p`, the tuple `(node, 1)` is appended to `stack`. Therefore, after all iterations, `stack` will contain `(1, 1)` and all such tuples.
- **`visited`**: Remains a set containing the integer `1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`d`**: Remains a dictionary with the key `(1)` and the value `1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`r`**: Remains `0` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: Remains `1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`p`**: Remains `1` as it is not modified within the loop.
