Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that contains all the edges of the tree, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge, `c` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is the integer division of `n` by `k`.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    mid = l + (r - l) // 2
    if check(mid):
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        r = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that contains all the edges of the tree, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge, `c` is 0, `mid` is 1 + (r - 1) // 2, and `l` and `r` are updated based on the result of `check(mid)`: if `check(mid)` is true, `l` is set to 1 + (r - 1) // 2 + 1 and `r` remains the integer division of `n` by `k`; if `check(mid)` is false, `l` remains 1 and `r` is set to `mid - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that contains all the edges of the tree, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge, `c` is 0, `mid` is `l + (r - l) // 2`, and `l` and `r` are updated based on the result of `check(mid)` such that `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `check(mid)` is true, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples that contains all the edges of the tree, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, where each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` by an edge, `c` is 0, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `check(mid)` is true, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `mid` is recalculated as `l + (r - l) // 2`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid - 1` and `mid` is recalculated as `l + (r - l) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
