The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, a non-negative integer `k` such that 1 <= k < n, and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b (1 <= a, b <= n). It constructs an adjacency list `g` representing the tree, and then uses a binary search to find the largest integer `r` such that `check(r)` is false, where `check` is some function that is not defined in the provided code. The function prints the value of `r` and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the adjacency list `g` is populated with the tree's edges, and `r` is the largest integer for which `check(r)` is false, with `l` being the smallest integer such that `check(l)` is true.
