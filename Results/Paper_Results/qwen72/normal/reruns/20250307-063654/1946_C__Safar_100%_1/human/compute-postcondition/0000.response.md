Output State: **A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, where each key is a vertex and the value is a list of adjacent vertices, stack is a list containing a single tuple (1, 1).** 

The initial state is unchanged except that the variable `stack` is now a list containing a single tuple `(1, 1)`.
