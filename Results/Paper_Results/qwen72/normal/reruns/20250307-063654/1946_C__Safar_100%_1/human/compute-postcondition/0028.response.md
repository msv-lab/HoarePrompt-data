Postcondition: **A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, stack is a list containing a single tuple (1, 1), visited is a set containing the integer 1, p is 1, x is 1. If `d[x]` is greater than or equal to A, `r` is 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `d[x]` is less than A, `d` is a dictionary with the key (1) and the value 2, and `r` is 0.**
