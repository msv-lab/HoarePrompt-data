Output State: **The recursion limit is set to 1,000,000. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), and for each edge, `u`, `v`, and `w` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. The graph does not contain loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices, and it is guaranteed that there is at least one simple cycle in the graph.**
