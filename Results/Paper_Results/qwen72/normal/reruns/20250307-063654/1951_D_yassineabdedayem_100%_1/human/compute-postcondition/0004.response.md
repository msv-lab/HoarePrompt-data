The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively. It also states that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
