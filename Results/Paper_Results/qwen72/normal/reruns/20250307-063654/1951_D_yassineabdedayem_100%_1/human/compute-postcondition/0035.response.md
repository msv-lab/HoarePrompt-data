Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 999\).
- `n` and `k` are the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively.
- If `n` is equal to `k`, the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 â‰¤ k * 2` holds true.
- `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the integer `2`.
- The initial state provides conditions and relationships between `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the value being printed by the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
