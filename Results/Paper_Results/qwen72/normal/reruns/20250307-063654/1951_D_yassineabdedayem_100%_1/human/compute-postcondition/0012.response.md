The given `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`. The precondition provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **1**
