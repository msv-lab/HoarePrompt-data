The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the conditions and values of the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement itself. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **YES**
