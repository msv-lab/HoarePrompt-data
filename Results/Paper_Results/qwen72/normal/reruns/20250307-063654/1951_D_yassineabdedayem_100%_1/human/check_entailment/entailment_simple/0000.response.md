Reasoning: 

The program is designed to solve the problem of setting up stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels with her \( n \) coins. Let's break down the logic and reasoning behind the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **If \( n == k \)**:
     - If Alice has exactly \( k \) coins, she can buy exactly \( k \) jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This is a straightforward case, and the program correctly prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls (1) and the price (1).
   - **If \( n + 2 > k * 2 \)**:
     - This condition checks if Alice can buy \( k \) jewels with the remaining coins being less than 2. If this condition is true, it means Alice can buy \( k \) jewels by setting up two stalls: one with a price of \( n - k + 1 \) and another with a price of 1. The first stall will be priced such that Alice can buy exactly \( k - 1 \) jewels, and the second stall will be priced at 1 coin per jewel, allowing Alice to buy the last jewel with the remaining coins.
   - **Otherwise**:
     - If neither of the above conditions is true, it means it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. The program correctly prints "NO".

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices if the conditions are met.
   - It prints "NO" if the conditions are not met.

Let's verify the conditions:

- **Case 1: \( n == k \)**:
  - If Alice has exactly \( k \) coins, she can buy \( k \) jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
  - Example: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 7 \). Alice can buy 7 jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin each.
  - Output: "YES\n1\n1" (Correct)

- **Case 2: \( n + 2 > k * 2 \)**:
  - This condition ensures that \( n \) is at least \( 2k - 2 \). If this is true, Alice can buy \( k \) jewels by setting up two stalls: one with a price of \( n - k + 1 \) and another with a price of 1.
  - Example: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 3 \). Alice can buy 3 jewels by setting up two stalls: one priced at 5 coins (7 - 3 + 1) and another priced at 1 coin.
  - Output: "YES\n2\n5 1" (Correct)

- **Case 3: \( n + 2 \le k * 2 \)**:
  - If \( n + 2 \le k * 2 \), it means Alice does not have enough coins to buy \( k \) jewels even if she buys from the cheapest stalls.
  - Example: \( n = 6 \), \( k = 4 \). Alice cannot buy 4 jewels because even if she buys from the cheapest stalls, she would need at least 4 coins to buy 4 jewels, but she only has 6 coins.
  - Output: "NO" (Correct)

The program handles all the cases correctly and provides the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
