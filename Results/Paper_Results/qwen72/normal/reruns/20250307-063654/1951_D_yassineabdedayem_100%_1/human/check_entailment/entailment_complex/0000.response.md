Reasoning:

The program aims to determine whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices so that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels using her \( n \) coins. The program checks two main conditions to decide if it's possible:

1. **If \( n \) is equal to \( k \)**:
   - In this case, Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This is correct because \( n \) coins can buy \( n \) jewels at 1 coin each, and \( n = k \). The output is "YES", followed by 1 (the number of stalls) and 1 (the price of the stall).

2. **If \( n + 2 \) is greater than \( k \times 2 \)**:
   - This condition simplifies to \( n > 2k - 2 \). If this condition is true, Bob can set up two stalls: one with price \( n - k + 1 \) and one with price 1. Alice will buy \( k - 1 \) jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling \( k \) jewels. This is correct because:
     - \( (k - 1) \times (n - k + 1) + 1 \times 1 = (k - 1) \times (n - k + 1) + 1 \leq n \).
     - The total number of jewels bought is \( k - 1 + 1 = k \).

3. **If neither of the above conditions is true**:
   - The program prints "NO". This is correct because if \( n \leq 2k - 2 \), it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. This is because even if Bob sets up the cheapest possible stalls (all priced at 1 coin), Alice would need at least \( k \) coins to buy \( k \) jewels, and the remaining coins would not be enough to buy additional jewels to reach \( k \).

The program correctly handles the constraints and conditions given in the problem. It ensures that the number of stalls is at most 60 and the prices are within the specified range. The logic is sound and the outputs are consistent with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
