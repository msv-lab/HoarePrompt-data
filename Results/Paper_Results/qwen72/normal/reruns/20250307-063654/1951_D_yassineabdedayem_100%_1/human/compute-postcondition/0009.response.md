Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively.
- The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` is satisfied, meaning that `n + 2` is greater than `2 * k`.

Given this information, the `print` statement will always execute and print the string 'YES' because the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` is explicitly stated to be true.

Output: **YES**
