The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state describes the conditions and values of the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the `print` statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **YES**
