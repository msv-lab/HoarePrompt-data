Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` and `k` are now the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively. If `n` is equal to `k`, the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 ≤ k * 2` holds true. `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.**
