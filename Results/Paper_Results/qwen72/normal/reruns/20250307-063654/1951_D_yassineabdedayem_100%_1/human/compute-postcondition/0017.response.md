The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop can execute one more time if `t` is greater than the current number of iterations completed. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

Given that `_` is not explicitly tracked in the state, we can infer that the loop has executed once if we are considering the state at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively. If `n` is equal to `k`, the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds true. If `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 ≤ k * 2` holds true. `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.**
