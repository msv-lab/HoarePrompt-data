### Reasoning:

1. **Case \( n = k \):**
   - The program correctly handles this case by setting up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - Alice will buy exactly \( k \) jewels from this stall, which is correct.

2. **Case \( n + 2 > k \times 2 \):**
   - This condition can be simplified to \( n > 2k - 2 \).
   - The program sets up 2 stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.
   - Alice will buy \( k - 1 \) jewels from the first stall because \( n \) coins can buy \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor \) jewels, and \( n - k + 1 \) is chosen such that \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor = k - 1 \).
   - Alice will then buy 1 jewel from the second stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - This ensures Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels, which is correct.

3. **Case \( n + 2 \leq 2k \):**
   - This condition can be simplified to \( n \leq 2k - 2 \).
   - The program correctly identifies that it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly \( k \) jewels because even if Bob sets up the stalls with the smallest possible prices (1 coin per jewel), Alice would need at least \( k \) coins to buy \( k \) jewels, and she would have fewer than \( k \) coins left after buying \( k - 1 \) jewels.
   - Therefore, it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels, and the program correctly prints "NO".

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem. It checks the conditions and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

Final: **True**
