Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to correctly handle cases where `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is significantly larger than `k`. Specifically, the program only considers two scenarios: when `n == k` and when `n + 2 > k * 2`. However, there are many other cases where it is possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, but the program incorrectly outputs "NO".

For example, consider the case where `n = 100` and `k = 50`. According to the problem description, Bob can set up 50 stalls, each with a price of 2 coins. Alice will buy 1 jewel from each of the first 50 stalls, spending a total of 100 coins and buying exactly 50 jewels. However, the program will output "NO" for this case, which is incorrect.

```python
n = 100
k = 50
# Expected output:
# YES
# 50
# 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
# Actual output:
# NO
```

This shows that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
