Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively, and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds true. Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.***
