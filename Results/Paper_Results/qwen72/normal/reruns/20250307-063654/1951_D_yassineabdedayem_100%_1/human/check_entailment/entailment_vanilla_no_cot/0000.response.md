Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Base Case (n == k)**:
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins and Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels, Bob can set up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels and be left with 0 coins.
   - The program correctly prints "YES", followed by 1 and 1.

3. **Case (n + 2 > k * 2)**:
   - This condition checks if it is possible to set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` simplifies to `n > 2 * k - 2`.
   - If this condition is true, Bob can set up two stalls:
     - The first stall with a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel. Alice will buy 1 jewel from this stall and be left with `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1` coins.
     - The second stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. Alice will buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels from this stall.
   - The program correctly prints "YES", followed by 2 and the prices `n - k + 1` and 1.

4. **Case (n + 2 <= k * 2)**:
   - If the above conditions are not met, it means it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This is because the remaining coins after buying from the first stall would not be enough to buy the required number of jewels from subsequent stalls.
   - The program correctly prints "NO".

The program handles all the given constraints and test cases correctly, ensuring that Bob can set up the stalls as required or determine that it is impossible. Therefore, the program is correct.
