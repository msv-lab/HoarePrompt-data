Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The current values of `n` and `k` satisfy the condition that `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the values and the output:

1. **`n - k + 1`**: This expression calculates the difference between `n` and `k`, and then adds 1 to the result.
2. **`end=' '`**: This parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

Since `n` and `k` are provided as input and satisfy the condition `n + 2 > k * 2`, we can determine that `n` is greater than `k * 2 - 2`. This implies that `n - k` is a positive integer or zero, and adding 1 ensures that the result is at least 1.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n - k + 1` followed by a space.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are the input integers satisfying the condition n + 2 > k * 2)**
