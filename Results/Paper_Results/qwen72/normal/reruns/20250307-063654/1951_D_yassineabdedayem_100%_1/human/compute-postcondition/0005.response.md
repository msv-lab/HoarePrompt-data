Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer provided in the input line.
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

The code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **1**
