Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively, and `n` is not equal to `k`. The current values of `n` and `k` satisfy the condition that `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`.**
