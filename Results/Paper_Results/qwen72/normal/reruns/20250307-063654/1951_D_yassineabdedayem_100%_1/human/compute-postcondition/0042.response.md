The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.

The function returns different values based on the input:
- For each test case, if `n` and `k` are within the specified range, the function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.
- If `n` or `k` are outside the specified range, the function may return an error or handle the invalid input in some way, though this is not explicitly stated.

Since the exact output is not specified, we can only infer that the function processes `n` and `k` in some way and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
