Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, if `n` was equal to `k`, 'YES' and two 1s were printed. If `n` was not equal to `k` and `n + 2` was greater than `k * 2`, 'YES' and the values `n - k + 1` and 1 were printed. If `n + 2` was less than or equal to `k * 2`, 'NO' was printed. After all iterations, `t` is 0.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed all `t` iterations, and for each test case provided, the conditions within the loop were evaluated and the appropriate output was printed. The value of `t` is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of `n` and `k` for each test case were processed according to the conditions specified in the loop.
