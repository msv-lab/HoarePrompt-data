Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins and Bob sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program then checks if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' followed by `n - k + 1` and 1. This condition ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up two stalls: one with a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel and the other with a price of 1 coin per jewel. The first stall will allow Alice to buy `k - 1` jewels, and the second stall will allow her to buy 1 more jewel, totaling `k` jewels.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because if `n + 2` is not greater than `k * 2`, it means that Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
   - When the answer is 'YES', it prints the number of stalls and the prices for those stalls as required.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `n` and `k` are equal or where `n` is just slightly more than `k` (e.g., `n = k + 1`).

5. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the number of stalls is at most 60, which is within the allowed limit.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
