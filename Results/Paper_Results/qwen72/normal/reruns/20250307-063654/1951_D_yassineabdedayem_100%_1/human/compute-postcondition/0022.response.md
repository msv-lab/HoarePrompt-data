The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the conditions and values of the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables and conditions do not influence the output of the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same string.

Output: **YES**
