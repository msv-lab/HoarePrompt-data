Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). It then checks the following conditions for each test case:
- If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by two 1s.
- If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' followed by `n - k + 1` and 1.
- If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each case. **
