Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.
   - Otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`, and:
     - If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds true.
     - If `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 ≤ k * 2` holds true.
   - `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(n - k + 1, end=' ')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output the value of the expression `n - k + 1`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - We need to consider the values of `n` and `k` based on the initial state.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n - k + 1` simplifies to `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - If `n` is not equal to `k`, we need to evaluate the condition `n + 2 > k * 2`:
     - If `n + 2 > k * 2`, then `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer.
     - If `n + 2 ≤ k * 2`, then `n - k + 1` will be a non-positive integer (0 or negative).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The output will be the value of `n - k + 1`, followed by a space.
   - The exact value of `n - k + 1` depends on the specific values of `n` and `k` provided in the input.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively)**
