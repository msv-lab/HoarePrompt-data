The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 1. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, it does not need to be adjusted. The value of `t` must be decreased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, as each iteration of the loop consumes one unit of `t`.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively. If `n` is equal to `k`, the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` or `n + 2 ≤ k * 2` holds true. `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.**
