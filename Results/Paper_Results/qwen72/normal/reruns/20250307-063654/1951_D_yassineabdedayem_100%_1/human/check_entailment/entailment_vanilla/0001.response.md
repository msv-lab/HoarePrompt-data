Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 1000), the number of test cases.
   - Each test case contains two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (1 ≤ \( n, k \) ≤ 10^18), where \( n \) is the number of coins Alice has, and \( k \) is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print "YES" if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels, otherwise print "NO".
   - If the answer is "YES", print the number of stalls \( s \) (1 ≤ \( s \) ≤ 60) and the prices \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s \) (1 ≤ \( p_i \) ≤ 10^18) for each stall.

### Program Analysis:
The program is structured as follows:
1. Read the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case:
   - Read \( n \) and \( k \).
   - Check if \( n \) equals \( k \):
     - If true, print "YES" and set up 1 stall with price 1.
   - Check if \( n + 2 > k \times 2 \):
     - If true, print "YES" and set up 2 stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.
   - Otherwise, print "NO".

### Reasoning:
1. **Case \( n = k \):**
   - If Alice has exactly \( k \) coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly \( k \) jewels, Bob can set up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - Alice will buy exactly \( k \) jewels from this stall.
   - This is correct and satisfies the condition.

2. **Case \( n + 2 > k \times 2 \):**
   - This condition can be simplified to \( n + 2 > 2k \) or \( n > 2k - 2 \).
   - If \( n > 2k - 2 \), Bob can set up 2 stalls:
     - The first stall with a price of \( n - k + 1 \) coins per jewel.
     - The second stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - Alice will buy \( k - 1 \) jewels from the first stall (since \( n - k + 1 \) is the price per jewel, and she has \( n \) coins, she can buy \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor \) jewels, which is \( k - 1 \) because \( n \) is just enough to buy \( k - 1 \) jewels at this price).
   - Alice will then buy 1 jewel from the second stall (since she has \( n - (k - 1) \times (n - k + 1) = n - (n - k + 1) + k - 1 = k \) coins left, and the price is 1 coin per jewel).
   - This ensures Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - This is correct and satisfies the condition.

3. **Case \( n + 2 \leq 2k \):**
   - If \( n + 2 \leq 2k \), it means \( n \leq 2k - 2 \).
   - In this case, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly \( k \) jewels because even if Bob sets up the stalls with the smallest possible prices (1 coin per jewel), Alice would need at least \( k \) coins to buy \( k \) jewels, and she would have fewer than \( k \) coins left after buying \( k - 1 \) jewels.
   - Therefore, it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - This is correct and satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem. It checks the conditions and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
