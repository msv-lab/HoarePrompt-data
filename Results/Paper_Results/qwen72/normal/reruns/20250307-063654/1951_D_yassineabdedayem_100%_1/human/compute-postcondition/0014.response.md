Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `n` and `k` are the first and second integers provided in the input line, respectively.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This code snippet does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
