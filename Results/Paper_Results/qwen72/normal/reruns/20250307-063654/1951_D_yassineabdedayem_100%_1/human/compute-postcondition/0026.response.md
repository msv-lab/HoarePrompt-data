The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the conditions and variables involved, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints a constant string.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` is equal to `k`.
   - If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds true.
   - If `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 ≤ k * 2` holds true.
   - `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet is `print('NO')`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **NO**
