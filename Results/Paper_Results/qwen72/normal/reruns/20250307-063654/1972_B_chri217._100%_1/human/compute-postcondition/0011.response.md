Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `cases` is a list containing the tuples `(n, s)` and the new tuple `(n, s)`, `n` is an input integer stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `s` is a new string read from the standard input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.** 

The value of `n` is updated to an integer read from the standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. The value of `s` is not directly affected by this code snippet, but it is still a new string read from the standard input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
