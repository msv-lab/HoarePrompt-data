The function `read_input` is designed to read input from stdin, where the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, followed by a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the state of each coin (facing up or down). The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases.
