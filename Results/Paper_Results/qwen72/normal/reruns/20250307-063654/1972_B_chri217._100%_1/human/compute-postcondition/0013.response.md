Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `cases` is a list containing the tuples `(n, s)` and the new tuple `(n, s)`, `n` is an input integer stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `s` is a new string read from the standard input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

The code appends a new tuple `(n, s)` to the `cases` list. The `cases` list now contains the original tuples `(n, s)` and an additional tuple `(n, s)`. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `s` are still the input integer and the new string, respectively, both stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
