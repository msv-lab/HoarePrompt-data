Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading (func_1)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It collects these test cases into a list and returns the list.

2. **Game Logic (func_2)**:
   - The function counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the string `s`.
   - It returns "YES" if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and "NO" if it is even.

The game logic is based on the following reasoning:
- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob. This ensures that Alice will always have a move available when it's her turn, and Bob will eventually be left with no moves.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice. This ensures that Bob will always have a move available when it's his turn, and Alice will eventually be left with no moves.

Given this reasoning, the provided program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
