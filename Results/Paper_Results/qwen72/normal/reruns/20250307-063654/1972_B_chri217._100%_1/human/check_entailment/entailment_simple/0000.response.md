Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_1)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`.
   - The function returns the list `cases` which contains `t` tuples, each with an integer `n` and a string `s`.

2. **Game Logic (func_2)**:
   - The function `func_2` takes a single test case `(n, s)` as input.
   - It counts the number of "U" (facing up) coins in the string `s`.
   - The function returns "YES" if the number of "U" coins is odd, and "NO" if it is even.

3. **Correctness of the Game Logic**:
   - The game's outcome is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the number of "U" coins.
   - If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice can always make the first move and ensure that the number of "U" coins remains odd after her turn. This means that Bob will always face an even number of "U" coins, and eventually, Bob will be unable to make a move, leading to Alice's win.
   - If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way that the number of "U" coins remains even. This means that Alice will eventually be unable to make a move, leading to Bob's win.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2.
   - If `n` is 1, the game ends immediately, and the player who goes first (Alice) wins if the coin is "U" (odd number of "U" coins).
   - If `n` is 2, the game ends in one move, and the player who goes first (Alice) wins if there is an odd number of "U" coins (i.e., one "U" coin).

5. **Output**:
   - The output is "YES" if Alice wins and "NO" if Bob wins, which aligns with the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of "U" coins.

Correctness: **True**
