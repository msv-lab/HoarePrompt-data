The function `func_2` accepts a list `case` where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" characters. It returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in `s` is even, and 'NO' if the number of "U" characters is odd. The function does not modify the input list `case`.
