The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and `cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D". The function returns a list `cases` where each string `s` in the tuples has been stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

Functionality: **The function returns a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` that has been stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
