### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` pairs of inputs, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s`.
   - It correctly appends each pair `(n, s)` to the list `cases`.
   - The state of the program after the function call is as expected: `cases` is a list of `t` tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`.

2. **Game Logic (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` takes a tuple `case` as input, where the first element is `n` and the second element is `s`.
   - It counts the number of "U" (facing-up) coins in the string `s`.
   - The function returns "YES" if the number of "U" coins is even, and "NO" if the number of "U" coins is odd.

3. **Correctness of the Game Logic:**
   - The game's outcome is determined by the parity (even or odd) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains even after her turn. This means that Bob will always face an odd number of facing-up coins, and eventually, Bob will be forced to remove the last facing-up coin, leaving Alice with a win.
   - Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can always ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains odd after his turn. This means that Alice will always face an even number of facing-up coins, and eventually, Alice will be forced to remove the last facing-up coin, leaving Bob with a win.
   - Therefore, the logic in `func_2` is correct for determining the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge cases correctly:
     - If there is only one coin, the game ends immediately, and the player whose turn it is loses.
     - If there are no facing-up coins, the player whose turn it is loses.
   - The function does not need to handle these edge cases explicitly because the parity check already covers them.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
