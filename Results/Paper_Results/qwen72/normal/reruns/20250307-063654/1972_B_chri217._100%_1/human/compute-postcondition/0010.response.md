The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` is 2, and `t` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `cases` is a list containing the tuples `(n, s)` and the new tuple `(n, s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string read from the standard input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
