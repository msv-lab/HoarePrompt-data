You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()

    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'

for case in cases:
    print(func_2(case))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and each (n, s) in cases is a tuple where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple `(n, s)` where `n` is an input integer and `s` is a string read from the standard input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
    return cases
    #The program returns the list `cases` which contains `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` that has been stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list where the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down).
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in the string `s` is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input and processes it into a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - This function correctly handles the input format and stores the test cases in a list, which is then returned.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The function `func_2` takes a single test case as input and determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins.
   - The key observation here is that the game is essentially a parity problem. The number of facing-up coins (`ups`) determines the outcome:
     - If `ups` is odd, Alice will always win because she can always make the first move, and the parity of the number of facing-up coins will change with each move. This means that when it's Bob's turn, the number of facing-up coins will always be even, and eventually, Bob will be left with no facing-up coins to choose from.
     - If `ups` is even, Bob will always win because after Alice's first move, the number of facing-up coins will become odd, and Bob can then always make a move that keeps the number of facing-up coins odd until Alice is left with no facing-up coins to choose from.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2:
     - If `n` is 1, the game ends immediately, and the player who goes first (Alice) wins if the coin is facing up, otherwise, she loses.
     - If `n` is 2, the game also ends quickly. If both coins are facing up, Alice can remove one and win. If only one coin is facing up, Bob can remove it and win. If no coins are facing up, Alice loses immediately.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_2` returns "YES" if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and "NO" if it is even. This aligns with the game's logic and the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and correctly processes each test case.
