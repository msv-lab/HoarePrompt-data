The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `cases` is a list containing the tuple `(n, s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string read from the standard input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
