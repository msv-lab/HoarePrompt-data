The function reads a positive integer `t` from the standard input, where `1 <= t <= 100`. It then reads `t` pairs of inputs, each consisting of a positive integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 100`) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The function returns a list `cases` containing `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of the integer `n` and the string `s` stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
