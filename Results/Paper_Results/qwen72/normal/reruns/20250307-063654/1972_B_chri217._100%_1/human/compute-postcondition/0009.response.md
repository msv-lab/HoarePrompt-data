The code appends the tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a new string read from the standard input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. The list `cases` now contains one more tuple than before. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `cases` is a list containing the tuples `(n, s)` and the new tuple `(n, s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string read from the standard input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
