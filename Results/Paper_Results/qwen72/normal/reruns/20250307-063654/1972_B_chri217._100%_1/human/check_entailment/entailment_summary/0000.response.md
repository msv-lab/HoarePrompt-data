Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The key to solving this problem is understanding the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always force a win by playing optimally. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can always force a win by playing optimally.

Let's break down the functions:

1. **func_1**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - For each test case, reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - Appends each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` to a list `cases`.
   - Returns the list `cases`.

   This function correctly reads the input and formats it as expected.

2. **func_2**:
   - Takes a test case as a tuple `(n, s)`.
   - Counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`.
   - Returns 'YES' if the count of "U" characters is even, and 'NO' if the count is odd.

   The logic in `func_2` is based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. According to the problem, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always win by playing optimally. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can always win by playing optimally.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic in `func_2`. The function returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters is even, and 'NO' if the number of "U" characters is odd. This is incorrect because the correct condition should be:
- **Alice wins if the number of "U" characters is odd**.
- **Bob wins if the number of "U" characters is even**.

This is because Alice goes first, and if there is an odd number of "U" coins, Alice can always leave an even number of "U" coins for Bob, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with no "U" coins to play with.

Given this, the current implementation of `func_2` is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
