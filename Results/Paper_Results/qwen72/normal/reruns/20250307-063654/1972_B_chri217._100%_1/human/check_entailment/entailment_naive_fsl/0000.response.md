Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` only checks the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) and determines the winner based on whether this number is odd or even. However, this approach does not consider the specific rules of the game, such as the behavior when only two or one coin is left, and the impact of removing a coin and flipping its adjacent coins.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
UUDUD
```
The program will output `YES` because there are 3 facing-up coins, which is an odd number. However, the correct output should be `YES` based on the game rules, but the program's logic does not simulate the actual game play, and thus it cannot be considered correct.

To be correct, the program should simulate the game step by step, considering the rules for removing and flipping coins, and determine the winner based on the final state of the game. The current implementation is a heuristic that does not accurately reflect the game's rules.
