Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `cases` is a list containing the tuples `(n, s)` and the new tuple `(n, s)`, `n` is an input integer stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `s` is a new string read from the standard input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

The code snippet `s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()` reads a new line from the standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace, updating the value of `s` to this new string. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
