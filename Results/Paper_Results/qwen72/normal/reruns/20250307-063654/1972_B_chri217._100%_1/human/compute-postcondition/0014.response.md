Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple `(n, s)` where `n` is an input integer and `s` is a string read from the standard input and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` must have been greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop performed.
- The loop variable `_` will have the value `t-1`, indicating the last iteration.
- The list `cases` will contain `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`. Each `n` and `s` were read from the standard input during each iteration of the loop, and `s` was stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
