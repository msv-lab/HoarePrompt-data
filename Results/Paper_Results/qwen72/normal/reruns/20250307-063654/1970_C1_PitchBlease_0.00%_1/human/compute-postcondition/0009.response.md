Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing no elements, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the integers `start` and `neighbor`, `tree[start]` must contain at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first element in `tree[start]`, and `neighbor` is not in `visited` (before the execution).**
