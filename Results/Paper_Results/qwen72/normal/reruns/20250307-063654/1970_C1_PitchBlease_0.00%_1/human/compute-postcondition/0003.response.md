Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing no elements, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.** 

The deque `queue` is now empty after the tuple `(start, 0)` was removed. The variable `current` is now equal to `start`, and `dist` is 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
