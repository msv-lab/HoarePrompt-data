The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` and `target`. Both `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in a tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The tree is represented as a dictionary or a list of lists, which serves as the adjacency list of the tree.

- **Case_1**: The function returns 0.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the distance (`dist`) associated with the node (`current`) that was most recently removed from the `queue`.
- **Case_3**: The function returns the distance (`dist`) from the first tuple that was removed from the deque `queue`.
- **Case_4**: The function returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node.

Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing node indices in a tree. It returns the distance between the `start` and `target` nodes. If the `start` node is the same as the `target` node, it returns 0. If the target node is found during the search, it returns the distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the target node is not reachable from the `start` node, it returns -1.**
