You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, and tree is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The `queue` is empty, `current` is the last node that was processed, and `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. The `visited` set contains all nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`). Otherwise, the loop terminates without returning a distance, indicating that `target` is not reachable from `start`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing node indices in a tree. It returns the distance between the `start` and `target` nodes. If the `start` node is the same as the `target` node, it returns 0. If the target node is found during the search, it returns the distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the target node is not reachable from the `start` node, it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the distance (`dist`) associated with the node (`current`) that was most recently removed from the `queue`.

Case_3: The program returns the distance (`dist`) from the first tuple that was removed from the deque `queue`.

Case_4: The program returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
