Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` in addition to its previous elements, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the integers `start` and `neighbor`.**
