The only object in the loop head is `queue`, so we can only adjust the state of `queue`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `queue` is not empty. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`. Since `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`**
