The variable in the loop head is `queue`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `queue` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `queue` must still contain at least one tuple.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target` and `queue` is not empty**
