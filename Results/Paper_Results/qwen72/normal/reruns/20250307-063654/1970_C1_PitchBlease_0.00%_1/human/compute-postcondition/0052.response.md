The only objects in the loop head are `neighbor` and `tree[current]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `tree[current]`. If `tree[current]` has at least one more neighbor, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed.
- `current` is the node from the first tuple.
- `dist` is the distance from the first tuple.
- `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor.
- `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.
- If `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, `neighbor` is now in the `visited` set, and the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been appended to the `queue`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `tree[current]` must still contain at least one more neighbor.
- `neighbor` will be the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed. `current` is the node from the first tuple, and `dist` is the distance from the first tuple. `tree[current]` must contain at least two neighbors, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.**
