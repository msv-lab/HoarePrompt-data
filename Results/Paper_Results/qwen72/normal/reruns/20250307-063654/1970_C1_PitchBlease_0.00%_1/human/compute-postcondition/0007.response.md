The only objects in the loop head are `neighbor`, `tree`, and `current`. For the loop to execute, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element. Given the initial state, `current` is equal to `start`, and `start` is an integer representing a node index in the tree. The `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `tree[start]` must contain at least one neighbor.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing no elements, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`, `tree[start]` must contain at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first element in `tree[start]`**
