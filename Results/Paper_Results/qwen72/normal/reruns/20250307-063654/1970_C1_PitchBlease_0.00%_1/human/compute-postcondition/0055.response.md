Postcondition: ***`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed. `current` is the node from the first tuple, and `dist` is the distance from the first tuple. `tree[current]` must contain at least two neighbors, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been appended to `queue` and `visited` now includes `neighbor`. Otherwise, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged.***
