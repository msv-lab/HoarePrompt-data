#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge between nodes u and v in the tree, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples that has been fully iterated over, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where for each tuple (u, v) in `edges`, `u` is appended to `tree[v]` and `v` is appended to `tree[u]`.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges between nodes in a tree), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n). It constructs a tree from the edges and identifies the leaves of the tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first and second leaves. If the distance from the `start` node to either of the first two leaves is even, the function returns 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, and tree is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The `queue` is empty, `current` is the last node that was processed, and `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. The `visited` set contains all nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`). Otherwise, the loop terminates without returning a distance, indicating that `target` is not reachable from `start`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing node indices in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `start` node is the same as the `target` node, it returns 0. If the `target` node is found during the search, it returns the distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node, it returns -1.
