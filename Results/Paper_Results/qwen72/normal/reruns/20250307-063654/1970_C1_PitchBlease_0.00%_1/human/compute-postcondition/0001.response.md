Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.** 

The `visited` set now includes the integer `start`, indicating that the node `start` has been visited. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
