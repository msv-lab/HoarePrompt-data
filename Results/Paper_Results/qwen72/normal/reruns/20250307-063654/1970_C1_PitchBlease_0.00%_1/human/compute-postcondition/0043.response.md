The only objects in the loop head are `neighbor` and `tree[current]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `tree[current]`. If `tree[current]` contains at least one neighbor, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `current` is a node from the first tuple in the deque `queue`, and `queue` is not empty if `current` is not equal to `target`.

For the loop to execute, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor. The `neighbor` variable will take on the value of each element in `tree[current]` during the loop iterations.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed. `current` is the node from the first tuple, and `dist` is the distance from the first tuple. `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is the first neighbor in `tree[current]`.**
