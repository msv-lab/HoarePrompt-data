Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `queue` will contain tuples representing the unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from the `start` node to the `target` node, each tuple containing the neighbor node and the distance from the `start` node. The `current` variable remains equal to `start`, and `dist` is still 0, as these variables are not modified within the loop. The `visited` set will include all the nodes that have been visited during the traversal from the `start` node to the `target` node. The `start` and `target` variables and the `tree` structure remain unchanged.
