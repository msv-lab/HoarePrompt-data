Postcondition: ***`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`. `current` is the first element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`, and `dist` is the second element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`. `tree[current]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor. `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, it is now included, and `queue` includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor in `tree[current]`, if it exists.***
