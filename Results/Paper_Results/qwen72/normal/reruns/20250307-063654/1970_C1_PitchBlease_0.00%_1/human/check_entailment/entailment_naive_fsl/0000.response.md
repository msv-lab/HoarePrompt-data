Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the tree is a straight line and the starting node is one of the leaves. In such a case, the player who starts (Ron) will always lose because there is no other node to move the stone to. However, the program returns 'Ron' when the starting node is a leaf, which is incorrect.

Example of incorrect behavior:
- Input:
  ```
  5 1
  1 2
  2 3
  3 4
  4 5
  1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  Hermione
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  Ron
  ```
