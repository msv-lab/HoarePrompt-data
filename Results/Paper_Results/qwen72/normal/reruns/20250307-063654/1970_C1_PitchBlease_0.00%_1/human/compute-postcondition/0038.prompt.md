Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, except the first tuple which has been removed; `current` is the first element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`; `dist` is the second element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`; `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`) associated with the node (`current`). Otherwise, the program continues with the updated state.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, and if `neighbor` is not in `visited`, an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`. `current` is the first element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`, and `dist` is the second element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`. `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor. `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`, and if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `neighbor` is now included in `visited`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`, and `neighbor` is included in `visited`. `current` is the first element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`, and `dist` is the second element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`. `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor. `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`, and if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now included. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor in `tree[current]`, if it exists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`. `current` is the first element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`, and `dist` is the second element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`. `tree[current]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor. `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, it is now included, and `queue` includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor in `tree[current]`, if it exists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
