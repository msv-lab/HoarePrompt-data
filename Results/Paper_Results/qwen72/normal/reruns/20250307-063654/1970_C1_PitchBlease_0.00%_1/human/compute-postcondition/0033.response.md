Postcondition: ***`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`, and `neighbor` is included in `visited`. `current` is the first element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`, and `dist` is the second element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`. `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, and `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor. `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`, and if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now included. `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor in `tree[current]`, if it exists.***
