Postcondition: ***`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, except the first tuple which has been removed; `current` is the first element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`; `dist` is the second element of the tuple that was removed from `queue`; `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree; `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`) associated with the node (`current`). Otherwise, the program continues with the updated state.***
