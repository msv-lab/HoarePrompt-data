Postcondition: ***`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed. `current` is the node from the first tuple, and `dist` is the distance from the first tuple. `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is the first neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`, and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set.***
