Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`. `current` is the first element of the last tuple that was removed from `queue`, and `dist` is the second element of the last tuple that was removed from `queue`. `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`) associated with the node (`current`). Otherwise, the loop continues until all nodes in the path from `start` to `target` have been visited, and `queue` is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed. `current` is the node from the first tuple, and `dist` is the distance from the first tuple. All neighbors of `current` that are not in `visited` have been added to `visited` and appended to `queue` with their respective distances (`dist + 1`). If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`) from the first tuple that was removed from the deque `queue`. Otherwise, `queue` is not empty and the program continues execution.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
