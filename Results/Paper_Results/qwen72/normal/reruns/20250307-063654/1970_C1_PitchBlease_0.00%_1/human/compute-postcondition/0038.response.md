Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`. `current` is the first element of the last tuple that was removed from `queue`, and `dist` is the second element of the last tuple that was removed from `queue`. `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`) associated with the node (`current`). Otherwise, the loop continues until all nodes in the path from `start` to `target` have been visited, and `queue` is empty.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `queue` will contain tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`.
- The `current` variable will hold the node index of the last node that was removed from the `queue`.
- The `dist` variable will hold the distance of the last node that was removed from the `queue`.
- The `visited` set will contain all nodes that have been visited in the path from `start` to `target`.
- If the `current` node is the `target` node, the program will return the distance `dist` associated with this node.
- If the `current` node is not the `target` node, the loop will continue until all nodes in the path from `start` to `target` have been visited, and the `queue` will be empty.
