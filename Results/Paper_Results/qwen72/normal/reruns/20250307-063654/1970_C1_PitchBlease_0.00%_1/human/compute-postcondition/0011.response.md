Postcondition: ***`queue` is a deque, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains one element `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` contains the integers `start` and `neighbor`.***
