Output State: **The `queue` is empty, `current` is the last node that was processed, and `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. The `visited` set contains all nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`). Otherwise, the loop terminates without returning a distance, indicating that `target` is not reachable from `start`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The `queue` is now empty because all nodes have been processed.
- `current` holds the value of the last node that was processed by the loop.
- `dist` holds the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node.
- The `visited` set contains all the nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop.
- If the `current` node is the `target` node, the program returns the distance (`dist`) from the `start` node to the `target` node.
- If the `current` node is not the `target` node, the loop terminates without returning a distance, indicating that the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node.
