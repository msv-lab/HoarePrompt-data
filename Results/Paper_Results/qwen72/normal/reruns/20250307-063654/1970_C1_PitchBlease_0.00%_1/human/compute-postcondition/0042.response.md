Postcondition: ***`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed. `current` is the node from the first tuple, and `dist` is the distance from the first tuple. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`) from the first tuple that was removed from the deque `queue`. Otherwise, `queue` is not empty and the program continues execution.***
