The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges between nodes in a tree), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n). It constructs a tree from the edges and identifies the leaves of the tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first and second leaves. If the distance from the `start` node to either of the first two leaves is even, the function returns 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.
