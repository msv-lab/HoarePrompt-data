The only objects in the loop head are `neighbor` and `tree[current]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list of neighbors in `tree[current]`. If `tree[current]` has at least one more neighbor, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is the first neighbor in `tree[current]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` will be the next neighbor in the list.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed. `current` is the node from the first tuple, and `dist` is the distance from the first tuple. `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`, and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set.**
