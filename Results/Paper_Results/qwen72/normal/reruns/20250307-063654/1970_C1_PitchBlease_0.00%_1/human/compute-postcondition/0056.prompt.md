Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed. `current` is the node from the first tuple, and `dist` is the distance from the first tuple. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance (`dist`) from the first tuple that was removed from the deque `queue`. Otherwise, `queue` is not empty and the program continues execution.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed. `current` is the node from the first tuple, and `dist` is the distance from the first tuple. `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is the first neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`, and `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed. `current` is the node from the first tuple, and `dist` is the distance from the first tuple. `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, `neighbor` is now in the `visited` set, and the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been appended to the `queue`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(node, distance)` for all unvisited neighbors of the nodes in the path from `start` to `target`, but the first tuple has been removed. `current` is the node from the first tuple, and `dist` is the distance from the first tuple. `tree[current]` must contain at least two neighbors, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been appended to `queue` and `visited` now includes `neighbor`. Otherwise, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
