The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a certain number of times, and it doesn't need to be initialized before the loop starts. However, the input must be a valid integer for the loop to start.

State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0**
