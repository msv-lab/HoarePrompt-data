Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `a` must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element of `a`, `res` is 1, `count` is a dictionary with a single entry where the key is `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` and the value is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
