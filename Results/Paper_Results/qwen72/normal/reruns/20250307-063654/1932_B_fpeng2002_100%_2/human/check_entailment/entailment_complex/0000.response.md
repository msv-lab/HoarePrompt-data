### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The function initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that the year is strictly greater than the previous year.
   - The formula `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - The function also handles the case where all periodicities are 1 correctly, as it will always find the next year to be the smallest multiple greater than the previous year.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
     - Start year: 0
     - First sign: 3 (0 + 3)
     - Second sign: 4 (3 + 1 = 4)
     - Third sign: 8 (4 + 4)
     - Fourth sign: 10 (8 + 2 = 10)
     - Fifth sign: 18 (10 + 8 = 18)
     - Sixth sign: 36 (18 + 18 = 36)
   - For the second test case with `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
     - Start year: 0
     - First sign: 1 (0 + 1)
     - Second sign: 2 (1 + 1 = 2)
     - Third sign: 3 (2 + 1 = 3)
     - Fourth sign: 4 (3 + 1 = 4)
     - Fifth sign: 5 (4 + 1 = 5)
   - For the third test case with `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`:
     - Start year: 0
     - First sign: 1 (0 + 1)
     - Second sign: 2 (1 + 1 = 2)
     - Third sign: 3 (2 + 1 = 3)
     - Fourth sign: 4 (3 + 1 = 4)
     - Fifth sign: 5 (4 + 1 = 5)
   - For the fourth test case with `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`:
     - Start year: 0
     - First sign: 50 (0 + 50)
     - Second sign: 60 (50 + 10 = 60)
     - Third sign: 1422 (60 + 1362 = 1422)
     - Fourth sign: 1600 (1422 + 178 = 1600)
     - Fifth sign: 2012 (1600 + 412 = 2012)
     - Sixth sign: 2012 (2012 + 0 = 2012)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program.

Correctness: **True**
