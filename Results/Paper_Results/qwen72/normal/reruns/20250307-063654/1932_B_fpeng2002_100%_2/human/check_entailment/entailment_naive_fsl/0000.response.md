Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the sequential occurrence rule described in the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.
3. **Calculating the Year**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur strictly after the previous sign has occurred.
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

This logic correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The program also handles edge cases such as when all signs have a periodicity of 1, and when the periodicities are large numbers within the given constraints.

Thus, the program is correct for every potential case.
