Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `start_year` is 0, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `start_year` was `(start_year // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`, but after the code `start_year = 0` is executed, `start_year` is now 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num_tests`, `nums`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
