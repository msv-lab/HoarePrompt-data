Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is two less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `start_year` is 0, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `start_year = 0` explicitly sets the value of `start_year` to 0.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num_tests`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
