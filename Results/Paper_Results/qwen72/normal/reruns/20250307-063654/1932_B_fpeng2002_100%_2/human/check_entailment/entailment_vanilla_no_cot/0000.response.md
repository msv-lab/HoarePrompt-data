Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0, which is the starting point for calculating the year of the first sign.
3. **Loop Through Signs**: The program iterates through the list of periodicities (`nums`), updating `start_year` for each sign.
4. **Update Start Year**: The expression `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. This is done by:
   - Dividing `start_year` by the current periodicity `nums[x]` and taking the integer part to find the last multiple of `nums[x]` that is less than or equal to `start_year`.
   - Adding 1 to move to the next multiple.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next occurrence.

This approach correctly calculates the year in which each sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, and finally prints the year of the last sign.

The program handles the constraints and examples provided correctly, so it can be considered correct.
