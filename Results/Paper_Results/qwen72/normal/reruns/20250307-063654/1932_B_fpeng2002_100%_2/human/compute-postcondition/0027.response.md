The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `len(nums)` elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the product of all elements in `nums` that is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**
