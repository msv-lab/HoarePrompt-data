You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is 0, `nums` is the last list of integers input by the user that must have at least `len(nums)` elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the original `start_year`, and this `start_year` is the result of applying the same logic for each element in `nums` sequentially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of test cases from user input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It then calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of each integer in the list, starting from 0, and prints this year. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `num_tests` set to 0. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the sequential occurrence rule described in the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.
3. **Calculating the Year**:
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur strictly after the previous sign has occurred.
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

This logic correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The program also handles edge cases such as when all signs have a periodicity of 1, and when the periodicities are large numbers within the given constraints.

Thus, the program is correct for every potential case.
