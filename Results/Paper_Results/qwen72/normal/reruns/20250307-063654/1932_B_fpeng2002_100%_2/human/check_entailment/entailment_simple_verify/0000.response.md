Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the sequential occurrence rule described in the problem. Let's break down the program and the annotations to verify this claim:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one using a while loop. This is correct and ensures that all test cases are handled.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`. This is also correct and follows the input format specified in the problem description.

3. **Calculating the Year**:
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur strictly after the previous sign has occurred using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - This formula ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

Let's analyze the formula in detail:
- `start_year // nums[x]` gives the quotient when `start_year` is divided by `nums[x]`.
- `start_year // nums[x] + 1` increments the quotient by 1 to ensure the next multiple.
- `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` multiplies the incremented quotient by `nums[x]` to get the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

This logic is correct and ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The program correctly handles edge cases such as when all signs have a periodicity of 1, and when the periodicities are large numbers within the given constraints.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final `start_year` for each test case, which is the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

Given the annotations and the problem description, the program's logic aligns perfectly with the requirements. The annotations confirm that the state of the program is maintained correctly throughout the execution, and the final `start_year` is indeed the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the original `start_year` after applying the logic for each element in `nums` sequentially.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
