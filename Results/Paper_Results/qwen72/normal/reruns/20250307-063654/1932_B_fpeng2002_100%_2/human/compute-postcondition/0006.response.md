The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t`, `n`, `a`, `num_tests`, and `start_year` do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least 1 element, and `x` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is a positive integer that is now one less than its initial value, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is 0, `x` is 0**
