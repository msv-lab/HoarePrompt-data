Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is a positive integer that is now one less than its initial value.**

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables `t`, `a`, and `num_tests` remain unchanged, except that `num_tests` is now one less than its initial value.
