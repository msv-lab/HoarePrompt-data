Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is 0, `nums` is the last list of integers input by the user that must have at least `len(nums)` elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the original `start_year`, and this `start_year` is the result of applying the same logic for each element in `nums` sequentially.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- The variable `n` is the last input integer provided by the user.
- The variable `a` remains a list of `n` positive integers, each within the range 1 to 10^6.
- The variable `num_tests` is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `nums` is the last list of integers input by the user, and it must have at least `len(nums)` elements.
- The variable `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the original `start_year`, and this `start_year` is the result of applying the same logic for each element in `nums` sequentially. This means that `start_year` has been updated to the smallest multiple of each element in the list `nums` in the order they were processed, starting from 0.
