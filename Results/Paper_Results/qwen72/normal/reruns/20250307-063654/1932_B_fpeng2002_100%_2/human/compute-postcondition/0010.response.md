The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `x` is 1.
- `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` is now 2.
- `nums` must still have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is a positive integer that is now one less than its initial value, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is now `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 2**
