Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicities of the signs. The key operation in the program is the calculation of the smallest year that is a multiple of each integer in the list, starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
2. **Test Case Loop**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.
3. **Year Calculation**: The program initializes `start_year` to 0. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign by:
   - Dividing `start_year` by the current periodicity `nums[x]` and adding 1 to ensure the next multiple.
   - Multiplying the result by `nums[x]` to get the next multiple.
4. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the final `start_year`.

This logic ensures that the signs occur sequentially and that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The use of `start_year // nums[x] + 1` ensures that the next multiple is found correctly, and multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year.

Let's verify the example cases:
- For the input `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
  - Start at year 0.
  - First sign occurs at year 3.
  - Second sign occurs at year 4 (3 + 1).
  - Third sign occurs at year 8 (4 + 4).
  - Fourth sign occurs at year 10 (8 + 2).
  - Fifth sign occurs at year 18 (10 + 8).
  - Sixth sign occurs at year 36 (18 + 18).

- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
  - Start at year 0.
  - First sign occurs at year 1.
  - Second sign occurs at year 2 (1 + 1).
  - Third sign occurs at year 3 (2 + 1).
  - Fourth sign occurs at year 4 (3 + 1).
  - Fifth sign occurs at year 5 (4 + 1).

- For the input `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`:
  - Start at year 0.
  - First sign occurs at year 1.
  - Second sign occurs at year 2 (1 + 1).
  - Third sign occurs at year 3 (2 + 1).
  - Fourth sign occurs at year 4 (3 + 1).
  - Fifth sign occurs at year 5 (4 + 1).

- For the input `[50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`:
  - Start at year 0.
  - First sign occurs at year 50.
  - Second sign occurs at year 60 (50 + 10).
  - Third sign occurs at year 711 (60 + 651).
  - Fourth sign occurs at year 800 (711 + 89).
  - Fifth sign occurs at year 1006 (800 + 206).
  - Sixth sign occurs at year 2012 (1006 + 1006).

The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and computes the smallest year for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
