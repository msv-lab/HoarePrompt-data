Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is a positive integer that is now one less than its initial value, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is now `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `start_year` is updated to `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num_tests`, `nums`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
