Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is a positive integer that is now one less than its initial value, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is now `(start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, `x` is 2.** 

The value of `start_year` is updated to be the next multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the original `start_year`. Other variables remain unchanged.
