Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a series of test cases from user input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It then calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of each integer in the list, starting from 0, and prints this year. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `num_tests` set to 0. The function does not return any value. **
