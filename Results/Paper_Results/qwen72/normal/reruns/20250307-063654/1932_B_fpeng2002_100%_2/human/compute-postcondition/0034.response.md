The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `nums`. If `x` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, and `nums` must still have at least 1 element.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is two less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `x` is 1, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`**
