Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 0**

Explanation:
- `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0.
- Since `start_year` was initially 0, the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` simplifies to `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, which is `1 * nums[0]` or simply `nums[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
