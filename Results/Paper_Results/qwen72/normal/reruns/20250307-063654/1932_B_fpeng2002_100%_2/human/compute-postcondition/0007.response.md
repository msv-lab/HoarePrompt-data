Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is a positive integer that is now one less than its initial value, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is now `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, `x` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `start_year` is updated to `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. Since `start_year` was initially 0, the expression `0 // nums[0]` evaluates to 0 (integer division of 0 by any positive integer is 0). Adding 1 to this result gives 1, and multiplying by `nums[0]` gives `nums[0]`. Therefore, `start_year` is now equal to `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
