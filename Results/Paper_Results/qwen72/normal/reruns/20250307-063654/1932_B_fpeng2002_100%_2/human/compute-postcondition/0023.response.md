The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, and `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `nums` must still have at least one element, but since `x` is now 2, `nums` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the original `start_year`, `x` is 2**
