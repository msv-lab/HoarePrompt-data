The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
