Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is a positive integer that is now one less than its initial value.** 

The value of `num_tests` has been decreased by 1, but it remains a positive integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) are unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
