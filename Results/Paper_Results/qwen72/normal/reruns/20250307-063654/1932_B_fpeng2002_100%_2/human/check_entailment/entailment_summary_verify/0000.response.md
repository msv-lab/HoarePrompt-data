Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program works as expected:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `num_tests` from the input.
   - It then processes each test case in a loop until `num_tests` is reduced to 0.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n`.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

3. **Calculating the Year**:
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the starting year for the first sign.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur strictly after the previous sign has occurred.
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.

4. **Sequential Occurrence**:
   - The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs by updating `start_year` for each sign.
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`, which aligns with the problem's requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when all signs have a periodicity of 1. In this case, each sign will occur in consecutive years, and the final year will be `n`.
   - It also handles large periodicities within the given constraints (1 to 10^6).

6. **Output**:
   - After calculating the year for each test case, the program prints the result.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the `func` function. The function reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the correct year for the n-th sign to occur. The logic used in the program is sound and aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.

Final: **True**
