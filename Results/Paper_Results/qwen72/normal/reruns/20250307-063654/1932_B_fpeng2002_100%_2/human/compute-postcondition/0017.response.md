Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `start_year` is now `(start_year // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**. 

The code snippet `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]` updates the `nums` list with new integer values provided by the user, and the length of `nums` is now the number of integers input by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.
