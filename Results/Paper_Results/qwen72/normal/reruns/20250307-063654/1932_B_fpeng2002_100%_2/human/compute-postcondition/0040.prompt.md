Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, num_tests is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is a positive integer that is now one less than its initial value, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `len(nums)` elements, `start_year` is now `(start_year // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `len(nums)` elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the product of all elements in `nums` that is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is two less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `len(nums)` elements, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the original `start_year`, and this `start_year` is the result of applying the same logic for each element in `nums` sequentially.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
