The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, each between 1 and 1,000,000. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided.**
