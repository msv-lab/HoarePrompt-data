Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the original `start_year`, `x` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` updates the value of `start_year`.
- `x` is 2, so `nums[x]` is `nums[2]`.
- `start_year // nums[2]` computes the integer division of `start_year` by `nums[2]`.
- Adding 1 to the result of the integer division ensures that `start_year` is moved to the next multiple of `nums[2]`.
- Multiplying the result by `nums[2]` gives the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the original `start_year`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
