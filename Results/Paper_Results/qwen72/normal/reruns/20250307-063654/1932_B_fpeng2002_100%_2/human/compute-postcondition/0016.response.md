Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is now one less than its initial value and must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `len(nums)` elements, `start_year` is now `(start_year // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, which means it can now hold any integer value provided by the user.
- All other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged and are still valid.
