The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `times`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t`, `n`, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `check` do not directly affect the loop's execution and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` contains `n` elements where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `check` is 2147483647**
