Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` contains `n` elements where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `check` is 2147483647, `data` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first element of `data`, `s` is the result of `i ^ 2147483647`.** 

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` (the first element of `data`) and `check` (2147483647). The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
