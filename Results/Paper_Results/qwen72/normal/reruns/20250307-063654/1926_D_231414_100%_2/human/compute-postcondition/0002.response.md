The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `times`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The other variables mentioned in the state (t, n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and `check`) are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

For the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than 0.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0**
