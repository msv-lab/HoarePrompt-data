The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `data`. For the loop to execute, `data` must contain at least one integer. The variable `i` will take the value of the first integer in `data` when the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `times` must be greater than 0 (this is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer (this is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `data` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `dic` is an empty dictionary (this is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `ans` is 0 (this is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `check` is 2147483647 (this is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).

To ensure the loop can execute, `data` must have at least one integer, and `i` will be the first integer in `data`.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in `data`, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `check` is 2147483647**
