Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the string is already sorted or contains only one type of character (all '0's or all '1's). For example, for the input "0000", the program should output 0, but it incorrectly outputs 1. This is because the program increments the cost whenever it encounters a '0' after a '1', even if the string is already sorted. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
