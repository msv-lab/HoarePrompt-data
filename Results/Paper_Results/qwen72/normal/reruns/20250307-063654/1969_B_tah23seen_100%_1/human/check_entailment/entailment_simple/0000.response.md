Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.

### Explanation of the Algorithm:
1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1(s)` initializes two variables:
   - `cost` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - `one` to 0, which will count the number of '1's encountered in the string.

2. **Iteration through the String**:
   - The function iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If `i` is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
   - If `i` is '0' and there are some '1's before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This is because a '0' preceded by '1's indicates a potential cyclic shift that needs to be performed to move the '0' to the correct position.

3. **Return the Cost**:
   - After iterating through the string, the function returns the total `cost`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Handling of '1's and '0's**: The program correctly identifies the positions where '0's are preceded by '1's, which are the points where a cyclic shift is needed.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost is calculated as `one + 1` for each '0' that is preceded by at least one '1'. This is because the substring to be shifted includes all the '1's before the '0' and the '0' itself, making the length of the substring `one + 1`.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000"), the program correctly returns 0.
  - If the string is a sequence of '1's followed by '0's (e.g., "11000"), the program correctly calculates the cost by summing up the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1**: "10" -> The only '0' is preceded by one '1'. The cost is 2.
- **Example 2**: "0000" -> The string is already sorted, so the cost is 0.
- **Example 3**: "11000" -> The '0' at index 2 is preceded by two '1's, and the '0' at index 3 and 4 are also preceded by two '1's. The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
- **Example 4**: "101011" -> The '0' at index 1 is preceded by one '1', and the '0' at index 3 is preceded by two '1's. The total cost is 2 + 3 = 5.
- **Example 5**: "01101001" -> The '0' at index 1 is preceded by no '1's, the '0' at index 4 is preceded by two '1's, and the '0' at index 6 and 7 are preceded by one '1'. The total cost is 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 (not 11, so there is an issue).

### Issue Found:
- In the fifth example, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 11. The correct cost should be 7, as the '0' at index 1 is not preceded by any '1's, and the '0's at indices 4, 6, and 7 are preceded by 2, 1, and 1 '1's respectively.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where a '0' is not preceded by any '1's correctly. This leads to an overestimation of the cost in some cases.

Correctness: **False**
