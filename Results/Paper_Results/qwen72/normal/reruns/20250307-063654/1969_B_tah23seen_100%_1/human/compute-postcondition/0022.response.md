The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only 0s and 1s) with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000. The function returns the total sum of `one + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is preceded by at least one '1', where `one` is the count of '1's in the string `s` that are not followed by a '0'.
