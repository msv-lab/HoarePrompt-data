You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only 0s and 1s) with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: After all iterations, `s` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000. `one` is the count of '1's in the string `s` that are not followed by a '0'. `cost` is the total sum of `one + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is preceded by at least one '1'.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total sum of `one + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is preceded by at least one '1', where `one` is the count of '1's in the string `s` that are not followed by a '0'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`.
   - The function iterates through the string `s` and keeps track of the number of '1's encountered (`one`).
   - For each '0' encountered, if there are any '1's before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the cost. This is because to move a '0' past all the '1's, we need to perform a cyclic shift of length `one + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic of adding `one + 1` to the cost for each '0' encountered after some '1's is correct. This is because each '0' needs to be moved past all the '1's that came before it, and the cost of moving a '0' past `one` '1's is `one + 1`.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (i.e., no '0' after '1' is encountered, so `one` remains 0 and no cost is added).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost.
   - The function handles the case where the string is a mix of '0's and '1's (e.g., "101011") by correctly calculating the cost to move each '0' past the '1's that came before it.
   - The function handles the case where the string is entirely '1's (e.g., "1111") by not adding any cost, as no '0's are present.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The function iterates through the string once, making it \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the length of the string. This is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the string `s` and printing the result of `func_1(s)`.
   - The loop `while t:` correctly processes each test case and decrements `t` until all test cases are handled.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The logic is sound, and the program handles all edge cases and constraints effectively.

Correctness: **True**
