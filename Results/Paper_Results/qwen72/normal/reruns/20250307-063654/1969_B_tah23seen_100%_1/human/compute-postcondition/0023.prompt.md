You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only 0s and 1s) with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: After all iterations, `s` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000. `one` is the count of '1's in the string `s` that are not followed by a '0'. `cost` is the total sum of `one + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is preceded by at least one '1'.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total sum of `one + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is preceded by at least one '1', where `one` is the count of '1's in the string `s` that are not followed by a '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a binary string `s` and returns the total sum of `one + 1` for each '0' in the string that is preceded by at least one '1', where `one` is the count of '1's in the string that are not followed by a '0'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total sum of `one + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is preceded by at least one '1', where `one` is the count of '1's in the string `s` that are not followed by a '0'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
