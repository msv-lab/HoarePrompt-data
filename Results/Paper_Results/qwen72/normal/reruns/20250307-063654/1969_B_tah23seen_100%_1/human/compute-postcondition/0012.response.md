Output State: **`s` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000, `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is '1', `one` is 1, `cost` remains 0, and `cost` is now 1. If `i` is '0', `one` remains 0, `cost` is `one + 1` if `one` is greater than 0, otherwise `cost` remains 0, and `cost` is now 1 if `one` was greater than 0, otherwise `cost` remains 0.** 

In natural language: The initial state is that `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200,000. `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is '1', `one` was set to 1 and `cost` was 0, and now `cost` is 1. If `i` is '0', `one` was 0 and `cost` was 0 if `one` was not greater than 0, and now `cost` is 1 if `one` was greater than 0, otherwise `cost` remains 0.
