Postcondition: ***`s` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000, `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, `cost` is set to `one + 1` and `one` remains 0. If `i` is '0' and `one` is 0, `cost` remains 0 and `one` remains 0. If `i` is '1', `one` is set to 1 and `cost` remains 0.***
