Output State: **After all iterations, `s` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000. `one` is the count of '1's in the string `s` that are not followed by a '0'. `cost` is the total sum of `one + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is preceded by at least one '1'.**

In natural language, this means:
- The binary string `s` does not change.
- The variable `one` ends up being the number of '1's in `s` that do not have a '0' immediately following them.
- The variable `cost` accumulates the value of `one + 1` each time a '0' is encountered in `s` and there was at least one '1' before it. If no '1' was encountered before a '0', `cost` does not change for that '0'.
