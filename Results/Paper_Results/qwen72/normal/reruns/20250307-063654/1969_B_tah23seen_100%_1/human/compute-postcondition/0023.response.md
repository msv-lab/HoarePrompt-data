Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `s` and returns an integer `cost`. The `cost` is calculated as the total sum of `one + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is preceded by at least one '1', where `one` is the count of consecutive '1's in the string that are not immediately followed by a '0'. The original string `s` remains unchanged after the function execution. **
