### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`.
   - The function iterates through the string `s` and keeps track of the number of '1's encountered (`one`).
   - For each '0' encountered, if there are any '1's before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the cost. This is because to move a '0' past all the '1's, we need to perform a cyclic shift of length `one + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic of adding `one + 1` to the cost for each '0' encountered after some '1's is correct. This is because each '0' needs to be moved past all the '1's that came before it, and the cost of moving a '0' past `one` '1's is `one + 1`.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (i.e., no '0' after '1' is encountered, so `one` remains 0 and no cost is added).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost.
   - The function handles the case where the string is a mix of '0's and '1's (e.g., "101011") by correctly calculating the cost to move each '0' past the '1's that came before it.
   - The function handles the case where the string is entirely '1's (e.g., "1111") by not adding any cost, as no '0's are present.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The function iterates through the string once, making it \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the length of the string. This is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the string `s` and printing the result of `func_1(s)`.
   - The loop `while t:` correctly processes each test case and decrements `t` until all test cases are handled.

7. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The state annotations are correct and align with the problem description and the function's logic.
   - The final state of `one` is the count of '1's in the string `s` that are not followed by a '0'.
   - The final state of `cost` is the total sum of `one + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is preceded by at least one '1'.
   - The return value is the total cost, which is computed correctly based on the logic described.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The logic is sound, and the program handles all edge cases and constraints effectively. The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior.

Final: **True**
