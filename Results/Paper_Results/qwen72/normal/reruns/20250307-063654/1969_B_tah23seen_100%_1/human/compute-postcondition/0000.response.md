Output State: **`s` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000, `cost` is 0.** 

The initial state specifies that `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200,000. The code snippet initializes the variable `cost` to 0. Since no other operations are performed, the value of `s` remains unchanged, and `cost` is now 0.
