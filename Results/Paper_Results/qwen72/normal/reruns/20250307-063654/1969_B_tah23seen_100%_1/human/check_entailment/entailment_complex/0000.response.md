### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost.
   - A cyclic shift operation on a substring of length `r - l + 1` has a cost of `r - l + 1`.
   - The string is considered sorted if all '0's come before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Function**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string `s` and maintains two variables: `cost` and `one`.
   - `one` counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - When a '0' is encountered and `one` is greater than 0, it means there are '1's before this '0', and a cyclic shift is needed to move these '1's to the right of the '0'. The cost for this shift is `one + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the need for a cyclic shift whenever a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's.
   - The cost calculation `one + 1` is correct because it accounts for the entire substring of '1's followed by a '0', which needs to be shifted.
   - The function does not perform any operations that change the string `s`, which is consistent with the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - If the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111"), the function correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - If the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000"), the function correctly returns 0 because no shifts are needed.
   - For strings like "101011", the function correctly calculates the cost by summing up the necessary shifts.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The function iterates through the string once, making it O(n) where n is the length of the string. This is efficient and meets the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string `s` using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic and implementation are sound, and it handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
