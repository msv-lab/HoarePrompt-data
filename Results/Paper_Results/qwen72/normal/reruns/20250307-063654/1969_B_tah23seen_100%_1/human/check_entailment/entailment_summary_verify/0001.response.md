### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`.
   - The function iterates through the string `s` and keeps track of the number of '1's encountered (`one`).
   - For each '0' encountered, if there are any '1's before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the cost. This is because to move a '0' past all the '1's, we need to perform a cyclic shift of length `one + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic of adding `one + 1` to the cost for each '0' encountered after some '1's is correct. This is because each '0' needs to be moved past all the '1's that came before it, and the cost of moving a '0' past `one` '1's is `one + 1`.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the case where the string has a '0' that is not preceded by any '1's. For example, in the string "101011", the function will add `one + 1` for each '0' after the first '1', but it will not account for the '0' at the beginning of the string.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost.
   - The function handles the case where the string is a mix of '0's and '1's (e.g., "101011") by correctly calculating the cost to move each '0' past the '1's that came before it.
   - The function handles the case where the string is entirely '1's (e.g., "1111") by not adding any cost, as no '0's are present.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where the string starts with a '0' and has '1's later, such as "01101001". In this case, the function will not add the cost for the initial '0', which should be considered.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The function iterates through the string once, making it \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the length of the string. This is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the string `s` and printing the result of `func_1(s)`.
   - The loop `while t:` correctly processes each test case and decrements `t` until all test cases are handled.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is mostly correct but has a logical flaw in handling the case where the string starts with a '0' and has '1's later. This oversight can lead to incorrect cost calculations in certain scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the logical flaw in handling the initial '0' in the string. To fix this, the function should consider the cost of moving the initial '0' past any '1's that come after it.
