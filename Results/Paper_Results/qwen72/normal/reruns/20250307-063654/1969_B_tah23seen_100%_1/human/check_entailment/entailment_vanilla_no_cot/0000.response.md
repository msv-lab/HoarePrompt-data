Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` calculates the cost based on the number of '1's and '0's in the string, but it does not account for the optimal way to sort the string using cyclic shifts of substrings. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not consider the structure of the string or the optimal way to perform the shifts to achieve the sorted string with the minimum cost.

### Explanation:
- **Problem Requirement**: The goal is to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
- **Flaw in the Program**: The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the cost by simply adding the number of '1's plus one whenever it encounters a '0' after a '1'. This does not reflect the actual cost of the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following:
1. **Identify the Transition Points**: Find the points where the string transitions from '1' to '0'. These points are critical because they indicate where a cyclic shift might be necessary.
2. **Calculate the Minimum Cost**: The minimum cost to sort the string can be determined by finding the longest contiguous segment of '1's and '0's and then calculating the cost based on the number of transitions and the length of the string.

### Example:
For the string "101011":
- The transitions are at positions 1 (10), 3 (10), and 5 (10).
- The optimal way to sort this string is to perform cyclic shifts on the substrings that include these transitions.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    cost = 0
    transitions = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i-1] == '1' and s[i] == '0':
            transitions += 1
    if transitions == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n - s.count('0') + transitions - 1

t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(min_cost_to_sort(s))
    t -= 1
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`transitions`**: Counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0'.
- **`s.count('0')`**: Counts the number of '0's in the string.
- **`n - s.count('0')`**: This is the number of '1's in the string.
- **`n - s.count('0') + transitions - 1`**: This formula calculates the minimum cost to sort the string. The cost is the length of the string minus the number of '0's plus the number of transitions minus one.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
