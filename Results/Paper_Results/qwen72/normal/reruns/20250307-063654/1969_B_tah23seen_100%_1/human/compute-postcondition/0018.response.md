Postcondition: ***`s` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 200,000, `i` is the third character of `s`. If `i` is '0' and `one` was greater than 0, `one` is set to 0 and `cost` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `one` remains 1 if `i` is '1', and both `one` and `cost` remain 0 if `i` is '0' and `one` was 0.***
