The code snippet `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`. The new element is the sum of the element at index `i - 1` in `a` and the element at index `i - 1` in `T`.

- `a` initially contains the integer 1000.
- `i` is 1.
- `T` is a list of integers.

The element at index `i - 1` in `a` is `1000` (since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0).
The element at index `i - 1` in `T` is `T[0]`.

Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `1000 + T[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1), `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 1**.
