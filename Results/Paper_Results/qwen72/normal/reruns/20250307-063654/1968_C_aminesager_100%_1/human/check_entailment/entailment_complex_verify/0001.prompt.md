You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array `a`, and a list of integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) of length `n-1` representing the remainders. The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')
        
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sums of the first `n-1` elements of `T`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` of length `n-1`. It then constructs a list `a` starting with the integer 1000, followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `x`. The function prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` being 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \).
- We need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
  - \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
  - \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) in the array \( a \).
   - It then reads the \( n-1 \) elements of the array \( x \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the array \( a \) with a single element \( 1000 \).

3. **Constructing the Array \( a \):**
   - The program iterates from \( i = 1 \) to \( n-1 \) (0-indexed).
   - For each \( i \), it appends \( a[i-1] + T[i-1] \) to the array \( a \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array \( a \) for each test case.

### Reasoning:
- **Initial Value of \( a_1 \):**
  - The program starts with \( a_1 = 1000 \). This is a valid choice because \( 1 \le 1000 \le 10^9 \).

- **Constructing \( a_i \) for \( i \ge 2 \):**
  - The program sets \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \).
  - This ensures that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) because \( a_i \) is exactly \( a_{i-1} \) plus \( x_i \), and the remainder when \( a_i \) is divided by \( a_{i-1} \) is \( x_i \).

- **Range Constraints:**
  - The values \( a_i \) are constructed as \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \).
  - Since \( 1 \le x_i \le 500 \) and \( a_1 = 1000 \), the values of \( a_i \) will be in the range \( 1000 + (i-1) \times 1 \le a_i \le 1000 + (i-1) \times 500 \).
  - For \( n \le 500 \), the maximum value of \( a_n \) will be \( 1000 + 499 \times 500 = 1000 + 249500 = 250500 \), which is within the range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \).

- **Test Case Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a while loop that decrements \( t \) after processing each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array \( a \) such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \) and ensures that \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \). Therefore, the program is correct.
