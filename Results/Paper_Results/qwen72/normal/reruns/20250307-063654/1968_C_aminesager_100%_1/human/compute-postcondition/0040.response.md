Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3), `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` and now includes an additional element `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is a new input string.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`.
- The new element is the sum of the last element in `a` (which is `a[i - 1]`) and the last element in `T` (which is `T[i - 1]`).
- The values of `t`, `n`, `T`, `i`, `result`, and `line` remain unchanged.
- The list `a` now contains one additional element, which is the sum of the last element in `a` and the last element in `T`.
