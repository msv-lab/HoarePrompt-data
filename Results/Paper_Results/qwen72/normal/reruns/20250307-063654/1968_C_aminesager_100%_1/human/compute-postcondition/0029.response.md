Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2), `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to `n-1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is an input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts each element in the list `a` to a string and then joins them with a space.
- The value of `result` is now a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `T`, `a`, `i`, `line`) remain unchanged.
