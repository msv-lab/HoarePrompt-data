Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer.
   - `a` is a list containing the integer 1000 and the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
   - `line` is an input string.

2. **Steps to Determine the Output:**
   - The list `T` is derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer.
   - The list `a` is initialized with the integer 1000.
   - The cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to `n-1` are added to the list `a`.
   - The variable `i` is set to `n - 1`, which is the index of the last element in `T` that is included in the cumulative sum.
   - The variable `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `line` is "1 2 3 4 5".
   - `T` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - If `n` is 4, then `i` is `n - 1` which is 3.
   - The cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to index 3 are:
     - `T[0]` = 1
     - `T[0] + T[1]` = 1 + 2 = 3
     - `T[0] + T[1] + T[2]` = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
     - `T[0] + T[1] + T[2] + T[3]` = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
   - The list `a` would be `[1000, 1, 3, 6, 10]`.
   - The variable `result` would be the string "1000 1 3 6 10".

4. **General Case:**
   - The list `a` will always start with 1000.
   - The subsequent elements of `a` will be the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to index `n-1`.
   - The variable `result` will be a string containing these elements separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be a string containing the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces, where the first element is 1000 and the subsequent elements are the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to `n-1`.

Output: **1000 [cumulative sum of T[0]] [cumulative sum of T[0] + T[1]] ... [cumulative sum of T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-1]] (where each cumulative sum is the sum of the elements in T up to the respective index)**
