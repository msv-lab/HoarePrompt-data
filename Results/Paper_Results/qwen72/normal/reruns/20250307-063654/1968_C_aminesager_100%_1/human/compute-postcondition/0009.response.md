The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1 to 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1), `n` must be greater than 2, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and 1000 + T[0], `i` is 2**
