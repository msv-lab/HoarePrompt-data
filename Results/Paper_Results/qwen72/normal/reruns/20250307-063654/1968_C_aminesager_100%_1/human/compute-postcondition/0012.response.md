Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1), `n` must be greater than 2, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2], `i` is 3**

The code appends the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, the new element appended to `a` is `a[2] + T[2]`, which is `1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2]`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
