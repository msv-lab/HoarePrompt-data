The variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2), `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to `n-1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is an input string**
