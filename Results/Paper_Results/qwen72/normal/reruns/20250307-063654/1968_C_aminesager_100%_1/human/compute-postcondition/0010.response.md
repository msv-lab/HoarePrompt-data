Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1), `n` must be greater than 2, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `i` is 2**

The code appends the value `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`, which is `1000 + T[0]`, and `T[i - 1]` is `T[1]`. Therefore, the new value appended to `a` is `1000 + T[0] + T[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
