Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1).
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `T` is a list of integers.
   - `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2].
   - `i` is n-1.
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

2. **Understanding the List `a`:**
   - The list `a` starts with the integer 1000.
   - Each subsequent element in `a` is the sum of 1000 and the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `T`, where `i` ranges from 0 to n-2.
   - For example, if `T = [10, 20, 30, 40]` and `n = 4`, then:
     - `a[0] = 1000`
     - `a[1] = 1000 + T[0] = 1000 + 10 = 1010`
     - `a[2] = 1000 + T[0] + T[1] = 1000 + 10 + 20 = 1030`
     - `a[3] = 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + T[2] = 1000 + 10 + 20 + 30 = 1060`

3. **Constructing the String `result`:**
   - The string `result` is created by joining the elements of the list `a` with spaces.
   - For the example above, `result` would be `"1000 1010 1030 1060"`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result` which contains the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
   - The elements of `a` are the cumulative sums starting from 1000 and adding the elements of `T` up to the (n-2)-th element.

Output: **"1000 1000 + T[0] 1000 + T[0] + T[1] ... 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]" (where each element is the cumulative sum starting from 1000 and adding the elements of T up to the (n-2)-th element)**
