Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3), `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is a new input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`.
- The new element is the sum of the last element in `a` (which is 1000) and the element in `T` at the index `i - 1`.
- `i` is `n - 1`, so `i - 1` is `n - 2`.
- Therefore, the new element in `a` is `1000 + T[n - 2]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `T`, `i`, `result`, `line`) remain unchanged.
