To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the current state:

### Given State:
- `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer
- `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, and `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`
- `i` is `n`
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces
- `line` is an input string

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-1` (i.e., `1 ≤ i < n`).
3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **Current `i` Value**: `i` is `n`.
- **Next `i` Value**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n + 1`.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute again if `i` is still less than `n`. However, since `i` is already `n`, the loop will not execute again unless `n` is increased. But we cannot modify `n` as it is an input integer and not part of the loop head.

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is already `n` and the loop condition is `1 ≤ i < n`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2), `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, and `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is an input string**
