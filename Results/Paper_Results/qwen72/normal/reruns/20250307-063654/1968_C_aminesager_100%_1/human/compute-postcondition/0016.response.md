The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is a positive integer (i.e., `t > 0`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1), `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces**
