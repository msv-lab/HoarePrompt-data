Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array `a`, and a list of integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) of length `n-1` representing the remainders. The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
