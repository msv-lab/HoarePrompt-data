The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, and the list `T`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The list `T` must still have enough elements for the loop to continue, but this is not directly controlled by the loop head.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1), `n` must be greater than 2, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], and 1000 + T[0] + T[1], `i` is 3**
