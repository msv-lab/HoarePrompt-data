### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a`**:
   - The program initializes the array `a` with the value 1000. This is a valid starting point because the problem specifies that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\), and 1000 falls within this range.

2. **Loop to Construct `a`**:
   - The program iterates from `i = 1` to `n-1` (inclusive) and appends to `a` the value `a[i-1] + T[i-1]`.
   - This construction ensures that for each `i` from 2 to `n`, \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = T[i-1]\). This is because `a[i]` is constructed as `a[i-1] + T[i-1]`, and the remainder of `a[i]` divided by `a[i-1]` will always be `T[i-1]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed array `a` as a space-separated string, which is the required format for the output.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly. For example, if `T = [500]`, the program will output `1000 1500`, which satisfies \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1500 \bmod 1000 = 500\).

5. **Constraints**:
   - The program adheres to the constraints \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\). Since `a` starts with 1000 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and a value from `T` (which is at most 500), the values in `a` will not exceed \(10^9\) given the maximum length of `T` (500) and the maximum value in `T` (500).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
