Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sums of the first `n-1` elements of `T`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- **`n` is an input integer greater than 1**: For each test case, `n` is read from the input and must be greater than 1, as specified in the problem constraints.
- **`T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer**: For each test case, `T` is populated by splitting the input string `line` and converting each element to an integer.
- **`a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sums of the first `n-1` elements of `T`**: The list `a` is constructed by starting with 1000 and then adding the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to `n-1`.
- **`i` is `n - 1`**: The loop variable `i` will be `n - 1` after the last iteration of the inner loop, which constructs the list `a`.
- **`result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces**: The final `result` string is a space-separated list of the elements in `a`, which is printed for each test case.

This output state describes the final condition of the variables after the loop has processed all `t` test cases.
