The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n`, and `n` must be greater than `n - 1`.

However, once `i` reaches `n`, the loop condition `i < n` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `n - 1` and `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, which is always true if `n` is greater than 1.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, the new state for `i` will be `n`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2), `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is an input string.**
