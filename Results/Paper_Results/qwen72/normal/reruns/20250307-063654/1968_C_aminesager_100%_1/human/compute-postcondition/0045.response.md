Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3).
2. `n` must be greater than 1.
3. `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer.
4. `a` is a list containing the integer 1000 and the cumulative sums of the first `n-1` elements of `T`.
5. `i` is `n - 1`.
6. `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`T` List Construction:**
   - The list `T` is derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer. For example, if `line = "1 2 3 4"`, then `T = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.

2. **`a` List Construction:**
   - The list `a` starts with the integer 1000.
   - It then contains the cumulative sums of the first `n-1` elements of `T`.
   - For example, if `T = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 4`, then the first `n-1` elements of `T` are `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - The cumulative sums of `[1, 2, 3]` are `[1, 3, 6]`.
   - Therefore, `a` would be `[1000, 1, 3, 6]`.

3. **`i` Value:**
   - `i` is set to `n - 1`. If `n = 4`, then `i = 3`.

4. **`result` String Construction:**
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
   - For the example `a = [1000, 1, 3, 6]`, `result` would be `"1000 1 3 6"`.

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`, which contains the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. The list `a` starts with 1000 and then contains the cumulative sums of the first `n-1` elements of the list `T`.

Since the exact values of `T` and `n` are not provided, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **1000 [cumulative_sum_1] [cumulative_sum_2] ... [cumulative_sum_(n-1)] (where each cumulative_sum_i is the cumulative sum of the first i elements of the list T)**
