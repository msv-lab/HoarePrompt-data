Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array `a`, and a list of integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) of length `n-1` representing the remainders. The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `t` is assigned the value of an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1), `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2), `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to `n-1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is an input string.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3), `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sums of the first `n-1` elements of `T`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
