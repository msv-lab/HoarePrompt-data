Output State: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1)**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `t` is `t - 1`. Since `t` was initially a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, after the decrement, `t` is now a positive integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1. The precondition that `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases remains unchanged.
