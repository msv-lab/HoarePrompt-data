Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3), `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sums of the first `n-1` elements of `T`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is a new input string.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, so it runs `n-1` times.
- In each iteration, the list `a` is updated by appending the sum of the last element of `a` and the current element of `T`.
- After all iterations, `a` will contain `1000` followed by the cumulative sums of the first `n-1` elements of `T`.
- The variable `i` is not used in the loop body and remains `n - 1` after the loop.
- The variable `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, which will reflect the final state of `a`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `T`, `line`) remain unchanged.
