Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2), `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, and `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is an input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` adds a new element to the list `a`. This new element is the sum of the last element in `a` (which is `a[i - 1]`) and the last element in `T` (which is `T[i - 1]`).
- The list `a` now contains the integers 1000 and the newly appended value `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`.
- The value of `i` remains `n`.
- The value of `result` remains a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
- The value of `line` remains an input string.
- The value of `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
- The list `T` remains a list of integers derived from the input string `line`.
