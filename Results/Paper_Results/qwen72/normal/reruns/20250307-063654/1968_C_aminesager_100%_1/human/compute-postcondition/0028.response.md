Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2), `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to `n-1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is an input string.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- The variable `n` is still the input integer, which must be greater than 1.
- The list `T` remains unchanged, containing the integers derived from the input string `line`.
- The list `a` now contains the initial value 1000 followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to the `n-1` index.
- The variable `i` is `n - 1`, as it was initialized to `n - 1` and the loop does not modify it.
- The variable `result` is a string that contains all the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
- The input string `line` remains unchanged.
