Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2), `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is an input string.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to the list `a`.
- `a` initially contains the integer 1000.
- `i` is `n - 1`, so `a[i - 1]` refers to the last element in `a` before the append operation, which is 1000.
- `T[i - 1]` is the element in the list `T` at index `i - 1`.
- After the append operation, `a` now contains two elements: 1000 and `1000 + T[i - 1]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `T`, `i`, `result`, and `line` remain unchanged.
