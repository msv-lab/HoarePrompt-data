Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` of length `n-1`. It then constructs a list `a` starting with the integer 1000, followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `x`. The function prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` being 0. **
