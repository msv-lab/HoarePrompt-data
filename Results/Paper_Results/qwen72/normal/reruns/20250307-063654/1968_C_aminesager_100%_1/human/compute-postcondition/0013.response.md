Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1), `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once, `T` is still a list of integers, and `a` is now a list containing the initial value 1000 and the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` from the first element up to the (n-2)-th element. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` after the final iteration.
