Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2), `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, and `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is an input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends the value `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to the list `a`.
- Since `i` is `n`, the value `a[n - 1] + T[n - 1]` is appended to `a`.
- The list `a` now contains the integers 1000, `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` (repeated twice), and the newly appended value `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `T`, `i`, `result`, and `line` remain unchanged.
