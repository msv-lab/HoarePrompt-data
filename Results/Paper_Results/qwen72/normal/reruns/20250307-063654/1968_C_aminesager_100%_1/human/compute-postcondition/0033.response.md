Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3), `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sums of the elements in `T` up to `n-1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `line` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer greater than 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
