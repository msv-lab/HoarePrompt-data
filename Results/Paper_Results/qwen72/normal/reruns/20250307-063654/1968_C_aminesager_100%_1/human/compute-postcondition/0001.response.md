The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is assigned the value of an input integer, and it is stated that `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Since `t` is already a positive integer, the loop can certainly execute at least once.

State: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
