Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2), `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2], `i` is n-1, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.** 

The value of `t` is decreased by 1, but all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
