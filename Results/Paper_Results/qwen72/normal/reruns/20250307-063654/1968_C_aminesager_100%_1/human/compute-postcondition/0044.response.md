Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3), `n` must be greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` by splitting it and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and the cumulative sums of the first `n-1` elements of `T`, `i` is `n - 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts each element of the list `a` to a string and joins them with spaces, assigning the resulting string to `result`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `T`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `result` now contains the elements of `a` as a space-separated string.
