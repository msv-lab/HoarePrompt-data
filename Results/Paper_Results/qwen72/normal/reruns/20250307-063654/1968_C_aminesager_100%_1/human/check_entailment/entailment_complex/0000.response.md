Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of constructing an array `a` based on the given array `x` such that for each `2 ≤ i ≤ n`, `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`. The function follows these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `T` (which corresponds to `x` in the problem statement).
3. It initializes the array `a` with a starting value of 1000.
4. It then iterates through the list `T` and for each element `T[i-1]`, it appends `a[i-1] + T[i-1]` to the array `a`.
5. Finally, it prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string.

### Analysis:

- **Initialization of `a` with 1000:**
  - The choice of 1000 as the initial value for `a[0]` is arbitrary but valid. Since `1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500`, the value of `a[0]` must be greater than or equal to `x_2` to ensure that `a_2 % a_1 = x_2`. 1000 is a safe choice because it is greater than the maximum possible value of `x_2`.

- **Construction of `a`:**
  - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the function appends `a[i-1] + T[i-1]` to the array `a`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = T[i-1]` because:
    - `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`
    - `a[i] % a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + T[i-1]) % a[i-1] = T[i-1]`
  - This construction guarantees that the conditions `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` are satisfied for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

- **Output:**
  - The function prints the elements of `a` as a space-separated string, which is the correct format for the output.

### Potential Issues:
- **Constraint on `a_i`:**
  - The problem specifies that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The values constructed in `a` are of the form `1000 + k * x_i` where `k` is the cumulative sum of previous `x_i` values. Since `x_i` is at most 500 and `n` is at most 500, the maximum value of `a_i` is `1000 + 500 * 499 = 250500`, which is well within the constraint of `10^9`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly. In this case, `a` will be `[1000, 1000 + x_2]`, which satisfies the condition `x_2 = a_2 % 1000`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly constructs the array `a` based on the given array `x` and satisfies all the conditions specified in the problem statement. The constraints are also respected, and the output format is correct.

Correctness: **True**
