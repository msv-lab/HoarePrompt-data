Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` as specified in the problem description.

2. **Sorting `b`**: The program sorts the list `b` to facilitate the selection of the most extreme values (either the smallest or the largest) that will maximize the difference with the elements in `a`.

3. **Heap Initialization**: A max heap is used to store the potential differences between elements in `a` and the smallest or largest elements in `b`. The heap is initialized by calculating the differences between each element in `a` and the first and last elements in `b`, and then pushing the negative of the maximum difference along with the element from `a` and the corresponding index from `b` into the heap. This ensures that the heap always pops the element with the largest difference.

4. **Heap Processing**: The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`. It pops the element with the largest difference from the heap and checks if the corresponding index from `b` has already been used. If so, it recalculates the difference using the next available smallest or largest element in `b`. If not, it adds the difference to `ans` and updates the indices `tp1` and `tp2` to indicate the next available elements in `b`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total difference `D` for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when all elements in `b` are the same (e.g., the second test case) and when `n` and `m` are equal (e.g., the third test case).

7. **Efficiency**: The use of a heap ensures that the program efficiently selects the elements from `b` that maximize the difference, which is crucial given the constraints on the size of `n` and `m`.

8. **Correctness Verification**: The execution summary confirms that the program processes the input correctly, maintains the heap, and prints the results for each test case. The final state of the program is consistent with the expected behavior.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
