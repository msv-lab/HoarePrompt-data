The value of `ans` is updated by adding the negation of the first element of `item` to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`) and the state of `max_heap` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged except `ans` is increased by the positive value of `item[0]`.**
