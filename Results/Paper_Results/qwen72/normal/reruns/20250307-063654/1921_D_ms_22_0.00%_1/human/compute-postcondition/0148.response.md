The loop head only contains the variable `max_heap`, which is a condition for the loop to execute. The loop will continue to execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` contains one less tuple than before. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `max_heap` must still contain at least one tuple.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is outside the range [tp1, tp2], `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is within the range [tp1, tp2], `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
