Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples. Each tuple in `max_heap` is of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]` (`diff1`) is greater than the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]` (`diff2`), or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`. `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `diff1`, `item` is the tuple with the highest priority (smallest negative difference) from `max_heap`. The current value of `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` (1) or greater than `tp2` (`m - 1`). `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[m - 1]`, and the current value of `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**
