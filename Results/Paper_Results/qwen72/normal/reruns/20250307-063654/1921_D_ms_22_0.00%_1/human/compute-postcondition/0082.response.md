To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `max_heap` is an empty heap.
   - `tp1` is `n`.
   - `tp2` is `m - n - 1`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation.

2. **Understanding the Calculation of `ans`:**
   - The goal is to find the closest element in `b` for each element in `a` such that no element in `b` is used more than once.
   - Since `b` is sorted, we can use a two-pointer technique or a binary search to find the closest element efficiently.
   - The `max_heap` is likely used to keep track of the differences and ensure that the closest elements are used without repetition.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - For each element `a_i` in `a`, find the closest element in `b` that has not been used yet.
   - Calculate the absolute difference between `a_i` and the closest element in `b`.
   - Add this difference to `ans`.
   - Ensure that the closest element in `b` is marked as used (e.g., by removing it from `b` or using a separate list to track used elements).

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of absolute differences.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation)**
