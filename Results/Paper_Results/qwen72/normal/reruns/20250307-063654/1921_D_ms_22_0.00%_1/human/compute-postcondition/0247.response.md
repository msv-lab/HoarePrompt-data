The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. Specifically, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, and `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but it is expected to return some result based on the input parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` and lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters.**
