Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `diff2`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, and `tp1` remain unchanged.
- The value of `tp2` is decremented by 1.
- The value of `diff2` remains the same, but it is used to update `ans`.
- The state of `ans` is now `ans` plus the value of `diff2`.
