Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` (`b[0]`), `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b` (`b[m - 1]`).**
