### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.
   - The list `b` is sorted, which is a necessary step for the algorithm to work.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A max heap is used to store tuples of the form `(-diff, a_i, b_i_index)`, where `diff` is the absolute difference between `a_i` and the smallest or largest element in `b`.
   - This ensures that the largest differences are considered first when constructing the array `c`.

3. **Heap Population**:
   - For each element `i` in `a`, the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest (`b[0]`) and largest (`b[m-1]`) elements in `b`.
   - It then pushes the larger difference (with a negative sign to simulate a max heap using Python's `heapq`) along with the original element `i` and the index of the chosen element in `b` into the heap.

4. **Heap Processing**:
   - The program processes the heap by popping the element with the largest difference.
   - If the chosen element in `b` has already been used (indicated by `tp1` and `tp2`), it recalculates the differences with the next available elements in `b`.
   - The program ensures that the chosen elements in `b` are not reused by incrementing `tp1` or decrementing `tp2` accordingly.
   - The absolute difference is added to `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, `t` is decremented to 0, and the program terminates.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The use of a max heap ensures that the largest differences are considered first, which is crucial for maximizing the total difference `D`.
- The program correctly avoids reusing elements in `b` by maintaining `tp1` and `tp2` to track the used indices.
- The logic for recalculating differences when the chosen element in `b` is already used is sound and ensures that the maximum possible difference is achieved.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
