Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `max_heap` now contains one less tuple, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1 - 1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is `tp1 + 1`, `ans` is `ans + diff1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by `diff1`.
- `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1 - 1]`.
- `tp1` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
