Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then if `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1 + 1]`, and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`, and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is increased by the value of `item[0]` (which is the negative of the first element of the tuple `item`). If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
