Postcondition: ***`item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference that was in `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, `ans` is increased by the positive value `-item[0]`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1. `max_heap` must not be empty.***
