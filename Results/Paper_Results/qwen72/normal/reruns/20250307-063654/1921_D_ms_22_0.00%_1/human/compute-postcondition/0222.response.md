Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by `diff2`, which is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, and `tp2` remain unchanged, except for the fact that `tp2` is now `tp2 - 1`.
