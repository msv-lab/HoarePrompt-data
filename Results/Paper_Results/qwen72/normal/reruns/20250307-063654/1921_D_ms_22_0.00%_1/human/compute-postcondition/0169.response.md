Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is `m`, `tp2` is `-1`, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not yet matched by the algorithm.**

The code snippet `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state is updated to reflect that `b` is now a sorted list.
