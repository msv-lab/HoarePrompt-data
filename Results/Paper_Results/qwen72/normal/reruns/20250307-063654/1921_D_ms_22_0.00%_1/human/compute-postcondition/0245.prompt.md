Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The program is currently executing as the main module.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b.sort()
    max_heap = []
    tp1 = 0
    tp2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    for i in a:
        diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
        diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
        else:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))
    while max_heap:
        item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
            diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
            diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
            if diff1 > diff2:
                tp1 += 1
                ans += diff1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
                ans += diff2
        else:
            ans += -item[0]
            if item[2] == tp1:
                tp1 += 1
            else:
                tp2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` is empty. `tp1` is `n` and `tp2` is `m - n - 1`. `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is `m`, `tp2` is `-1`, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not yet matched by the algorithm.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ tp1 ≤ m, `tp2` is an integer such that 0 ≤ tp2 ≤ m, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet matched, with `tp1` and `tp2` indicating the indices of the elements in `b` that have been matched.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
