Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `max_heap` now contains one less tuple.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the following:
- `item` is now the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`.
- `max_heap` now contains one less tuple than before.
