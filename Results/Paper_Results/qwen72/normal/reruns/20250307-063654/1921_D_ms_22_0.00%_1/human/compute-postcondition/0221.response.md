Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`.** 

The value of `tp2` is decremented by 1, and `diff2` is now the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
