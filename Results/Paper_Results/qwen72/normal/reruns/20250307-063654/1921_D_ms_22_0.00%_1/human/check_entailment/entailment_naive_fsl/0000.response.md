Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to maximize the total difference \( D \) between Petya's array \( a_i \) and Vasya's array \( c_i \). Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting \( b_i \)**: The array \( b_i \) is sorted to facilitate the selection of the most different elements.
3. **Heap Initialization**: A max heap is used to store the differences between elements of \( a_i \) and the smallest and largest elements of \( b_i \). This helps in efficiently selecting the largest differences.
4. **Heap Operations**: The program pushes the differences and their corresponding indices into the max heap. It then pops the largest difference from the heap and ensures that the selected element from \( b_i \) is not already used.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( m = n \) and all elements in \( b_i \) are the same, the program correctly outputs 0.
   - When \( m > n \), the program correctly selects the \( n \) elements from \( b_i \) that maximize the total difference \( D \).

The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem, and it appears to work correctly for all potential inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
