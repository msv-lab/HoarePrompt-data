Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, `ans` is increased by the value of `item[0]` (which is a non-negative integer), `tp1` is increased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `tp1` is increased by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still an integer between 0 and 97, `n` is still an input integer, `m` is still an input integer, `a` is still a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is still a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` still contains `n-3` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is still the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, and `ans` is still increased by the value of `item[0]` (which is a non-negative integer).
