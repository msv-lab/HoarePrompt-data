Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple and now contains one less tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by `diff2`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, and `tp1` remain unchanged.
- `tp2` is decremented by 1.
- `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`.
- `ans` is now `ans + diff2`.
