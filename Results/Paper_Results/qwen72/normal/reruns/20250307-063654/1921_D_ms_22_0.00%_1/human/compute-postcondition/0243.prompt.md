Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples. Each tuple in `max_heap` is of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, where `i` is an element from `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and `index` is 0 if `diff1` > `diff2`, otherwise `index` is `m - 1`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, where `i` is an element from `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and `index` is 0 if `diff1` > `diff2`, otherwise `index` is `m - 1`. `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` is set to 1 if `diff1` > `diff2` and `tp2` is set to `m - 1`, otherwise `tp1` is set to 0 and `tp2` is set to `m - 2`, and `ans` is set to the larger of `diff1` and `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, then `ans` is increased by the value of `item[0]` (a non-positive integer), and if `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`, otherwise `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then if `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1 + 1]`, and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`, and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is increased by the value of `item[0]` (which is the negative of the first element of the tuple `item`). If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then: if `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff1`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1 + 1]`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff2`, where `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, then `ans` is increased by the value of `item[0]` (which is a non-negative integer). If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
