Postcondition: ***`item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `ans` is increased by the positive value of `item[0]`. If `item[2] == tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
