Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` is empty. `tp1` is `n` and `tp2` is `m - n - 1`. `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
