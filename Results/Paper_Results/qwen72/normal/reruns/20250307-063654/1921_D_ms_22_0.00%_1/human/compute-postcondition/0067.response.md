The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `max_heap` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` contains one less tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, `max_heap` must still contain at least one tuple.

State: **`item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `max_heap` must not be empty.**
