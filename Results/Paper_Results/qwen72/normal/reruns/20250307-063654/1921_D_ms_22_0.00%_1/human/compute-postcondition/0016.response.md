The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))` pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` into the `max_heap`. Since `max_heap` is a max-heap implemented using a min-heap by pushing negative values, the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` will be inserted into `max_heap` such that the heap property is maintained. The first element of the tuple, `-diff1`, is the key used for the heap ordering, and it is the negative of `diff1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `max_heap` is an empty list
- `tp1` is 0
- `tp2` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is the first element of `a`
- `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`
- `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`
- The current value of `diff1` is greater than the current value of `diff2`

After executing the code snippet:
- `max_heap` is no longer empty and contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and the current value of `diff1` is greater than the current value of `diff2`.**
