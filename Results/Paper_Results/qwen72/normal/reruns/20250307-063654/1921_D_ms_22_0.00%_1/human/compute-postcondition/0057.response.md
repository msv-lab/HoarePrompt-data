Output State: **`item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `diff1` is the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`. `diff2` is the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. `tp1` is increased by 1.**
