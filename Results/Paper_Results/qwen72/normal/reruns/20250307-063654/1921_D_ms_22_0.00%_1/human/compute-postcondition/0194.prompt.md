Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing a single tuple. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` contains two tuples: `(-diff1, i, 0)` and either `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` or the original tuple, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)` and the original tuple. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` contains three tuples: if `diff1 > diff2`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `(-diff1, i, 0)`, and either `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` or the original tuple; otherwise, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, and either `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` or the original tuple. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
