The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

- `a` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- The previous state of `a` being a list of `n` integers is no longer valid, as `a` is now updated with the new input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` is empty. `tp1` is `n` and `tp2` is `m - n - 1`. `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation.**
