Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `ans = 0` sets the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The variable `ans` was previously described as the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not yet matched by the algorithm, but now it is explicitly set to 0.
