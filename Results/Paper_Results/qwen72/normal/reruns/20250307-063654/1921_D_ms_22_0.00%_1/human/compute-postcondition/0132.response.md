Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples. Each tuple in `max_heap` is of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]` (`diff1`) is greater than the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]` (`diff2`), or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`. `ans` is the original `ans` value plus the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[item[2]]`, `item` is the tuple with the highest priority (smallest negative difference) from `max_heap`, and `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is updated to 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`. If `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`.***
