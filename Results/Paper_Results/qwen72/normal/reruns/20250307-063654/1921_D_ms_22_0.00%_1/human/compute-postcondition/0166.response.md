Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is `m`, `tp2` is `-1`, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not yet matched by the algorithm.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the `input()` function, which splits the input into two parts and converts them to integers.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged from the initial state.
