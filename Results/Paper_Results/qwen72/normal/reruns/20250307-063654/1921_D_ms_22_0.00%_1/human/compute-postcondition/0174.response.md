The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` during the first iteration.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. The state of `i` will be the first element of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of `a`**
