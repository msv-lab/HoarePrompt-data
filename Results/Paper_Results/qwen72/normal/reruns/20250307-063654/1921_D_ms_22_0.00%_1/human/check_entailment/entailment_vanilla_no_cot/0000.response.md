Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the given problem. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**: The array `b` is sorted to facilitate the selection of the maximum possible differences. A max heap (implemented using a min heap with negative values) is used to store the differences between elements of `a` and the smallest and largest elements of `b`.

3. **Heap Population**: For each element `i` in `a`, the program calculates the differences `diff1` and `diff2` with the smallest and largest elements of `b`, respectively. It then pushes the maximum difference along with the element and the index of the corresponding element in `b` into the heap.

4. **Heap Processing**: The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`. It pops the top element from the heap and checks if the index of the element in `b` is within the current range `[tp1, tp2]`. If not, it recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest elements in the range and updates the range accordingly. If the index is within the range, it directly adds the difference to `ans` and updates the range.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the maximum total difference `D` for each test case.

The logic ensures that the maximum possible differences are chosen, and the use of a heap helps in efficiently managing and selecting the best differences. The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, making it a correct solution.
