Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples, each of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the last element of `b`. `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute value of the largest negative difference from `max_heap`, `item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference from `max_heap`, and `item[2]` is 0.**
