Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.***
