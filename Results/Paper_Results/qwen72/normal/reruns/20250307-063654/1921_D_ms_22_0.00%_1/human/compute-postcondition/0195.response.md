The only object in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `max_heap` is non-empty. Right before the loop, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples. For the loop to execute the first time, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple.

Since `max_heap` is already described as containing `n` tuples, and `n` is an input integer, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples. Each tuple in `max_heap` is of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, where `i` is an element from `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and `index` is 0 if `diff1` > `diff2`, otherwise `index` is `m - 1`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**
