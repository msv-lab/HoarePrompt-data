To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context of the variables and objects involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 98\).
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `m` is an integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `max_heap` is an empty list.
   - `tp1` is `m`.
   - `tp2` is `-1`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not yet matched by the algorithm.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated based on the elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that have not been matched yet.
   - The algorithm likely involves iterating through the elements of `a` and finding the closest element in `b` for each element of `a`, ensuring that each element in `b` is used at most once.
   - The sum of the absolute differences between these matched pairs is stored in `ans`.

3. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
   - However, based on the description, `ans` will be the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and their closest matches in `b`.

Given this information, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not yet matched by the algorithm)**
