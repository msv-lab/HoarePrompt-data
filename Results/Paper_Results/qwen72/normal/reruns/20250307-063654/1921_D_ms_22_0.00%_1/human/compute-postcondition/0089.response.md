Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is `n`, `tp2` is `m - n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation.**

The code initializes `max_heap` to an empty list, but does not change any other variables. Therefore, all other initial conditions remain the same.
