Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples. Each tuple in `max_heap` is of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, where `i` is an element from `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and `index` is 0 if `diff1` > `diff2`, otherwise `index` is `m - 1`. `ans` is equal to the initial value of `ans` plus the value of `item[0]` (which is a non-positive integer), `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, and `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is decremented by 1.***
