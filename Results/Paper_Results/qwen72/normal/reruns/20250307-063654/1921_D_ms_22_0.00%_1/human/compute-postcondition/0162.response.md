Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is `m`, `tp2` is `-1`, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not yet matched by the algorithm.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 0 to 98, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains an integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains an integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains a list of integers with `n` elements, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`b`**: Remains a sorted list of integers, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`max_heap`**: Becomes an empty list after all iterations of the loop, as each iteration pops one tuple from `max_heap`.
- **`tp1`**: Starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each time an element is matched to the left end of `b`. After all iterations, `tp1` will be equal to `m`, indicating that all elements from the left end of `b` have been matched.
- **`tp2`**: Starts at `m - 1` and is decremented by 1 each time an element is matched to the right end of `b`. After all iterations, `tp2` will be `-1`, indicating that all elements from the right end of `b` have been matched.
- **`ans`**: Initially 0, `ans` accumulates the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not yet matched by the algorithm. After all iterations, `ans` will contain the total sum of these differences.
