The value of `tp2` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `tp2` was `m - 1`, so the new value of `tp2` is `m - 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is 0, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` (which is 0) or greater than `tp2` (which is `m - 2`), `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**
