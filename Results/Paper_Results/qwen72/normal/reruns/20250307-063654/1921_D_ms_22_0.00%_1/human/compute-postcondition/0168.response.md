The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`.

- `b` is now a list of integers provided by the input.
- The initial state specifies that `b` was a sorted list of integers, but this is no longer necessarily true after the new assignment.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is `m`, `tp2` is `-1`, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not yet matched by the algorithm.**
