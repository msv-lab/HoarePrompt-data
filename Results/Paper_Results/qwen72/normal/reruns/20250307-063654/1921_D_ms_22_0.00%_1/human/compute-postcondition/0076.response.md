The value of `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. Since `item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference that was in `max_heap`, the first element of `item` is a negative value. Therefore, `-item[0]` is a positive value, and `ans` is incremented by this positive value. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `max_heap` still contains one less tuple than before.

Output State: **`item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference that was in `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `ans` is increased by the positive value `-item[0]`. `max_heap` must not be empty.**
