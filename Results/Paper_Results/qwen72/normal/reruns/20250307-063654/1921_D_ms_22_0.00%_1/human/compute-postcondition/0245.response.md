Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` is an empty list. `tp1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ tp1 ≤ m, `tp2` is an integer such that 0 ≤ tp2 ≤ m, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet matched, with `tp1` and `tp2` indicating the indices of the elements in `b` that have been matched.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be decremented to 0 because the loop runs until `t` is no longer greater than 0.
- **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5**: These values remain unchanged for each test case as they are read from input at the beginning of each iteration.
- **`a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**: This list is also read from input at the beginning of each iteration and remains unchanged within the loop.
- **`b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9**: This list is sorted at the beginning of each iteration and remains sorted throughout the loop.
- **`max_heap` is an empty list**: The `max_heap` is used to store the absolute differences and is emptied at the end of each test case.
- **`tp1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ tp1 ≤ m**: `tp1` tracks the index of the smallest element in `b` that has not been matched yet. After all iterations, `tp1` will be an integer within the range of 0 to `m`.
- **`tp2` is an integer such that 0 ≤ tp2 ≤ m**: `tp2` tracks the index of the largest element in `b` that has not been matched yet. After all iterations, `tp2` will be an integer within the range of 0 to `m`.
- **`ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet matched**: The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of the absolute differences for each test case. After all iterations, `ans` will hold the final result for the last test case.
