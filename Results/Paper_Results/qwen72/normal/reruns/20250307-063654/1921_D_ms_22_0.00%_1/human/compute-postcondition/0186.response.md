Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))` adds a new tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` to the `max_heap`.
- Before this operation, `max_heap` contained a single tuple: `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`.
- After the operation, `max_heap` now contains both tuples: `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, `diff2`) remain unchanged.
