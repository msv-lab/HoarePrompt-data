Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ tp1 ≤ m, `tp2` is an integer such that 0 ≤ tp2 ≤ m, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet matched, with `tp1` and `tp2` indicating the indices of the elements in `b` that have been matched.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`max_heap`**: The loop continues to pop elements from `max_heap` until it is empty. Therefore, after all iterations, `max_heap` will be an empty list.
- **`tp1` and `tp2`**: These variables are incremented or decremented based on the conditions inside the loop. After all iterations, `tp1` and `tp2` will indicate the indices of the elements in `b` that have been matched to elements in `a`. The exact values of `tp1` and `tp2` will depend on the specific elements in `a` and `b`, but they will be within the range 0 to `m`.
- **`ans`**: This variable accumulates the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet matched. The loop ensures that each element in `a` is matched to the closest element in `b` that has not been matched yet, and the sum of these differences is stored in `ans`.
