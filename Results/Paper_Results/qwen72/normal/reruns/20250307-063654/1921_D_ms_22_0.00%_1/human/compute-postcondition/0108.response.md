Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. If `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` (`b[0]`), `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b` (`b[m - 1]`), `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the previous `i`.** 

The code snippet `diff1 = abs(i - b[0])` updates the value of `diff1` to be the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of the sorted list `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the next element in the list `a` after the previous `i`.
