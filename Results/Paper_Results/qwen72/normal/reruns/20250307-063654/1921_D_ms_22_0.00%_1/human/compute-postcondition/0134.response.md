The loop head in this case is `max_heap`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples. For the loop to execute one more time, `max_heap` must still contain at least one tuple.

Given that the loop has already executed, and `max_heap` originally contained `n-1` tuples, for the loop to execute again, `max_heap` must not be empty. Therefore, the state of `max_heap` should be adjusted to ensure it still contains at least one tuple.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple.**
