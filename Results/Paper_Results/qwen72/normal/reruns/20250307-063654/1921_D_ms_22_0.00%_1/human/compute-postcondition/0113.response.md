Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples. Each tuple in `max_heap` is of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]` (`diff1`) is greater than the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]` (`diff2`), or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an input integer within the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 98.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- **`m`**: Remains the input integer representing the number of elements in the sorted list `b`.
- **`a`**: The list of integers read from the input, which has `n` elements.
- **`b`**: The sorted list of integers read from the input, which has `m` elements.
- **`max_heap`**: After the loop has executed all `n` iterations, `max_heap` contains `n` tuples. Each tuple is formed based on the comparison between the absolute differences `diff1` and `diff2` for each element `i` in `a`. Specifically, if `diff1` (the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`) is greater than `diff2` (the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`), the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` is added to `max_heap`. Otherwise, the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` is added.
- **`tp1`**: Remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`tp2`**: Remains `m - 1`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ans`**: Remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
