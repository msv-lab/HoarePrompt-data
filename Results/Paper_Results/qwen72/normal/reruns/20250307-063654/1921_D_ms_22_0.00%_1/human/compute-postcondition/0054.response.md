Output State: **`item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.** 

In natural language: The variable `item` is now assigned the tuple that had the largest negative difference from the `max_heap`. The `max_heap` has one less tuple as a result of this operation. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
