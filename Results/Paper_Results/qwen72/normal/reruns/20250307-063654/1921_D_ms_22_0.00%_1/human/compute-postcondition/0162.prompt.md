Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples. Each tuple in `max_heap` is of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]` (`diff1`) is greater than the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]` (`diff2`), or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples. Each tuple in `max_heap` is of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]` (`diff1`) is greater than the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]` (`diff2`), or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` is updated to 1 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 1` if `diff1` > `diff2`, otherwise `tp1` is updated to 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`, and `ans` is updated to `diff1` or `diff2` accordingly. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, then `ans` is updated to the original `ans` value plus the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[item[2]]`, and if `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is updated to 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`, otherwise `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` contains one less tuple than before, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is outside the range [tp1, tp2], `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is within the range [tp1, tp2], `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple and now contains one less tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` < `tp1` or `item[2]` > `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 98. Otherwise, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
