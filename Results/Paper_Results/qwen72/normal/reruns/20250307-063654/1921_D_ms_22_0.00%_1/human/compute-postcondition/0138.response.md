Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1-1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is `tp1 + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tp1` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `diff1` is now the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1-1]` because `tp1` has been incremented.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
