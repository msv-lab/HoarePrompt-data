Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing a single tuple. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**
