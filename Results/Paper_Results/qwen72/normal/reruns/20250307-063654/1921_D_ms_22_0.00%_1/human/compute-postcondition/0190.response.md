Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` contains two tuples: `(-diff1, i, 0)` and either `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` or the original tuple, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])` calculates the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and assigns this value to `diff2`.
- The value of `i` is the third element of `a`, and `m - 1` is the index of the last element in `b`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
