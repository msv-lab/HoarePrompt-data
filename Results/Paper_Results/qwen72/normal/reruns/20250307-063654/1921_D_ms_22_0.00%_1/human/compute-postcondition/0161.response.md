Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple and now contains one less tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` < `tp1` or `item[2]` > `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 98. Otherwise, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97.***
