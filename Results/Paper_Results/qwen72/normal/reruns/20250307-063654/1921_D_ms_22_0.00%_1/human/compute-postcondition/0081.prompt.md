Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` contains `n` tuples, each of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the last element of `b`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples, each of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the last element of `b`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `diff1` if `diff1` > `diff2`, otherwise `ans` is `diff2`, and `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, then `tp1` is 1 and `tp2` is `m - 1` if `item[2]` is 0, or `tp1` is 0 and `tp2` is `m - 2` if `item[2]` is not 0, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute value of the largest negative difference from `max_heap`. In both cases, `item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference from `max_heap`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is neither less than `tp1` nor greater than `tp2`, `ans` is increased by the positive value of `item[0]`. If `item[2] == tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference that was in `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `tp1` is increased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, `ans` is increased by the positive value `-item[0]`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1. `max_heap` must not be empty.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
