Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `max_heap` now contains one less tuple, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`.** 

The code calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the tuple `item` (which was previously removed from `max_heap`) and the element at index `tp1` in the sorted list `b`, and assigns this value to `diff1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
