The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` contains a single tuple, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the last element of `b`.**
