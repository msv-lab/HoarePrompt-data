### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the array `b`.

2. **Sorting Array `b`:**
   - The program sorts the array `b` to facilitate the selection of the largest and smallest elements for maximizing the difference.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A max heap is used to store the potential differences between elements of `a` and the smallest or largest elements of `b`.
   - The heap stores tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, where `diff` is the absolute difference, `i` is the element from `a`, and `index` is the index in `b` (either 0 or `m-1`).

4. **Heap Population:**
   - For each element in `a`, the program calculates the differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b`.
   - It pushes the larger difference into the heap, along with the element from `a` and the corresponding index in `b`.

5. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - If the index in the heap item is out of the current range `[tp1, tp2]`, it recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest available elements in `b` and updates the heap.
   - Otherwise, it adds the difference to `ans` and updates the range `[tp1, tp2]` accordingly.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum total difference `D` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Maximizing Differences:**
  - The program aims to maximize the difference by always choosing the largest or smallest available element in `b` for each element in `a`.
  - This is achieved by using a max heap to keep track of the largest differences and ensuring that the elements in `b` are used optimally.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where `n` and `m` are equal, and all elements in `b` are the same (as in the second test case).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of a heap ensures that the program efficiently selects the largest differences, and the sorting of `b` is done once per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` between the arrays `a` and `c` (constructed from `b`). It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the input to produce the correct output.

### Correctness:
**True**
