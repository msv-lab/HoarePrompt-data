The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the tuple `item` and the first element of the list `b`, which is `b[tp1]`. Since `tp1` is 0, this is equivalent to `abs(item[1] - b[0])`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements
- `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input
- `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`
- `tp1` is 0
- `tp2` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is 0
- `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, and `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` (which is 0) or greater than `tp2` (which is `m - 1`)

The value of `diff1` is calculated as `abs(item[1] - b[0])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` (which is 0) or greater than `tp2` (which is `m - 1`), `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[0])`.**
