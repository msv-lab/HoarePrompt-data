Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the tuple `item` and the element at index `tp1` in the list `b`, and assigns this value to `diff1`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the new value of `diff1`.
