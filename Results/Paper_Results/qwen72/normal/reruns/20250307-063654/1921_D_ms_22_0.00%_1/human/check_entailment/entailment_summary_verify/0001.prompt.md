You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m` and lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that has not yet been matched. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers within the specified ranges, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers, and `max_heap` is an empty list. The final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case and the variables `tp1` and `tp2` indicating the indices of the elements in `b` that have been matched. If the function is not executed as the main module, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Array `b`:**
   - The program sorts the array `b` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to consider the smallest and largest elements of `b` for maximizing the difference.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a max heap using a min heap with negative values. This is a common technique to use Python's `heapq` as a max heap.
   - For each element `i` in array `a`, it calculates the absolute differences between `i` and the smallest (`b[0]`) and largest (`b[m-1]`) elements of `b`.
   - It pushes the maximum difference along with the element `i` and the index of the element in `b` (either `0` or `m-1`) into the heap.

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It pops the top element from the heap, which gives the maximum difference.
   - If the index of the element in `b` (either `0` or `m-1`) is out of the current range `[tp1, tp2]`, it recalculates the differences using the current smallest (`b[tp1]`) and largest (`b[tp2]`) elements in the range.
   - It updates the total difference `ans` and adjusts the range `[tp1, tp2]` accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm aims to maximize the total difference `D` by always choosing the largest possible difference for each element in `a`.
  - By sorting `b` and using a max heap, the program ensures that it always considers the most significant differences first.
  - The heap is used to store the differences along with the original elements and their indices in `b`, which allows the program to dynamically adjust the choices based on the current range `[tp1, tp2]`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same, as seen in the second test case.
  - It also handles the case where `n` is equal to `m`, as seen in the third test case.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting of `b` takes \(O(m \log m)\) time.
  - The heap operations (push and pop) take \(O(\log n)\) time.
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(t \cdot (m \log m + n \log n))\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` for each test case. It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the input.
