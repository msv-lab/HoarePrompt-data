Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is `m`, `tp2` is `-1`, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that were not yet matched by the algorithm.** 

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it is now an integer within the range 0 to 97. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
