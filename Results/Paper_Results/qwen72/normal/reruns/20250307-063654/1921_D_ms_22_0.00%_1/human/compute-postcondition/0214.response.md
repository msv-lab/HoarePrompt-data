Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, where `i` is an element from `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and `index` is 0 if `diff1` > `diff2`, otherwise `index` is `m - 1`. `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` is set to 1 if `diff1` > `diff2` and `tp2` is set to `m - 1`, otherwise `tp1` is set to 0 and `tp2` is set to `m - 2`, and `ans` is set to the larger of `diff1` and `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, then `ans` is increased by the value of `item[0]` (a non-positive integer), and if `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`, otherwise `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is decremented by 1.**
