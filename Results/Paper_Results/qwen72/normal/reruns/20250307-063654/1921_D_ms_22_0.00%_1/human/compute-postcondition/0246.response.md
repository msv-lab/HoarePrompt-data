Postcondition: **If the program is executed as the main module, `t` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is an integer such that 0 ≤ tp1 ≤ m, `tp2` is an integer such that 0 ≤ tp2 ≤ m, and `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet matched, with `tp1` and `tp2` indicating the indices of the elements in `b` that have been matched. If the program is not executed as the main module, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**
