The loop head in this case is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust the state of `max_heap` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `max_heap` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples, each of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the last element of `b`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `max_heap` must still contain at least one tuple. Since the loop body is omitted, we do not know how many tuples are removed in each iteration, but we know that at least one tuple is required for the next iteration.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `max_heap` must still contain at least one tuple after the previous iteration. Since `max_heap` initially contains `n-1` tuples, it must contain at least one tuple for the loop to proceed.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, each of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the last element of `b`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `diff1` if `diff1` > `diff2`, otherwise `ans` is `diff2`, and `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, then `tp1` is 1 and `tp2` is `m - 1` if `item[2]` is 0, or `tp1` is 0 and `tp2` is `m - 2` if `item[2]` is not 0, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute value of the largest negative difference from `max_heap`. In both cases, `item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference from `max_heap`.**
