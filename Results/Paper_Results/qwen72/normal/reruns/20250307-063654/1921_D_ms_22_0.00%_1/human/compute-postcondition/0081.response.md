Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` is empty. `tp1` is `n` and `tp2` is `m - n - 1`. `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n` and `m`**: The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`a` and `b`**: The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`max_heap`**: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` is empty because the loop continues to pop elements from `max_heap` until it is empty.
- **`tp1` and `tp2`**: The loop increments `tp1` and decrements `tp2` based on the conditions inside the loop. After `n` iterations (since there are `n` elements in `max_heap`), `tp1` will be `n` and `tp2` will be `m - n - 1` (assuming `m` is greater than or equal to `2n` to ensure the loop can run `n` times without `tp1` exceeding `tp2`).
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` accumulates the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation. This is done by either adding the difference to `ans` directly or by using the closest available element in `b` (either `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]`).

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
