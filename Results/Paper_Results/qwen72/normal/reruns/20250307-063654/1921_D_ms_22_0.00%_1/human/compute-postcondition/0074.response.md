Output State: **`item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference that was in `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `diff1` is the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`. `diff2` is the absolute value of the difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`. `tp2` is now `tp2 - 1`. `ans` is now `ans + diff2`.**
