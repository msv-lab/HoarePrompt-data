The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))` pushes a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` into the `max_heap` list. The `max_heap` was initially a list containing a single tuple, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`. After the code is executed, `max_heap` will contain two tuples. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples: the initial tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, and the new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` (`b[0]`), `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b` (`b[m - 1]`), `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
