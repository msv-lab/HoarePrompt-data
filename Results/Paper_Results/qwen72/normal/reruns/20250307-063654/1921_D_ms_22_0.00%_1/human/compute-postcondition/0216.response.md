Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation.** 

The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes the top element from the `max_heap` and assigns it to `item`. The `max_heap` now contains `n-2` tuples instead of `n-1` tuples. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
