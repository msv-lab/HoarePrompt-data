Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`.**
