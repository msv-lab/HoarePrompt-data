Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is `n`, `tp2` is `m - n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers, updating the value of `b`.
- The previous state of `b` being a sorted list of `m` integers is no longer valid as `b` is now a list of integers read from the new input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, and `tp2` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is still the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation, as the code snippet does not affect `ans`.
