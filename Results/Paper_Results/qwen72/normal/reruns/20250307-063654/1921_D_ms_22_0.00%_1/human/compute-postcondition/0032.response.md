Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` contains `n` tuples, each of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the corresponding element `i` in `a` and the last element of `b`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

### Explanation:
After the loop has executed all `n` iterations, the `max_heap` will contain `n` tuples. Each tuple represents the maximum absolute difference between an element `i` in the list `a` and either the first or the last element of the sorted list `b`. The tuple is structured as `(-diff, i, index)`, where `diff` is the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`, `i` is the element from `a`, and `index` is either `0` (if `diff1` is greater) or `m - 1` (if `diff2` is greater or equal). The variables `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
