### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Array `b`:**
   - The program sorts the array `b` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to consider the smallest and largest elements of `b` for maximizing the difference.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a max heap using a min heap with negative values. This is a common technique to use Python's `heapq` as a max heap.
   - For each element `i` in array `a`, it calculates the absolute differences between `i` and the smallest (`b[0]`) and largest (`b[m-1]`) elements of `b`.
   - It pushes the maximum difference along with the element `i` and the index of the element in `b` (either `0` or `m-1`) into the heap.

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It pops the top element from the heap, which gives the maximum difference.
   - If the index of the element in `b` (either `0` or `m-1`) is out of the current range `[tp1, tp2]`, it recalculates the differences using the current smallest (`b[tp1]`) and largest (`b[tp2]`) elements in the range.
   - It updates the total difference `ans` and adjusts the range `[tp1, tp2]` accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm aims to maximize the total difference `D` by always choosing the largest possible difference for each element in `a`.
  - By sorting `b` and using a max heap, the program ensures that it always considers the most significant differences first.
  - The heap is used to store the differences along with the original elements and their indices in `b`, which allows the program to dynamically adjust the choices based on the current range `[tp1, tp2]`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same, as seen in the second test case.
  - It also handles the case where `n` is equal to `m`, as seen in the third test case.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting of `b` takes \(O(m \log m)\) time.
  - The heap operations (push and pop) take \(O(\log n)\) time.
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(t \cdot (m \log m + n \log n))\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` for each test case. It handles all edge cases and efficiently processes the input.

Correctness: **True**
