The loop condition is `while max_heap:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. Given the state right before the loop, `max_heap` is described as a list containing `n` tuples. For the loop to execute the first time, `max_heap` must contain at least one tuple.

Since `max_heap` is already described as containing `n` tuples, the loop condition is already satisfied for the first iteration, assuming `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples. Each tuple in `max_heap` is of the form `(-diff1, i, 0)` if the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]` (`diff1`) is greater than the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]` (`diff2`), or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**
