Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `max_heap` now contains one less tuple, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and `b[tp2]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`.** 

In natural language: The value of `tp2` is decremented by 1, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
