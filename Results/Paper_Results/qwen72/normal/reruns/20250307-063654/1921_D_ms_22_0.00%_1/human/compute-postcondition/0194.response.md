Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples. Each tuple in `max_heap` is of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, where `i` is an element from `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, and `index` is 0 if `diff1` > `diff2`, otherwise `index` is `m - 1`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 0 to 97.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
- The variable `m` remains the input integer representing the number of elements in the list `b`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and still contains `n` elements.
- The list `b` remains unchanged and is still a sorted list of integers.
- The `max_heap` is now a list containing `n` tuples. Each tuple in `max_heap` represents an element from `a` and its maximum absolute difference with either the first or the last element of `b`, along with the index of the element in `b` that was used to compute this difference.
- The variables `tp1` and `tp2` remain 0 and `m - 1`, respectively.
- The variable `ans` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
