Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `max_heap` now contains one less tuple, `ans` is increased by the negative of the first element of `item`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the negative of the first element of the tuple `item` that was removed from `max_heap`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
