The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is not empty. Given the initial state, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5`, which means `a` is guaranteed to have at least one element. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `a` is not empty, which is already ensured by the initial state.

However, to make the state clear and ensure the loop can start, we can specify that `i` is the first element of `a`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of `a`**
