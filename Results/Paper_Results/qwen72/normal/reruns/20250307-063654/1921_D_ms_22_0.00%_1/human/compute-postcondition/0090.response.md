Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `tp1 = 0` updates the value of `tp1` to 0.
- The initial value of `tp1` was `n`, but it is now set to 0.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp2`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `tp1`.
