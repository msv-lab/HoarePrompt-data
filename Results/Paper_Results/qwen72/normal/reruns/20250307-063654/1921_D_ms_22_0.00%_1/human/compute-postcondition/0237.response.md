Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation. If `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff1`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1 + 1]`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by `diff2`, where `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`.***
