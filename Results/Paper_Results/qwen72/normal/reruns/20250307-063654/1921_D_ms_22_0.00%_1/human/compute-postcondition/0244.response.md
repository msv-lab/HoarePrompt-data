To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 97\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
   - `max_heap` is an empty list.
   - `tp1` is an integer such that \(0 \leq tp1 \leq m\).
   - `tp2` is an integer such that \(0 \leq tp2 \leq m\).
   - `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet matched, with `tp1` and `tp2` indicating the indices of the elements in `b` that have been matched.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated by summing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that has not been matched.
   - `tp1` and `tp2` are used to track which elements in `b` have already been matched to elements in `a`.

3. **Execution of the `print(ans)` statement:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the absolute differences as described above.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe what `ans` represents based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not yet matched, with `tp1` and `tp2` indicating the indices of the elements in `b` that have been matched)**
