Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` contains a single tuple, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])` updates the value of `diff2` to the absolute difference between `i` (the second element of `a`) and the last element of `b` (which is `b[m - 1]`).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
