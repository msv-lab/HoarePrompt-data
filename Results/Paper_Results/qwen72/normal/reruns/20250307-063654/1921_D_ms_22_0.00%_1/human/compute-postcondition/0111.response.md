Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing three tuples. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. If `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` (`b[0]`), `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b` (`b[m - 1]`), `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the previous `i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))` pushes the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` into the `max_heap`.
- The `max_heap` initially contains two tuples. After pushing the new tuple, it now contains three tuples.
- The specific values of `diff1` and `diff2` are not changed by this code, so they remain as the absolute differences between `i` and `b[0]` and `b[m - 1]`, respectively.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the previous `i`.
