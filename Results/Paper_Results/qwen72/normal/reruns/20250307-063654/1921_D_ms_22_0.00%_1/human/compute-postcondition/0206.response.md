Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[0])`, and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, then `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `diff2`.***
