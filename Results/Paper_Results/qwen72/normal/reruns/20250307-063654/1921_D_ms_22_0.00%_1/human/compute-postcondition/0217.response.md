Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the tuple `item` and the element at index `tp1` in the list `b`, and assigns this value to `diff1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, and `item` remain unchanged. The new value of `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.
