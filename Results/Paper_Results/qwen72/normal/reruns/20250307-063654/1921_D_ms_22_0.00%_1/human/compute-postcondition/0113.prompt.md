Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing a single tuple, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` ≤ `diff2`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` (`b[0]`), and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b` (`b[m - 1]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. If `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` (`b[0]`), `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b` (`b[m - 1]`), `i` is the next element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `max_heap` is a list containing three tuples. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. If `diff1` ≤ `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b` (`b[0]`), `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b` (`b[m - 1]`), `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the previous `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
