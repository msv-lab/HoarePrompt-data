Output State: **`item` is the tuple with the largest negative difference that was in `max_heap`, and `max_heap` now contains one less tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `ans` is increased by the positive value `-item[0]`. `tp1` is increased by 1.** 

The code snippet `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
