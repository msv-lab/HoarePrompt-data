Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 98, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `max_heap` is empty. `tp1` is `n` and `tp2` is `m - n - 1`. `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest element in `b` that was not previously used in the calculation.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`.
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, but now `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the input.
- All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
