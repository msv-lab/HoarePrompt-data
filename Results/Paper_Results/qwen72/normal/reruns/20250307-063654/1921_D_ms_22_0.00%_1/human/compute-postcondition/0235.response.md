Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 97, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples of the form `(-max(diff1, diff2), i, index)`, `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before the operation, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`.**

The code snippet `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `diff2` is now the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`, reflecting the updated value of `tp2`.
