The variable `good_subarrays` is initialized to 0. The initial state includes that `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `b` is a list of `m` integers where `1 <= m <= n` and `1 <= k <= m`, and the elements of `a` and `b` are integers in the range `1` to `10^6`. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `b` is a list of `m` integers where `1 <= m <= n` and `1 <= k <= m`, elements of `a` and `b` are integers in the range `1` to `10^6`, `good_subarrays` is 0.**
