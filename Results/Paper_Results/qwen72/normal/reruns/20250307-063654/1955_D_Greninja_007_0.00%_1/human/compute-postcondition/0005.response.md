Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `b` is a list of `m` integers where `1 <= m <= n` and `1 <= k <= m`, `good_subarrays` is 0, `b_freq` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of the list `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq` for all integers that are present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, and the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
