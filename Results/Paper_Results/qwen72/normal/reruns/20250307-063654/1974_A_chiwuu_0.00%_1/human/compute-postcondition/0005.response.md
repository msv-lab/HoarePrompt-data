Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` = `b` * 2, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**

The value of `t` is updated to be twice the value of `b`. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged and retain their initial properties.
