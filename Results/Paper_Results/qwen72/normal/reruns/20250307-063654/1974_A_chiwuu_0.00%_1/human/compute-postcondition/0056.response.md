The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with multiple test cases where each test case involves two integers, `x` and `y`, such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function is likely designed to handle a series of such test cases, possibly provided through an external mechanism (e.g., a loop or a list of tuples).

Given the constraints, the function returns different results based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case, but the specific return values are not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, we can only infer the general functionality based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates on multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `y` where 0 <= x, y <= 99. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific return values are not provided in the constraints.**
