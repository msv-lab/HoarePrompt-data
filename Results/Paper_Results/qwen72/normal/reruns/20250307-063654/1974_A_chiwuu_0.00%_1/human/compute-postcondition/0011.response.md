Output State: **`t` is an integer such that if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5 + 1. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `t1` = `t` * 15 - `b` * 4.**

Explanation:
- `t1` is assigned the value of `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The value of `t` is determined based on the initial condition: if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5; otherwise, `t` = `b` * 2 // 5 + 1.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
