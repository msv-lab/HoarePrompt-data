Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified the steps and logic of the program. However, it pointed out a critical error in the calculation of the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. The original program uses `t = b * 2` to calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, which is incorrect. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so the correct calculation should be `t = b * 4`.

Let's break down the corrected logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons: `t = b * 4`.
   - It then determines the number of screens needed for these icons:
     - `if t % 15 == 0`, then `t = t // 15` gives the exact number of screens needed.
     - `if t % 15 != 0`, then `t = t // 15 + 1` adds one more screen to accommodate the remaining cells.

3. **Calculating the Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - `t1` is the number of cells left on the screens.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then the remaining space is enough to place all the 1x1 icons, and no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1 < a`, then additional screens are needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - `t2 = a - t1` calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
   - `if t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15` adds the exact number of additional screens needed.
   - `if t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` adds one more screen to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

The corrected program logic is as follows:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 4  # Correct calculation for 2x2 icons
        if t % 15 == 0:
            t = t // 15
        else:
            t = t // 15 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Validation of the Corrected Program:
Let's validate the corrected program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case: (1, 1)**
   - `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `t = 1 * 4 = 4`
   - `t % 15 == 4`, so `t = 4 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
   - `t1 >= 1`, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Output: `1`

2. **Test Case: (7, 2)**
   - `a = 7`, `b = 2`
   - `t = 2 * 4 = 8`
   - `t % 15 == 8`, so `t = 8 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
   - `t1 == 7`, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Output: `1`

3. **Test Case: (12, 4)**
   - `a = 12`, `b = 4`
   - `t = 4 * 4 = 16`
   - `t % 15 == 1`, so `t = 16 // 15 + 1 = 2`
   - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 2`
   - `t1 < 12`, so additional screens are needed.
   - `t2 = 12 - 2 = 10`
   - `t2 % 15 == 10`, so `t = 2 + 10 // 15 + 1 = 3`
   - Output: `2` (The original output was 2, but the corrected output should be 3. This indicates a potential issue in the original assessment.)

4. **Test Case: (0, 3)**
   - `a = 0`, `b = 3`
   - `t = 3 * 4 = 12`
   - `t % 15 == 12`, so `t = 12 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 3`
   - `t1 >= 0`, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Output: `1`

5. **Test Case: (1, 0)**
   - `a = 1`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `t % 15 == 0`, so `t = 0 // 15 = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `t1 < 1`, so additional screens are needed.
   - `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1`
   - `t2 % 15 == 1`, so `t = 0 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

6. **Test Case: (8, 1)**
   - `a = 8`, `b = 1`
   - `t = 1 * 4 = 4`
   - `t % 15 == 4`, so `t = 4 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
   - `t1 >= 8`, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Output: `1`

7. **Test Case: (0, 0)**
   - `a = 0`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `t % 15 == 0`, so `t = 0 // 15 = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `t1 >= 0`, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Output: `0`

8. **Test Case: (2, 0)**
   - `a = 2`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `t % 15 == 0`, so `t = 0 // 15 = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `t1 < 2`, so additional screens are needed.
   - `t2 = 2 - 0 = 2`
   - `t2 % 15 == 2`, so `t = 0 + 2 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

9. **Test Case: (15, 0)**
   - `a = 15`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `t % 15 == 0`, so `t = 0 // 15 = 0`
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
   - `t1 < 15`, so additional screens are needed.
   - `t2 = 15 - 0 = 15`
   - `t2 % 15 == 0`, so `t = 0 + 15 // 15 = 1`
   - Output: `1`

10. **Test Case: (8, 2)**
    - `a = 8`, `b = 2`
    - `t = 2 * 4
