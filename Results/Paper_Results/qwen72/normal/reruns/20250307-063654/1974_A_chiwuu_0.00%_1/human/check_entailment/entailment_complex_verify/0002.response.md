### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates `t = b * 2`. This is incorrect because `b` represents the number of 2x2 icons, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Therefore, the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons should be `b * 4`.
   - The correct calculation should be `t = b * 4`.
   - The program then checks if `t % 5 == 0` to determine if the total number of 2x2 icons can be perfectly placed in the screens without any remainder.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t = t // 5` gives the exact number of screens needed.
   - If `t % 5 != 0`, then `t = t // 5 + 1` adds one more screen to accommodate the remaining icons.

3. **Calculating the Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - `t1` is the number of cells left on the screens.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then the remaining space is enough to place all the 1x1 icons, and no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1 < a`, then additional screens are needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - `t2 = a - t1` calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
   - `t2 % 15 == 0` checks if the remaining 1x1 icons can be perfectly placed in the additional screens.
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15` adds the exact number of additional screens needed.
   - If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` adds one more screen to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Specifically, `t = b * 2` should be `t = b * 4` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct output.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 4
        if t % 15 == 0:
            t = t // 15
        else:
            t = t // 15 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified the logical error in the calculation of the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
- The corrected program addresses this issue and should produce the correct output for all test cases.

Final: **False**
