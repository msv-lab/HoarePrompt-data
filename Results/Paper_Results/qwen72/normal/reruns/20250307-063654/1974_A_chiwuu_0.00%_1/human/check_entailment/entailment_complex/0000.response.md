### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b * 2`. This is because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns). Therefore, `b * 2` gives the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons, assuming each 2x2 icon occupies 2 screens.
   - The function then checks if `t % 5 == 0`. If true, it sets `t` to `t // 5`, which is the number of full screens required to place all 2x2 icons. If false, it sets `t` to `t // 5 + 1`, which accounts for any remaining cells that would require an additional screen.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the total number of cells available on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - The function checks if `t1 >= a`. If true, it means there are enough cells left to place all 1x1 icons, and `t` remains unchanged.
   - If false, it calculates the remaining number of 1x1 icons that need to be placed (`t2 = a - t1`). It then checks if `t2 % 15 == 0`. If true, it adds `t2 // 15` to `t`, which is the number of additional screens required to place the remaining 1x1 icons. If false, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` to `t` to account for any remaining cells that would require an additional screen.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the final value of `t` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of screens required to place all icons.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so `t` is correctly calculated to ensure all 2x2 icons fit.
- The logic for calculating the remaining space and placing 1x1 icons is also correct. It correctly checks if there are enough cells left and adds the necessary screens to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem description and input constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
