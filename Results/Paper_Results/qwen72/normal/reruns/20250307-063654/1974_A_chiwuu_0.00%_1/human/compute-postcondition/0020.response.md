Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5 + 1. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`, and `t2` remains divisible by 15. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, and `t2` is not divisible by 15. In both cases, `t1` is updated to `t` * 15 - `b` * 4 and `t1` is less than `a`, and `t2` is updated to `a` - `t1`.***
