Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the variables retain their values. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`.***
