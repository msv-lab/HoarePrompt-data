To determine the value of `t` that will be printed, we need to follow the logic described in the initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- Otherwise, if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t * 15 + b * 4`.
- If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t` is divisible by 5, or `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t` is not divisible by 5, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t` is an integer.
   - `a` and `b` are integers.
   - `t1` and `t2` are not explicitly defined at the start, so we need to follow the conditions to determine their values.

2. **Condition 1: `t1 >= a`**
   - If this condition is true, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - However, since `t1` is not defined initially, we need to check the other conditions to see if they provide a value for `t1`.

3. **Condition 2: `t2 % 15 == 0`**
   - If this condition is true, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`.
   - `t1` is then calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t * 15 + b * 4`.

4. **Condition 3: `t2 % 15 != 0`**
   - If this condition is true, `t` is updated differently based on whether `t` is divisible by 5.
   - If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - If `t` is not divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - `t1` is then calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.

### Determining the Final Value of `t`:
- Since `t1` and `t2` are not explicitly defined at the start, we need to consider the conditions to see how they are updated.
- The conditions are mutually exclusive, so only one of them will be true.

### Case Analysis:
1. **If `t1 >= a` is true:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - This condition does not update `t`, so the value of `t` remains the same as the initial value.

2. **If `t2 % 15 == 0` is true:**
   - `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`.
   - `t1` is then calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t * 15 + b * 4`.

3. **If `t2 % 15 != 0` is true:**
   - `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t` is divisible by 5, or `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t` is not divisible by 5.
   - `t1` is then calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `t` that will be printed depends on the initial values of `t`, `a`, and `b`, and the conditions described.
- Since the exact initial values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the value of `t` in terms of these variables and the conditions.

Output: **t (where t is the integer value after the conditions are applied based on the initial values of t, a, and b)**
