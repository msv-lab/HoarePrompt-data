Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons is exactly 15 and there are no 2x2 icons. According to the problem description, a single screen can hold up to 15 icons of size 1x1, so the expected output for the input `(15, 0)` should be `1`. However, the program outputs `2` for this input, which is incorrect. 

To illustrate:
- For the input `(15, 0)`, the program calculates `t = 0` (since `b = 0`), then `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`. Since `t1 < a`, it calculates `t2 = 15 - 0 = 15`. Finally, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2` to `t`, resulting in `t = 2`.

The correct output should be `1` because a single screen can hold all 15 icons of size 1x1.
