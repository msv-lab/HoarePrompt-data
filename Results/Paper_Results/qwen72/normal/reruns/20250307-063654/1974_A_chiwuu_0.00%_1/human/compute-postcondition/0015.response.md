Output State: **`t` is an integer such that if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5 + 1. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` = `t` * 15 - `b` * 4, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` = `a` - `t1`.**

The code snippet `t2 = a - t1` assigns the value of `a` minus `t1` to the variable `t2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `t2`, which is `a` - `t1`.
