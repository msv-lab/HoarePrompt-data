Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**

The code converts the string `b` to an integer and assigns it back to `b`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged.
