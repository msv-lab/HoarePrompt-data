Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, where `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- Therefore, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`, which simplifies to `a - t * 15 + b * 4`.
- The expression `(t2 // 15)` evaluates to `(a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`.
- Thus, `t` becomes `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`.
- The states of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged.
