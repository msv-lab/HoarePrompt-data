Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an integer that has been updated based on the logic within the loop for each of the `n` iterations. The values of `x` and `y` remain integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, and `n` is the input integer that determines the number of iterations. The loop variable `i` will be `n - 1` after the last iteration. For each iteration, `a` and `b` are read from input, and `t` is updated as follows:**

1. `t` is initially set to `b * 2`.
2. If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `t // 5`.
3. If `t` is not divisible by 5, `t` is updated to `t // 5 + 1`.
4. `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
5. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
6. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
7. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
8. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

**The final value of `t` is the result of these updates for each of the `n` iterations, and it is printed after each iteration.**
