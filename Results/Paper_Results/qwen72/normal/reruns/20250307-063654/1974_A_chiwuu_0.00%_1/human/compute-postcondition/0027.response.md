Output State: **`t` is `b * 2`, `t` is an integer such that if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b * 2 // 5`. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**

Explanation:
- `t` is now assigned the value `b * 2`.
- The condition for `t` being divisible by 5 or not is still valid, but the value of `t` is now `b * 2`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
