To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer.
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` is an integer.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `t1` is calculated as \(t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4\).

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the variables retain their values.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is calculated as \(t2 = a - t1\).
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to \(t + \frac{a - t1}{15}\).
   - Otherwise, `t` is updated to \(t + \frac{a - t \times 15 + b \times 4}{15} + 1\).

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - Calculate `t1` using the formula \(t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4\).
   - Check if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`:
     - If true, `t` remains unchanged.
     - If false, proceed to the next steps.
   - Calculate `t2` using the formula \(t2 = a - t1\).
   - Check if `t2 % 15 == 0`:
     - If true, update `t` to \(t + \frac{a - t1}{15}\).
     - If false, update `t` to \(t + \frac{a - t \times 15 + b \times 4}{15} + 1\).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `t` will be printed.
   - The exact value of `t` depends on the initial values of `t`, `a`, and `b`, and the conditions described.

Given the complexity and the dependency on the initial values, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **t (where t is the value of t after the conditions are applied)**

To provide a more precise description:
- If \(t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4 \geq a\), then `t` remains unchanged.
- If \(t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4 < a\):
  - If \(t2 = a - t1\) is divisible by 15, then `t` is updated to \(t + \frac{a - t1}{15}\).
  - Otherwise, `t` is updated to \(t + \frac{a - t \times 15 + b \times 4}{15} + 1\).

Thus, the final output will be the value of `t` after these conditions are evaluated.
