The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. Otherwise, if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t * 15 + b * 4`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t` is divisible by 5, or `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t` is not divisible by 5, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**
