Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged, and all the initial conditions and variable values are still valid. The value of `t1` is still `t * 15 - b * 4`.
