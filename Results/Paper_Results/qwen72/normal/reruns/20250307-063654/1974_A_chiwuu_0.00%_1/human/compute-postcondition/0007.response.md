Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` = `b` * 2 // 5, `t` is divisible by 5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5`, which means `t` is now the integer division of the original `t` by 5.
- Since `t` was originally `b * 2` and divisible by 5, the new value of `t` will still be an integer and will be `b * 2 // 5`.
- The other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
