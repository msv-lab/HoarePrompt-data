### Reasoning

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify it against the problem description and the provided test cases.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Initial Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to the number of screens required to fit all 2x2 icons.
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).
   - The number of screens required for `b` 2x2 icons is calculated as:
     ```python
     t = b * 2
     if t % 5 == 0:
         t = t // 5
     else:
         t = t // 5 + 1
     ```
   - This calculation is correct because:
     - `b * 2` gives the total number of rows required to fit `b` 2x2 icons.
     - `t % 5 == 0` checks if the total rows are a multiple of 5 (i.e., fit perfectly into screens).
     - If not, `t // 5 + 1` ensures that we account for the partial screen.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as the total number of cells available on `t` screens minus the cells occupied by 2x2 icons:
     ```python
     t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
     ```
   - This is correct because:
     - `t * 15` gives the total number of cells on `t` screens.
     - `b * 4` gives the total number of cells occupied by `b` 2x2 icons.

4. **Checking if Remaining Cells Can Fit 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `t1` (remaining cells) is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), then `t` is already the correct number of screens.
   - Otherwise, the remaining 1x1 icons are calculated as `t2 = a - t1`.
   - The number of additional screens required for `t2` 1x1 icons is calculated as:
     ```python
     if t2 % 15 == 0:
         t = t + t2 // 15
     else:
         t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
     ```
   - This is correct because:
     - `t2 // 15` gives the number of full screens required for `t2` 1x1 icons.
     - If `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t2 // 15 + 1` ensures that we account for the partial screen.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of screens `t` for each test case.

### Verification of the Original Assessment

The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons is exactly 15 and there are no 2x2 icons. Let's verify this:

- For the input `(15, 0)`, the program should output `1` because a single screen can hold all 15 icons of size 1x1.
- The program's behavior is as follows:
  - `b = 0`, so `t = 0`.
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
  - Since `t1 < a`, `t2 = 15 - 0 = 15`.
  - `t2 % 15 == 0`, so `t = 0 + 15 // 15 = 1`.

The program actually outputs `1` for the input `(15, 0)`, which is correct. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

The program correctly handles the case where the number of 1x1 icons is exactly 15 and there are no 2x2 icons. It also correctly handles other test cases as per the provided function summary and the problem description.

Final: **True**
