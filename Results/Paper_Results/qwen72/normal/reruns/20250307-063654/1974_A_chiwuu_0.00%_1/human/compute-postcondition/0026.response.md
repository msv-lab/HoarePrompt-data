The value of `b` is converted to an integer using the `int()` function. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5 + 1. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**
