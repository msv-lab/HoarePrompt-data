Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons, but it contains a logical error in how it handles the placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

1. **Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required to place all the 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. Therefore, the number of screens required for `b` 2x2 icons is `b * 4 // 15 + (b * 4 % 15 > 0)`, which is equivalent to the logic in the program.

2. **Calculation of Remaining Cells:**
   - The program calculates the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This is correct.

3. **Placement of 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program then checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place all the 1x1 icons (`if t1 >= a`). If they are, it correctly prints the number of screens `t`.
   - However, if the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons as `t2 = a - t1` and then `t = t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 > 0)`. This logic is incorrect because it assumes that the remaining cells on the current screens cannot be used to place the 1x1 icons, which is not always true.

### Correct Approach:
- After placing the 2x2 icons, calculate the remaining cells on the current screens.
- If the remaining cells are not enough to place all the 1x1 icons, calculate the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.
- The correct formula for the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons should be `t2 = (a - t1 + 14) // 15`, which ensures that any remaining cells are accounted for.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15  # Calculate screens needed for 2x2 icons
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4  # Calculate remaining cells
        if t1 >= a:
            print(t)
        else:
            t2 = (a - t1 + 14) // 15  # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
            print(t + t2)
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum number of screens required for all test cases.
