Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the number of test cases.
   - Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99), representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.

3. **Constraints:**
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, so it has 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of screens.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - `t = b * 2` is the total number of 2x2 icons, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - `t % 5 == 0` checks if the total number of 2x2 icons can be perfectly placed in the screens without any remainder.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t = t // 5` gives the exact number of screens needed.
   - If `t % 5 != 0`, then `t = t // 5 + 1` adds one more screen to accommodate the remaining icons.

3. **Calculating the Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - `t1` is the number of cells left on the screens.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then the remaining space is enough to place all the 1x1 icons, and no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1 < a`, then additional screens are needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - `t2 = a - t1` calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
   - `t2 % 15 == 0` checks if the remaining 1x1 icons can be perfectly placed in the additional screens.
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15` adds the exact number of additional screens needed.
   - If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` adds one more screen to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
- It then correctly calculates the remaining space on these screens.
- If the remaining space is not enough for the 1x1 icons, it correctly calculates the additional screens needed.
- The logic for handling the remainder of the 1x1 icons is also correct.

However, there is a small issue in the calculation of `t` for the 2x2 icons. The program should calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons based on the number of cells they occupy, not the number of icons. Specifically, `t = b * 4` should be used instead of `t = b * 2`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 4
        if t % 15 == 0:
            t = t // 15
        else:
            t = t // 15 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
- The corrected program should be used to ensure the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
