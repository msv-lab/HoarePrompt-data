Let's break down the initial state and the logic to determine the value of `t` that will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer that depends on `b`:
  - If `t` is divisible by 5, then `t = b * 2 // 5`.
  - If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t = b * 2 // 5 + 1`.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers.

### Logic:
1. Calculate `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
2. Check if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`:
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, then:
     - Calculate `t2` as `a - t1`.
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, update `t` to `t + t2 // 15`.
     - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, update `t` to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
     - Update `t1` to `t * 15 - b * 4` and `t2` to `a - t1`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initial Calculation of `t`:**
   - If `b * 2 // 5` is divisible by 5, then `t = b * 2 // 5`.
   - If `b * 2 // 5` is not divisible by 5, then `t = b * 2 // 5 + 1`.

2. **Calculate `t1`:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Check if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` remains as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1 < a`, then:
     - Calculate `t2` as `a - t1`.
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, update `t` to `t + t2 // 15`.
     - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, update `t` to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
     - Update `t1` to `t * 15 - b * 4` and `t2` to `a - t1`.

4. **Final Value of `t`:**
   - The value of `t` will be updated based on the conditions described above.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `t`. However, based on the given logic, the value of `t` will be determined as follows:
- Initially, `t` is calculated as `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` depending on whether `b * 2 // 5` is divisible by 5.
- If `t1` is less than `a`, `t` will be updated to `t + t2 // 15` or `t + t2 // 15 + 1` depending on whether `t2` is divisible by 15.

Therefore, the final value of `t` will be:
- `t` if `t1 >= a`.
- `t + t2 // 15` if `t1 < a` and `t2` is divisible by 15.
- `t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t1 < a` and `t2` is not divisible by 15.

Output: **t (where t is the final value of t after the described logic is applied)**
