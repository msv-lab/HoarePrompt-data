To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, as `i` will start from 0 and increment up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
- `n` is an input integer.

The only variables that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
