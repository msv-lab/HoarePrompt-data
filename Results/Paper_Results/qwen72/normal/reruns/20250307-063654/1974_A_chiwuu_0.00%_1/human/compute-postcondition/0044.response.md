Output State: **`t` is equal to `(b * 2) // 5`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**

The value of `t` is updated to be the integer division of its previous value by 5. The previous value of `t` was `b * 2`, so the new value of `t` is `(b * 2) // 5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
