Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the number of 1x1 icons `a` and 2x2 icons `b`.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons by multiplying `b` by 2 (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so `b * 2` gives the number of 2x2 icons in terms of 5x3 screens).
   - It then checks if `t` (the number of screens required for 2x2 icons) is divisible by 5. If it is, it sets `t` to `t // 5`, otherwise, it sets `t` to `t // 5 + 1`. This calculation is correct because each screen can hold 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so `b * 2` gives the total number of 2x2 icons in terms of screens, and the division by 5 with ceiling ensures that we account for any remaining cells that would require an additional screen.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This is correct because `t * 15` gives the total number of cells in the screens required for 2x2 icons, and `b * 4` gives the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.

4. **Check if Remaining Cells Can Fit 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program checks if the remaining cells `t1` are sufficient to fit all the 1x1 icons `a`. If `t1 >= a`, it means the current number of screens `t` is sufficient, and no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1 < a`, it calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`. It then checks if `t2` is divisible by 15 (the total number of cells in one screen). If it is, it adds `t2 // 15` to `t`, otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` to `t`. This ensures that any remaining cells that do not fit into a full screen are accounted for by adding an additional screen.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case, which is the final value of `t`.

The logic and calculations in the program are correct and align with the problem description. The program handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons efficiently and calculates the minimum number of screens required.

Correctness: **True**
