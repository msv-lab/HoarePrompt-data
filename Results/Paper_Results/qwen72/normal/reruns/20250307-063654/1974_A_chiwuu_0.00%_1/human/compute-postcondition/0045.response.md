Output State: **`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**

The value of `t` is updated to be the result of `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
