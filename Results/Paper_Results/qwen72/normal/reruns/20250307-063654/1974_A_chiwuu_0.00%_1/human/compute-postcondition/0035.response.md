Output State: **`t` is an integer such that if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b * 2 // 5 + t2 // 15 + 1`. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
- The value of `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- If `t` was initially divisible by 5, then `t` was `b * 2 // 5`. After the update, `t` becomes `b * 2 // 5 + t2 // 15 + 1`.
- If `t` was initially not divisible by 5, then `t` was `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. After the update, `t` becomes `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged.
