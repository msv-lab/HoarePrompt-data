Output State: **`t` is an integer such that if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b * 2 // 5`. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.** 

The value of `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is determined based on the initial condition provided, and `t1` is derived from this value of `t` and the value of `b`.
