Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t * 15 + b * 4`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- Therefore, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`, which simplifies to `a - t * 15 + b * 4`.
- The new value of `t` is `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged.
