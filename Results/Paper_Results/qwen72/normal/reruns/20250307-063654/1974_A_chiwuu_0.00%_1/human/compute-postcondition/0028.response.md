Output State: **`t` is `b * 2 // 5`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is `b * 2` and if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b * 2 // 5`. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.
- The code `t = t // 5` updates `t` to be the integer division of `t` by 5.
- If `t` was originally `b * 2` and divisible by 5, then `t` was `b * 2 // 5`, and after the code execution, `t` becomes `b * 2 // 5 // 5` which simplifies to `b * 2 // 25`.
- If `t` was originally `b * 2` and not divisible by 5, then `t` was `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, and after the code execution, `t` becomes `(b * 2 // 5 + 1) // 5`. Since `b * 2 // 5 + 1` is not divisible by 5, the result of the integer division will be the same as `b * 2 // 25`.
- Therefore, in both cases, `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`.
- The states of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
