The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then calculates and prints an integer `t` for each test case, where `t` is determined based on the values of `a` and `b` through a series of arithmetic operations and conditions. The final value of `t` is such that it satisfies the conditions within the function, and it is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value.
