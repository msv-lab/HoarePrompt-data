Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is a string representing the input value.**

The code snippet `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` to an integer and assigns it back to `a`. The other variables and their constraints remain unchanged.
