Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`, `t1` = `t` * 15 - `b` * 4, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` = `a` - `t1`, and `t2` is divisible by 15. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The expressions for `t1` and `t2` are still valid, and `t1` is less than `a`, while `t2` is divisible by 15.
