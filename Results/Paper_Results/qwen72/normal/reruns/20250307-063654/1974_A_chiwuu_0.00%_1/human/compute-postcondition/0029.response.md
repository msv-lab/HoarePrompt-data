Output State: **`t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5 + 1`.
- Since `t` was initially defined as `b * 2` and then modified to `b * 2 // 5` if divisible by 5, or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` if not divisible by 5, the new value of `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
