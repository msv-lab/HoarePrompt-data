Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b * 2
    if t % 5 == 0:
        t = t // 5
    else:
        t = t // 5 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5 + 1. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, and `b` is an integer. If `t1` = `t` * 15 - `b` * 4 is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains as `t` * 15 - `b` * 4. Otherwise, if `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`, and `t2` remains divisible by 15. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, and `t2` is not divisible by 15. In both cases where `t1` is less than `a`, `t1` is updated to `t` * 15 - `b` * 4 and `t2` is updated to `a` - `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. Otherwise, if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t * 15 + b * 4`. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, then `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t` is divisible by 5, or `b * 2 // 5 + 1 + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t` is not divisible by 5, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the variables retain their values. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
