Output State: **`t` is an integer such that if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b * 2 // 5`. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- `t2` is assigned the value of `a - t1`.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `t` (whether it is divisible by 5 or not) still holds.
- The values of `x` and `y` are still within the range 0 to 99.
- `n` is still greater than 1.
- `i` is still 1.
- `a` and `b` are still integers.
- `t1` is still `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t2` is now `a - t1`.
