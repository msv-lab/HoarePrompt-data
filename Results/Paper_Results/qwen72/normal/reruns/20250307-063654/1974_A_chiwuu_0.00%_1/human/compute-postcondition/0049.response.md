Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- `t2` is assigned the value `a - t1`.
- `t1` is already calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The value of `t2` is now `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.
