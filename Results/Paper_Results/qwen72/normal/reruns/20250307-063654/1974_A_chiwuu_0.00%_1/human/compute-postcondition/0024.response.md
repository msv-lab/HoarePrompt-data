Output State: **`t` is an integer such that if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5 + 1. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `a` and `b` are updated to the values provided by the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, b = input().split()` updates the values of `a` and `b` to the values provided by the user input.
- The input values are split and assigned to `a` and `b`.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The conditions and relationships involving `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` from the initial state are still valid.
- The new values of `a` and `b` are now the values provided by the input.
