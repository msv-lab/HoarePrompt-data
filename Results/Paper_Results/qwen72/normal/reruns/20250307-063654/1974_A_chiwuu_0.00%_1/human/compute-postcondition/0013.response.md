Output State: **`t` is an integer such that if `t` is divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5. If `t` is not divisible by 5, then `t` = `b` * 2 // 5 + 1. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99. `n` is greater than 0. `i` is 0. `a` is an integer. `b` is an integer. `t1` = `t` * 15 - `b` * 4, and the current value of `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. Therefore, all the initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
