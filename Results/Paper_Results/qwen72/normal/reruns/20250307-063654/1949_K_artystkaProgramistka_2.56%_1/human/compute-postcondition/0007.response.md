The only objects in the loop head are the variables `num` and the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must have at least one more element after the current `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the second element in the `numbers` list, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order with `n` ≥ 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `numbers` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` ≥ 3, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `num` is the third element in the `numbers` list, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been called.**
