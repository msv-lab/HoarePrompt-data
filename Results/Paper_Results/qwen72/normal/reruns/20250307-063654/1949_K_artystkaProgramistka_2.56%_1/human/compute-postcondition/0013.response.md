Output State: **The program returns 'NO'.** 

This means that the function has evaluated the conditions and, based on the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, it has determined that the result is 'NO'. This could indicate that the distribution of numbers into the groups did not meet a specific criterion or requirement that was being checked by `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)`.
