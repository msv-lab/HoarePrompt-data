The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must have at least one more element, and `num` will be the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n` ≥ 1.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.
- `num` is the first element in the `numbers` list.
- `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.
- `sum_a` is 0.
- `sum_b` is 0.
- `sum_c` is 0.
- The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `numbers` must have at least 2 elements (since one element has already been processed).
- `num` will be the second element in the `numbers` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` ≥ 2, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `num` is the second element in the `numbers` list, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been called.**
