The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. 

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer `x_i` is in the range 1 to 10^9.

The function returns one of two cases:

- **Case_1**: If the function can partition the `numbers` list into three sublists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` such that the sum of elements in `group_a` is `sum_a`, the sum of elements in `group_b` is `sum_b`, and the sum of elements in `group_c` is `sum_c`, and the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true, then the function returns 'YES' along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`.
- **Case_2**: If the function cannot satisfy the condition in Case_1, it returns 'NO'.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It returns 'YES' and three lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if the elements of `numbers` can be partitioned into these three groups such that the sum of elements in each group satisfies a condition defined by `func_1`. If no such partition exists, it returns 'NO'.**
