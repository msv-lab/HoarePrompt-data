Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` â‰¥ 1, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing elements from `numbers` such that the sum of elements in `group_a` is `sum_a`, the sum of elements in `group_b` is `sum_b`, and the sum of elements in `group_c` is `sum_c`, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been called for each element in `numbers`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer, and the list `numbers` still contains `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.
- The lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are no longer empty. They each contain some elements from the `numbers` list, distributed according to the `distribute_number` function.
- The variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` now hold the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, respectively.
- The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called for each element in the `numbers` list, ensuring that all elements have been processed and distributed among the three groups.
