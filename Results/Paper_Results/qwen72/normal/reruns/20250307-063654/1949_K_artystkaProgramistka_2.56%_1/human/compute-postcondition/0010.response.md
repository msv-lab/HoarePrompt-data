Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` â‰¥ 1, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing elements from `numbers` such that the sum of elements in `group_a` is `sum_a`, the sum of elements in `group_b` is `sum_b`, and the sum of elements in `group_c` is `sum_c`, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been called for each element in `numbers`. Additionally, the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true.**
