The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and attempts to distribute the elements into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`). If the sums of the elements in these groups (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`) satisfy a condition defined by `func_1`, the function returns 'YES' along with the three groups. If the condition is not satisfied, the function returns 'NO'. The `numbers` list is modified to be sorted in descending order, and the three groups are populated with elements from `numbers`.
