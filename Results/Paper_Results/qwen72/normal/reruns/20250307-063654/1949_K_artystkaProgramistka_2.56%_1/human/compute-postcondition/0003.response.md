The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute, `numbers` must be a non-empty list. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `num` will be the first element in the `numbers` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` â‰¥ 1, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, `num` is the first element in the `numbers` list, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists, `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0**
