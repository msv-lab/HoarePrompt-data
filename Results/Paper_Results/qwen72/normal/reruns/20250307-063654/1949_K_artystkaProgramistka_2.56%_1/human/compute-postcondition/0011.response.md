Output State: **The program returns 'YES' along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. These lists contain elements from the original `numbers` list, which is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order. The sum of elements in `group_a` is `sum_a`, the sum of elements in `group_b` is `sum_b`, and the sum of elements in `group_c` is `sum_c`. The condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` is true.**
