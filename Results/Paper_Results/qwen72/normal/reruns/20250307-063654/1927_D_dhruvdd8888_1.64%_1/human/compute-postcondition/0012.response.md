Postcondition: ***`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the first element of `nums`, and `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)` and the first element of `nums` is not equal to `num`.***
