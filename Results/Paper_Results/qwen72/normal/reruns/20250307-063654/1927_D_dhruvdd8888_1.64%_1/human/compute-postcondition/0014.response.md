The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `N + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `N` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `N` must still be at least 0 to ensure `i < N + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the first element of `nums`, and `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)` and the first element of `nums` is not equal to `num`.**
