Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. One specific issue is in the logic for handling the queries. The program uses a binary search to find the first interval where the numbers are different, but it does not correctly handle cases where the query range is entirely within a segment of the same number. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```

The expected output is `-1 -1` because all elements in the range [1, 5] are the same. However, the program will output `1 2`, which is incorrect. The program should correctly identify that no such pair exists within the given range.
