To determine what will be printed by the `print(l, r)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State:
- `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
- `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
- `eli` is the index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
- `tc` is a variable that is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
- `ppp` is set to 23 if `tc` > 5.
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `num` is `-1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Input Variables**:
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input. Their values are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but they are provided as part of the input.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The condition `if tc > 5` affects the value of `ppp`. If `tc` > 5, `ppp` is set to 23. However, since `tc` is not defined, we cannot determine whether this condition is true or false.
   - The `continue` statement is only relevant if `tc` > 5, and it would cause the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop. However, this does not affect the values of `l` and `r` that are printed.

3. **Tuple Segments**:
   - `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. However, the exact values of `s` and `e` are not needed to determine what `print(l, r)` will output.

### Conclusion:
The `print(l, r)` statement will print the values of `l` and `r` as they are obtained from the input. The values of `l` and `r` are not modified by the conditions or the tuple segments described in the initial state.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the integers obtained from the input)**
