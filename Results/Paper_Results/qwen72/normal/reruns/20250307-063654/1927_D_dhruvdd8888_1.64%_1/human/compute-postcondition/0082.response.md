Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `eli` is the index returned by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `num` is `-1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1, which means it is the last valid index of `arr`.
   - `eli` is the index returned by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`. This function returns the position in `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would fit to maintain the sorted order of the list.
   - `min(eli, LA)` ensures that the index used to access `arr` does not exceed the last valid index.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - The `print` statement outputs `s - 1` and `s`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `arr` contains tuples representing segments of the `nums` list, `s` is the starting index of a segment in `nums`.
   - The `print` statement will output `s - 1` and `s`.

Given the initial state and the structure of the problem, the output will be:
Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the starting index of the segment in `nums` at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`)**
