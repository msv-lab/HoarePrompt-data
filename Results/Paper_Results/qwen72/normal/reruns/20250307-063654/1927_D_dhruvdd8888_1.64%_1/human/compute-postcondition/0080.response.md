Output State: **`N` is an integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `eli` is the index returned by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, `tc` and `ppp` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]` updates the values of `s` and `e` based on the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
- `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
- The third element of the tuple is ignored (denoted by `_`).
- All other variables (`N`, `nums`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `tc`, `ppp`) remain unchanged.
