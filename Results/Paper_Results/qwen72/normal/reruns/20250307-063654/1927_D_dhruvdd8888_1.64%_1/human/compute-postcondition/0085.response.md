Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
2. `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
3. `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
4. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
5. `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
6. `eli` is the index returned by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
7. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
8. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
9. `num` is `-1`.
10. `tc` and `ppp` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s, e + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`N` and `nums`**:
   - `N` is the length of the input list `nums` before appending `-1`.
   - `nums` is the list of integers from the input with `-1` appended at the end.

2. **`arr`**:
   - `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value. For example, if `nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, -1]`, then `arr` might look like `[(0, 1), (2, 4), (5, 5)]`, where each tuple `(start, end)` represents the start and end indices of a segment of the same value in `nums`.

3. **`LA`**:
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last valid index of the `arr` list.

4. **`l` and `r`**:
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, representing some range or indices.

5. **`eli`**:
   - `eli` is the index returned by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`. This function finds the position in `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would fit in a sorted order. Since `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments, `bisect_left` will return the index of the first segment that starts at or after `l`.

6. **`s` and `e`**:
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

7. **`print(s, e + 1)`**:
   - The `print` statement will output the values of `s` and `e + 1`.

### Determining the Output:
- **`s` and `e`**:
  - `s` and `e` are the start and end indices of the segment in `nums` that contains the same value and starts at or after the index `l`.
  - If `eli` is greater than `LA`, `min(eli, LA)` will ensure that we use the last segment in `arr`.

- **`e + 1`**:
  - `e + 1` will give the next index after the end of the segment.

### Example:
Suppose `nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, -1]` and `arr = [(0, 1), (2, 4), (5, 5)]`.
- If `l = 2` and `r = 4`, `bisect_left(arr, (2, 0, 0))` will return `1` because the segment starting at index 2 is the second tuple in `arr`.
- `min(1, 2) = 1`.
- `s` will be `2` (the start index of the segment).
- `e` will be `4` (the end index of the segment).
- `e + 1` will be `5`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2, 5 (where 2 is the start index of the segment in `nums` that starts at or after `l`, and 5 is the next index after the end of that segment)**
