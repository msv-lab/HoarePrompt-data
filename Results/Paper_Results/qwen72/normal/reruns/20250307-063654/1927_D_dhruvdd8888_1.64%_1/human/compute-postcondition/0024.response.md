Output State: **`N` is an integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, and `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value. Each tuple is in the form `(start_index + 1, end_index, value)` where `start_index` is the index of the first occurrence of the value in the segment, and `end_index` is the index of the last occurrence of the value in the segment before a different value appears.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `N` remains the same as the input integer.
- The list `nums` remains the same as the input list with `-1` appended to the end.
- The variable `s` is now equal to `N`, which is the last index of the `nums` list.
- The variable `e` remains 0, as it is not modified in the loop.
- The variable `num` is now `-1`, which is the last element of the `nums` list.
- The list `arr` contains tuples that describe segments of the `nums` list where each segment consists of consecutive elements with the same value. Each tuple in `arr` is of the form `(start_index + 1, end_index, value)`, where `start_index` is the index of the first element in the segment, `end_index` is the index of the last element in the segment before a different value appears, and `value` is the value of the elements in that segment.
