Output State: **The initial state remains unchanged. `input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.readline`, which is a function that reads a line from standard input.**

The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, and the query pairs `(l, r)` retain their original properties and constraints. The only change is that `input` now refers to the `readline` method of `sys.stdin`, which is used to read input from the standard input stream.
