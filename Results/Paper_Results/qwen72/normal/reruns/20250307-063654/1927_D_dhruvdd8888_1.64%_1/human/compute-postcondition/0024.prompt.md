Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is an integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the first element of `nums`, `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the first element of `nums`, and `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)` and the first element of `nums` is not equal to `num`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 1, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the second element of `nums`. If the second element of `nums` is not equal to the first element of `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1, first element of nums)`. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to the second element of `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 2, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the third element of `nums`. If the second element of `nums` is not equal to the first element of `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 1, first element of nums)` and `(2, 2, second element of nums)`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(2, 2, second element of `nums`)` if the first element of `nums` is equal to the second element of `nums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
