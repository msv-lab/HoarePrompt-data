The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `nums` from the standard input. It then processes a series of queries, each consisting of two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, the function determines the segment of `nums` that contains the same value and intersects with the range `[l, r]`. If such a segment exists, it returns the start and end indices of the segment. If no such segment exists, it returns `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return a list of results; instead, it prints the results directly to the standard output for each query. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged values of `N`, `nums`, and `arr`, and the last processed values of `l` and `r`.
