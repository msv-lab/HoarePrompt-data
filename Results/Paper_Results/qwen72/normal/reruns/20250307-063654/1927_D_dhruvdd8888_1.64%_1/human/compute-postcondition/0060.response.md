Output State: **`N` is an integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `eli` is the index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`. If `ppp` is 23, then if `s` > `l`, `s` is greater than `l`, and if `s` is 1, it is greater than `l`. If `s` <= `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`. Additionally, if `e` >= `r`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`. Otherwise, if `e` < `r` and `e` < `N`, then `e` is less than `r` and `N`. If `e` >= `N`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `N`. If `ppp` is not 23, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain valid.
