The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a`: a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the list.
- `q`: an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries.
- `queries`: a list of pairs of integers (l, r) where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, representing the queries on the list `a`.

The function processes each query and returns a list of results based on the queries. Each result is derived from the list `a` and the corresponding query (l, r).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, and `queries`. It processes `q` queries on the list `a` and returns a list of results for each query.**
