Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
2. `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
3. `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
4. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
5. `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
6. `eli` is the index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
7. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
8. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
9. `num` is `-1`.
10. If `tc` > 5, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
11. `ppp` is set to 23.
12. If `ppp` is 23, then:
    - If `s` > `l`, `s` is greater than `l`.
    - If `s` is 1, it is greater than `l`.
    - If `s` <= `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
    - If `e` >= `r`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.
    - Otherwise, if `e` < `r` and `e` < `N`, then `e` is less than `r` and `N`.
    - If `e` >= `N`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.
13. If `tc` <= 5, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s, e + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `min(eli, LA)`**:
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last valid index of `arr`.
   - `eli` is the index where the first tuple in `arr` with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
   - Therefore, `min(eli, LA)` will be the index of the tuple in `arr` that is either the first one greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` or the last tuple in `arr` if `eli` is out of bounds.

2. **Determine `s` and `e`**:
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

3. **Evaluate the `print` statement**:
   - The `print` statement will output `s` and `e + 1`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e + 1` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` plus 1.

Since the exact values of `s` and `e` depend on the specific input values and the structure of `arr`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr, and e is the second element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
