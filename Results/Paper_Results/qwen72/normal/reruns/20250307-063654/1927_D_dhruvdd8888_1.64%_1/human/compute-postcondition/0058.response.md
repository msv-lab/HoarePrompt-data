To determine what will be printed by the `print(l, r)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `eli` is the index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `tc` > 5, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop, and `ppp` is set to 23.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `num` is `-1`.
   - If `s` > `l`, then `s` is greater than `l`.
   - If `s` is 1, it is greater than `l`.
   - If `s` <= `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - If `e` >= `r`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - Otherwise, if `e` < `r` and `e` < `N`, then `e` is less than `r` and `N`.
   - If `e` >= `N`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(l, r)` statement will print the values of `l` and `r` as they are.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, and their values are not modified by the conditions provided.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the values of `l` and `r` are directly obtained from the input and are not influenced by the other conditions or variables. Therefore, the output will be the values of `l` and `r` as they were provided.

Output: **l, r (where l and r are the integers obtained from the input)**
