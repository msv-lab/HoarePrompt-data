Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `eli` is the index returned by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, and `tc` and `ppp` remain unchanged. If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the program continues with the current values of the variables. If `e` is less than `r`, the program also continues with the current values of the variables.***
