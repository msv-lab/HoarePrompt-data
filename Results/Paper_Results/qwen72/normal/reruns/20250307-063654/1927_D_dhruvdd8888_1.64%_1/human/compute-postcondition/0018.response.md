Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 1, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the second element of `nums`. If the second element of `nums` is not equal to the first element of `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1, first element of nums)`. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to the second element of `nums`.**
