Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the first element of `nums`, and `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, num)` and the first element of `nums` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation:
- The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of the first element of `nums` to `num`.
- Since `i` is 0, `num` is now equal to the first element of `nums`.
- The initial state already specifies that `num` is equal to the first element of `nums`, so this assignment does not change the value of `num`.
- The states of the other variables (`N`, `i`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
