Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
2. `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
3. `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
4. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
5. `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
6. `eli` is the index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
7. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
8. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
9. `num` is `-1`.
10. `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
11. `e` is less than `r`.
12. `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.
13. If `tc` > 5, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
14. `ppp` is set to 23.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- The `print` statement will always print `-1, -1` regardless of the values of `N`, `nums`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `tc`, or `ppp`.

### Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
