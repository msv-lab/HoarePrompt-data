Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
2. `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
3. `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
4. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
5. `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
6. `eli` is the index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
7. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
8. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
9. `num` is `-1`.
10. `s` is greater than `l` and `s` is not equal to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s - 1, s)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `LA`**:
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, which means it is the last valid index of the list `arr`.

2. **Determine `eli`**:
   - `eli` is the index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
   - This means `eli` is the index of the first tuple in `arr` whose first element is greater than or equal to `l`.

3. **Determine `s` and `e`**:
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - Since `s` is greater than `l` and `s` is not equal to 1, we know that `s` is a specific value from the tuple in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(s - 1, s)` statement will print the value of `s - 1` and the value of `s`.

### Final Output:
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and it is greater than `l` and not equal to 1.
- Therefore, `s - 1` is one less than `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and s is greater than l and not equal to 1)**
