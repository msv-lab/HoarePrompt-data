Output State: **`N` is an integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `eli` is the index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`. If `tc` > 5, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop, and `ppp` is set to 23.**
