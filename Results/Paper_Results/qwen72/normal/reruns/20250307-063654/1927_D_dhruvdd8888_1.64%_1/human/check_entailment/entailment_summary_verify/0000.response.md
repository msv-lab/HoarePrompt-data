### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself.
   - It appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.

2. **Segment Identification:**
   - The program iterates through `nums` to identify segments where the elements are the same.
   - It stores these segments in a list `arr` where each segment is represented as a tuple `(start, end, value)`.
   - The segment identification logic is correct and efficiently groups consecutive identical elements.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the first segment that intersects with the query range `[l, r]`.
   - It then checks if the start of the segment is greater than `l`:
     - If `s > l`, it checks if `s == 1` and prints `(-1, -1)` if true, otherwise it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
     - If `s <= l`, it checks if the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to `r`:
       - If `e >= r`, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
       - If `e < r`, it prints `(s, e + 1)`.

4. **Issues in Query Processing:**
   - The program's logic for handling queries is flawed. Specifically, it does not correctly handle cases where the query range is entirely within a segment of the same number.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 1 1 1 1
     1
     1 5
     ```
     - The expected output is `-1 -1` because all elements in the range [1, 5] are the same.
     - However, the program will output `1 2`, which is incorrect.

5. **Specific Flaw:**
   - The program uses the `bisect_left` function to find the first segment that intersects with the query range `[l, r]`.
   - It then checks if the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l` and if the end of the segment `e` is less than `r`.
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that the entire query range `[l, r]` might be within a single segment of identical elements.

6. **Correct Logic:**
   - To correctly handle the queries, the program should:
     - Use `bisect_left` to find the first segment that intersects with the query range `[l, r]`.
     - Use `bisect_right` to find the last segment that intersects with the query range `[l, r]`.
     - Check if the start of the first segment is greater than `l` and the end of the last segment is less than `r`.
     - If the start of the first segment is greater than `l` and the end of the last segment is less than `r`, it should print `(s - 1, s)` or `(e, e + 1)` depending on the conditions.
     - If the entire query range is within a single segment, it should print `(-1, -1)`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when the query range is entirely within a segment of the same number. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
