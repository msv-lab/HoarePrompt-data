Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input. If `tc` > 5, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop, and `ppp` is set to 23.***
