Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `num` is `-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `eli` is the index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
   - If `tc` > 5, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
   - `ppp` is set to 23.
   - If `ppp` is 23, then:
     - If `s` > `l`, `s` is greater than `l`.
     - If `s` is 1, it is greater than `l`.
     - If `s` <= `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
     - If `e` >= `r`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.
     - Otherwise, if `e` < `r` and `e` < `N`, then `e` is less than `r` and `N`.
     - If `e` >= `N`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.
   - If `tc` <= 5, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
   - The values of `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `tc`, and `ppp` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement is hardcoded to print `-1` and `-1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **-1, -1**
