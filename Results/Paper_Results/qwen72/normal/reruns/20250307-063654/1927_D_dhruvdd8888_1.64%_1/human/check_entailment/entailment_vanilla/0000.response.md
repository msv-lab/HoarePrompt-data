Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - The first line contains the length of the array `n`.
     - The second line contains the array `a` of `n` integers.
     - The third line contains the number of queries `q`.
     - The next `q` lines contain the queries `(l, r)`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each query, output two indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i, j <= r` and `a_i != a_j`.
   - If no such pair exists, output `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It iterates over the array to group consecutive elements that are the same into segments and stores these segments in `arr` as tuples `(start, end, value)`.
   - It reads the number of queries and processes each query using `bisect_left` to find the segment that might contain the query range `(l, r)`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, it uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` of the segment that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries:
     - If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the segment starts at the beginning of the array. If so, it outputs `-1 -1`.
     - Otherwise, it outputs the indices `s-1` and `s` where `s` is the start of the segment.
     - If the segment ends before `r`, it outputs the indices `s` and `e+1` where `e` is the end of the segment.
     - If the segment ends at or after `r`, it outputs `-1 -1`.

### Issues and Correctness
1. **Segment Grouping:**
   - The program correctly groups consecutive elements into segments.
   - However, the sentinel value `-1` is appended to `nums`, which might cause issues if `-1` is a valid element in the array (though the problem constraints do not allow this).

2. **Query Processing:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the segment is a good approach.
   - The logic to determine the indices `i` and `j` is flawed:
     - The condition `if s > l` is not sufficient to determine if no valid pair exists. It should check if the segment starting at `s` is entirely within the query range and if it contains only one unique value.
     - The condition `elif e >= r` is incorrect. It should check if the segment ends before `r` and if it contains only one unique value.
     - The condition `elif e < N` is also incorrect. It should check if the segment ends within the query range and if it contains only one unique value.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the entire query range contains only one unique value.
   - The sentinel value `-1` might cause issues if the array is empty or if the query range is at the end of the array.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified in the query processing logic and edge case handling, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
