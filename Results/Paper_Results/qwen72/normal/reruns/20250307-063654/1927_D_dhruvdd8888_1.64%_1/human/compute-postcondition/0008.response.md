The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N + 1` is greater than 0. This means `N` must be at least 0 for the loop to run at least once. The variable `i` starts at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function in Python.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `N` is at least 0. The other variables (`s`, `e`, `num`, and `arr`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the first element of `nums`, `arr` is an empty list**
