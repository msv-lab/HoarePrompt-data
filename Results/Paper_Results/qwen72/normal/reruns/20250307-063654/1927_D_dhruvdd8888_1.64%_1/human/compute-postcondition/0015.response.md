Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the first element of `nums`, and `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1, num)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` appends a new tuple to the list `arr`.
- The tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` is calculated as `(1 + 0, 1, num)`, which simplifies to `(1, 1, num)`.
- Since `arr` was initially empty if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`, or contained the tuple `(1, 0, num)` otherwise, after appending the new tuple, `arr` now contains the tuple `(1, 1, num)`.
- All other variables (`N`, `i`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, and `num`) remain unchanged.
