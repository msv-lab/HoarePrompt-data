Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
   - `eli` is the index returned by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `num` is `-1`.
   - `tc` and `ppp` remain unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement explicitly prints the values `-1` and `-1`.
   - The values of `s`, `e`, `num`, and other variables are not used in the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output `-1, -1` regardless of the values of the other variables and the initial state.

Output: **-1, -1**
