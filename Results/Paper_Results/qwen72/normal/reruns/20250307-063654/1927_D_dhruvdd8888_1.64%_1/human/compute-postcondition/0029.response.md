The loop head contains only the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it does not need to be adjusted as it is not used outside the loop head.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the result of `int(input())`.

State: **`N` is an integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. The result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**
