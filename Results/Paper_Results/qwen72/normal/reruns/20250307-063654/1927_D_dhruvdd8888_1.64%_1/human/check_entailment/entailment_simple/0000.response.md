### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself.
   - It initializes variables `s`, `e`, and `num` to 0, 0, and the first element of `nums`, respectively.
   - It appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases where the last segment is not processed.
   - It then iterates over the array to create segments where each segment contains the same value. These segments are stored in the list `arr` as tuples `(start_index + 1, end_index, value)`, where `start_index` is the index of the first occurrence of the value in the segment, and `end_index` is the index of the last occurrence of the value in the segment before a different value appears.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The function reads the number of queries `q` and then iterates over each query.
   - For each query, it reads the integers `l` and `r`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` of the first segment in `arr` that starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists:
     - If the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is 1. If so, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair). Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).
     - If the end of the segment `e` is less than `N`, it prints `(s, e + 1)`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair).

4. **Edge Cases and Conditions:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the last segment is not processed by appending `-1` to `nums`.
   - The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the segment that starts at or after `l`.
   - The conditions for determining the validity of the pair `(i, j)` are logically sound.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The condition `if tc > 5:` and `if ppp == 23:` are not necessary for the correctness of the program. They are used for debugging and should be removed in a final version.
   - The program does not handle the case where `l` and `r` are equal, which is not allowed according to the problem statement (`1 ≤ l < r ≤ n`).

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct, but it has a few unnecessary conditions and does not handle the case where `l` and `r` are equal (though this is not a valid input according to the problem statement). The core logic for finding the valid pairs is correct.

Correctness: **True**
