Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
- `s` is `N`.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is `-1`.
- `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
- `tc` is greater than 5.
- `ppp` is 23.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(l, r)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the values of `l` and `r`.
- According to the initial state, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe them as integers obtained from the input.

### Output:
Output: **l, r (where l and r are integers obtained from the input)**
