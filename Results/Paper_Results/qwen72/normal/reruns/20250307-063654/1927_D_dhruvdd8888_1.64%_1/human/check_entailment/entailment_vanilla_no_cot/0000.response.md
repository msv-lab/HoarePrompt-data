Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Function Call Before Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is executed.

2. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**:
   - The `bisect_left` function is used to find the leftmost index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` could be inserted to keep the array sorted. However, this is not the correct way to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the range `[l, r]`.
   - The `bisect_left` function is comparing tuples, but the comparison is not based on the actual values of the elements in the array, which is necessary to find distinct elements.

3. **Handling of Queries**:
   - The logic for handling the queries is flawed. The program attempts to use the `arr` list to find the indices, but the way it constructs `arr` and uses `bisect_left` does not correctly identify the required indices.
   - The program also has a conditional check `if tc > 5:` and `if ppp == 23:` which are not necessary and do not contribute to solving the problem.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the array has all the same elements or when the query range is very small.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
- For each query, check if there are any two distinct elements within the range `[l, r]`.
- If such a pair exists, output the indices of the pair.
- If no such pair exists, output `-1 -1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    q = int(input())
    
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        found = False
        for i in range(l-1, r):
            for j in range(i+1, r):
                if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                    print(i+1, j+1)
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            print(-1, -1)
```

This version correctly processes each query by checking all pairs within the range `[l, r]` to find a pair of distinct elements. If such a pair is found, it prints the indices; otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.
