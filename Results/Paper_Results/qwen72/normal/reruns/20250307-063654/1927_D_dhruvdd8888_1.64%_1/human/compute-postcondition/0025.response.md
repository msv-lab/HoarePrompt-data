Output State: **`N` is an integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `LA = len(arr) - 1` calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, assigning the result to `LA`.
- The length of `arr` is the number of tuples in the list, so `LA` is one less than this number.
- The values of `N`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, and `num` remain unchanged.
- The description of `arr` remains the same, but now we have an additional variable `LA` that holds the value `len(arr) - 1`.
