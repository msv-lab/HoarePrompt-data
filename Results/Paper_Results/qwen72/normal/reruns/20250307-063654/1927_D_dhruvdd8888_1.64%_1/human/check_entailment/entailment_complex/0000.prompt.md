Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Each tuple is in the form `(start_index + 1, end_index, value)` where `start_index` is the index of the first occurrence of the value in the segment, and `end_index` is the index of the last occurrence of the value in the segment before a different value appears.

    #State: The values of `N`, `nums`, `num`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, respectively, for the last iteration. `LA` remains `len(arr) - 1`. `l` and `r` are the last integers obtained from the input. If `tc` > 5, the loop may have skipped some iterations due to the `continue` statement. If `ppp` is 23, it remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `nums` from the standard input. It then processes a series of queries, each consisting of two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, the function determines the segment of `nums` that contains the same value and intersects with the range `[l, r]`. If such a segment exists, it returns the start and end indices of the segment. If no such segment exists, it returns `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return a list of results; instead, it prints the results directly to the standard output for each query. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged values of `N`, `nums`, and `arr`, and the last processed values of `l` and `r`.
