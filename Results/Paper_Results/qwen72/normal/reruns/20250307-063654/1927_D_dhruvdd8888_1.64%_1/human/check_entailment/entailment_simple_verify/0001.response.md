Reasoning:

1. **Segment Grouping:**
   - The program correctly groups consecutive elements into segments and stores them in `arr` as tuples `(start, end, value)`.
   - The sentinel value `-1` is appended to `nums` to ensure the last segment is processed, which is a valid approach given the constraints that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6`.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or after `l` is a good approach.
   - However, the logic to determine the indices `i` and `j` is flawed:
     - **Condition `if s > l`:** This condition is intended to check if the segment starts after `l`. However, it should also check if the segment starts at the beginning of the array and if it contains only one unique value. The current implementation incorrectly outputs `-1 -1` if `s == 1`, which is not always correct.
     - **Condition `elif e >= r`:** This condition is intended to check if the segment ends at or after `r`. However, it should check if the segment ends before `r` and if it contains only one unique value. The current implementation incorrectly outputs `-1 -1` if `e >= r`, which is not always correct.
     - **Condition `elif e < N`:** This condition is intended to check if the segment ends within the query range. However, it should check if the segment ends within the query range and if it contains only one unique value. The current implementation incorrectly outputs `s, e + 1` if `e < N`, which is not always correct.
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the entire query range contains only one unique value.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the query range `(l, r)` is entirely within a segment that contains only one unique value.
   - The sentinel value `-1` is not a problem because it is outside the valid range of `a_i`.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified in the query processing logic and edge case handling, the program is not correct. The original assessment accurately points out the flaws in the logic and edge case handling.

Final: **False**
