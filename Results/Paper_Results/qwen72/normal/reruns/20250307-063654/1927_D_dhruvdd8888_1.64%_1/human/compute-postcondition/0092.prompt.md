You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, a is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, and each query (l, r) is a pair of integers where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: `N` is an integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, and `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value. Each tuple is in the form `(start_index + 1, end_index, value)` where `start_index` is the index of the first occurrence of the value in the segment, and `end_index` is the index of the last occurrence of the value in the segment before a different value appears.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: [input integers, -1] (where the input integers are the integers provided in the input list, and -1 is appended to the end of the list)
    #State: *`N` is an integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is 23, the postcondition remains unchanged.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The values of `N`, `nums`, `num`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, respectively, for the last iteration. `LA` remains `len(arr) - 1`. `l` and `r` are the last integers obtained from the input. If `tc` > 5, the loop may have skipped some iterations due to the `continue` statement. If `ppp` is 23, it remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, and `queries`. It processes `q` queries on the list `a` and returns a list of results for each query.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
