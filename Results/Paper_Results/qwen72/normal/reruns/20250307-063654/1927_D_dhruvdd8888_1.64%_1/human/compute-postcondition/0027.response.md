Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
2. `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
3. `s` is `N`.
4. `e` is 0.
5. `num` is `-1`.
6. `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
7. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
8. `ppp` is 23.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nums)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`N`**: This is an integer value obtained from the input. We don't know the exact value of `N` without the input, but it is an integer.
2. **`nums`**: This is a list of integers obtained from the input, with `-1` appended to the end. For example, if the input list of integers is `[1, 2, 3]`, then `nums` will be `[1, 2, 3, -1]`.
3. **`s`**: This is equal to `N`.
4. **`e`**: This is 0.
5. **`num`**: This is `-1`.
6. **`arr`**: This is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value. For example, if `nums` is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, -1]`, then `arr` might be `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (-1, 1)]`, where each tuple `(value, count)` represents a segment of the list with the same value and its count.
7. **`LA`**: This is `len(arr) - 1`. For example, if `arr` is `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (-1, 1)]`, then `len(arr)` is 3, and `LA` is 2.
8. **`ppp`**: This is 23.

### What Will Be Printed:
The `print(nums)` statement will print the list `nums`, which is the list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.

Since the exact input is not provided, we can't determine the specific values in `nums`, but we know the structure of `nums` based on the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **[input integers, -1] (where the input integers are the integers provided in the input list, and -1 is appended to the end of the list)**
