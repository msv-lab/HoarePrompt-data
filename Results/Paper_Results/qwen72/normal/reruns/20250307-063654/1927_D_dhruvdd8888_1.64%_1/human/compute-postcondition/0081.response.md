Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
2. `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
3. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
4. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
5. `num` is `-1`.
6. `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
7. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
8. `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
9. `eli` is the index returned by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
10. `tc` and `ppp` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement explicitly prints the values `-1` and `-1`.
- The values `-1` and `-1` are constants and do not depend on any variables or objects from the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
