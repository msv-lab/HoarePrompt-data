Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`N`**: An integer value obtained from the input.
2. **`nums`**: A list of integers obtained from the input, with `-1` appended to the end.
3. **`s`**: The first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
4. **`e`**: The second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
5. **`num`**: Set to `-1`.
6. **`arr`**: A list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
7. **`LA`**: Set to `len(arr) - 1`.
8. **`l` and `r`**: Integers obtained from the input.
9. **`eli`**: The index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
10. **`tc`**: An integer value that influences the loop behavior. If `tc` > 5, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
11. **`ppp`**: Set to 23 if `tc` > 5. If `ppp` is 23, then:
    - If `s` > `l`, `s` is greater than `l`.
    - If `s` is 1, it is greater than `l`.
    - If `s` <= `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
    - If `e` >= `r`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.
    - If `e` < `r` and `e` < `N`, then `e` is less than `r` and `N`.
    - If `e` >= `N`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.
12. **If `tc` <= 5, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.
- These values are constants and do not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
