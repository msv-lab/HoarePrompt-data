Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `N` is an integer value obtained from the input.
2. `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
3. `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
4. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
5. `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
6. `eli` is the index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
7. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
8. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
9. `num` is `-1`.
10. If `tc` > 5, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop, and `ppp` is set to 23.
11. If `ppp` is 23, then:
    - If `s` > `l`, `s` is greater than `l`.
    - If `s` is 1, it is greater than `l`.
    - If `s` <= `l`, then `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
12. Additionally, if `e` >= `r`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.
13. Otherwise, if `e` < `r` and `e` < `N`, then `e` is less than `r` and `N`.
14. If `e` >= `N`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.
15. If `tc` <= 5, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s - 1, s)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `s` and `e`:**
   - `s` and `e` are elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, so `min(eli, LA)` ensures that the index is within the bounds of `arr`.

2. **Conditions and Variables:**
   - The conditions involving `tc` and `ppp` do not directly affect the values of `s` and `e` in the `print` statement.
   - The conditions involving `s` and `e` are used to describe their relationships with `l` and `r`, but they do not change the values of `s` and `e`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will output `s - 1` and `s`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s - 1` is simply `s` minus 1.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `s - 1` followed by the value of `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
