Reasoning:  
The program's logic is flawed in several aspects, which can lead to incorrect results for the given problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**: The `bisect_left` function is used to find the first position in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`. However, the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` used for comparison is not appropriate. The correct approach would be to use a tuple that matches the structure of the elements in `arr` for a more accurate comparison.

2. **Handling of Queries**: The logic for handling queries is not robust. The program checks if the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l` and if the end of the segment `e` is less than `r`. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the segment might be entirely within the query range or where the segment might start at `l` but end before `r`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the array `nums` consists of all the same elements, the program might incorrectly report a pair of indices where the elements are different.

4. **Global Variables and Function Calls**: The function `func_1` is called within a loop that iterates `tc` times, but the function itself reads input and processes the array, which means it will read input multiple times. This is not a standard practice and can lead to confusion and potential errors.

5. **Debugging Statements**: The program includes debugging statements that are not necessary for the final solution and can affect the output if `ppp` is 23.

Given these issues, the program is not likely to produce the correct output for all test cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
