Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 2, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the third element of `nums`. If the second element of `nums` is not equal to the first element of `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 1, first element of nums)` and `(2, 2, second element of nums)`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(2, 2, second element of `nums`)` if the first element of `nums` is equal to the second element of `nums`.**
