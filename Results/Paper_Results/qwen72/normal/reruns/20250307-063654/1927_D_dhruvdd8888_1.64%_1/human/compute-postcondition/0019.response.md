The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `N + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `N` must still be at least 0, ensuring that `N + 1` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is 1, `e` is 0, `num` is equal to the second element of `nums`. If the second element of `nums` is not equal to the first element of `nums`, `arr` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1, first element of nums)`. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list if the first element of `nums` is equal to the second element of `nums`.**
