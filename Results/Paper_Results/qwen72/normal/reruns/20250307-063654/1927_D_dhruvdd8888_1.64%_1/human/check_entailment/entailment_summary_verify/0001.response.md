### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided function summary and the original assessment.

#### Input Handling
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

#### Function `func_1()`
- **Segment Grouping:**
  - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
  - It initializes `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
  - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
  - It iterates over the array to group consecutive elements that are the same into segments and stores these segments in `arr` as tuples `(start, end, value)`.

  This part of the function is correct. The sentinel value `-1` is used to ensure that the last segment is processed, and it does not interfere with the logic since `-1` is not a valid element in the array according to the problem constraints.

- **Query Processing:**
  - For each query `(l, r)`, it uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` of the segment that starts at or after `l`.
  - It then checks the segment boundaries:
    - **Condition `if s > l`:**
      - This condition checks if the segment starts after `l`. If so, it checks if the segment starts at the beginning of the array. If the segment starts at the beginning, it outputs `-1 -1`. Otherwise, it outputs the indices `s-1` and `s`.
      - This logic is flawed. If `s > l`, it does not necessarily mean that the segment starting at `s` is the only segment in the range `[l, r]`. It should check if the segment starting at `s` is entirely within the query range and if it contains only one unique value.
    - **Condition `elif e >= r`:**
      - This condition checks if the segment ends at or after `r`. If so, it outputs `-1 -1`.
      - This logic is incorrect. It should check if the segment ends before `r` and if it contains only one unique value.
    - **Condition `elif e < N`:**
      - This condition checks if the segment ends before the end of the array. If so, it outputs the indices `s` and `e+1`.
      - This logic is also incorrect. It should check if the segment ends within the query range and if it contains only one unique value.
    - **Condition `else`:**
      - This condition outputs `-1 -1` if none of the above conditions are met.
      - This logic is not sufficient to handle all cases correctly.

#### Edge Cases
- The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the entire query range contains only one unique value.
- The sentinel value `-1` might cause issues if the array is empty or if the query range is at the end of the array, but this is not a concern given the problem constraints.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified in the query processing logic and edge case handling, the program is not correct. The original assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the logic and the incorrect handling of edge cases.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program's logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` is flawed, and it does not correctly handle all possible query ranges and edge cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
