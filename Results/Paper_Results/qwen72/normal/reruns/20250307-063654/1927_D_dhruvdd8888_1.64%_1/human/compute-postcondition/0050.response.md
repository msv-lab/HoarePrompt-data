Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. **`N`**: An integer value obtained from the input.
2. **`nums`**: A list of integers obtained from the input with `-1` appended to the end.
3. **`arr`**: A list of tuples where each tuple represents a segment of the `nums` list that contains the same value.
4. **`LA`**: `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last index of the `arr` list.
5. **`l` and `r`**: Integers obtained from the input.
6. **`eli`**: The index in `arr` where the first tuple with a value greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
7. **`s`**: The first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
8. **`e`**: The second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
9. **`num`**: `-1`.
10. **`s` is less than or equal to `l`**.
11. **`e` is less than `r`**.
12. **The current value of `e` is less than `N`**.
13. **`tc`**: If `tc` > 5, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
14. **`ppp`**: Set to 23, but not used in the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s, e + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`min(eli, LA)`**: This expression will evaluate to the minimum of `eli` and `LA`. Since `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, it represents the last valid index in the `arr` list.
2. **`s` and `e`**: These are the first and second elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. According to the initial state:
   - `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is less than `r`.
   - `e` is also less than `N`.

3. **`print(s, e + 1)`**: This statement will print the value of `s` and the value of `e + 1`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `s` and the value of `e + 1`. Given the initial state:
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and it is less than or equal to `l`.
- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and it is less than `r` and `N`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr and s <= l, and e + 1 is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr plus 1, and e < r and e < N)**
