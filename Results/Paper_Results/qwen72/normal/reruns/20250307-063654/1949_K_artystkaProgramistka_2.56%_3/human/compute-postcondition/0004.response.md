The function `distribute_number(num)` is called, which implies that some logic is applied to distribute the number `num` into one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`). However, the specific logic of the function is not provided, so we can only infer the changes based on the function's name and the context.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order.
- `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.
- `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are all 0.
- `num` is the first element in `numbers`.

The function `distribute_number(num)` is called, which will likely add `num` to one of the groups and update the corresponding sum. However, without the specific implementation, we can only assume that `num` is added to one of the groups and the corresponding sum is updated.

Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c` contains the first element of `numbers` (which is `num`), `sum_a`, `sum_b`, or `sum_c` is updated to `num`, the other groups and sums remain unchanged.**
