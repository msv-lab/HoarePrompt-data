Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and then distributes the elements of `numbers` into three groups, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, such that the sizes of these groups are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively. The function returns 'YES' and the three groups if the distribution is valid according to an external function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)`, where `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. If the distribution is not valid, the function returns 'NO'. **
