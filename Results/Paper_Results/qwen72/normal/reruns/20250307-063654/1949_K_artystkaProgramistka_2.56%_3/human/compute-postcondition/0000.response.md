The list `numbers` is sorted in descending order. The values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged, and the condition `na + nb + nc = n` still holds. The list `numbers` now contains the same elements as before, but they are ordered from the largest to the smallest.

Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order.**
