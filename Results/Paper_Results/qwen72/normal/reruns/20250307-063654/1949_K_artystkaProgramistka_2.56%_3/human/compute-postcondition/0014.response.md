The function `func_2` accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of elements in the list `numbers`.
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, representing the sizes of three groups.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.

The function returns one of the following:

- **Case 1**: If the elements in `numbers` can be successfully distributed into three groups `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` such that:
  - Each group contains `na`, `nb`, and `nc` elements, respectively.
  - The elements in each group are sorted in descending order.
  - The sum of the elements in `group_a` is `sum_a`, the sum of the elements in `group_b` is `sum_b`, and the sum of the elements in `group_c` is `sum_c`.
  - The function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns `True`, indicating that the distribution is valid.
  - The function returns 'YES' along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`.

- **Case 2**: If the elements in `numbers` cannot be distributed as described above, the function returns 'NO'.

Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`. It returns 'YES' and the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if the elements can be distributed into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` with each group's elements sorted in descending order and the distribution is valid according to `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)`. If the distribution is not possible, it returns 'NO'.**
