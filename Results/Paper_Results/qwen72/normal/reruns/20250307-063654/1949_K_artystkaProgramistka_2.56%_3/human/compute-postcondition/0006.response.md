Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c` contains the first two elements of `numbers`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, or `sum_c` is updated to the sum of the first two elements of `numbers`, the other groups and sums remain unchanged, `num` is the third element in `numbers`.**
