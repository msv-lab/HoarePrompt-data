Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists. `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are all 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers:
    distribute_number(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c` contains the first element of `numbers` (which is `num`), `sum_a`, `sum_b`, or `sum_c` is updated to `num`, the other groups and sums remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c` contains the first two elements of `numbers`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, or `sum_c` is updated to the sum of the first two elements of `numbers`, the other groups and sums remain unchanged, `num` is the third element in `numbers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c` contains the first two elements of `numbers`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, or `sum_c` is updated to the sum of the first two elements of `numbers`, the other groups and sums remain unchanged, `num` is the fourth element in `numbers`, and `num` has been distributed to one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`) and the corresponding sum (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, or `sum_c`) has been updated to include `num`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
