Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing the elements of `numbers` distributed among them, and `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The initial conditions for `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain true, meaning they are positive integers and their sum equals `n`.
- The `numbers` list remains a list of `n` positive integers, sorted in descending order.
- The elements of `numbers` have been distributed among `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` such that each group contains some of the elements from `numbers`.
- The sums `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` have been updated to reflect the total sum of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively.
