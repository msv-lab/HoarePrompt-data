Output State: **The program returns 'YES' along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. Each of these lists contains a portion of the elements from the list `numbers`, which is sorted in descending order. The elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are distributed such that the sum of the elements in `group_a` is `sum_a`, the sum of the elements in `group_b` is `sum_b`, and the sum of the elements in `group_c` is `sum_c`. The function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` has returned `True`, indicating that the distribution of elements among the groups is valid.**
