Postcondition: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing the elements of `numbers` distributed among them, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively, and the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns `True`.**
