Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 <= `numbers[i]` <= 10^9, sorted in descending order. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**

The initial state variables `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged, and the list `numbers` also remains unchanged. The new variables `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are initialized as empty lists.
