### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - `func_15()` reads the values of `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`, which reads two integers from the standard input.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The function `func_15()` is designed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)
   - The loop in `func_15()` iterates over `i` from 1 to the smallest integer greater than `m` or such that \(i^2 > n + i\).
   - For each `i`, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
   - The function then returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Output:**
   - `func_16()` iterates over the range of test cases and prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case.

4. **Validation of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_15()` is based on the observation that for a pair \((a, b)\) to satisfy \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), \(a\) must be of the form \(k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\) for some integer \(k\).
   - The loop in `func_15()` is designed to count such pairs by iterating over possible values of `i` (which represents `b` in this context) and calculating the number of valid `a` values for each `i`.
   - The condition \(i * i <= n + i\) ensures that the loop does not run unnecessarily for large values of `i`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\)) correctly.
   - The function also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) as specified in the problem constraints.

6. **Overall Program Flow:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `m` and printing the result of `func_15()`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\) as described in the problem. The functions are well-defined and the overall flow of the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
