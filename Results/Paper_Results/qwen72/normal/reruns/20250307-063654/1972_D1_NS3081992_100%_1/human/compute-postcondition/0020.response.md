Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `d[da]` has a length greater than 1, `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all integers `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- The dictionary `d` remains unchanged.
- The list `processing` remains unchanged.
- The list `rank` remains unchanged.
- The integer key `da` remains unchanged.
- The list `d[da]` has a length greater than 1.
- The variable `tmp` will hold the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all integers `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was 0 during the loop's execution. If none of the `di` values in `d[da]` had `processing[di - 1]` equal to 0, `tmp` will remain 1000000000.
