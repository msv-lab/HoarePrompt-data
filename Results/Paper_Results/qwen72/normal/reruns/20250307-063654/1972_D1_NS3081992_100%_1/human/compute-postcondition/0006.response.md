Output State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a placeholder and not used in the loop head, the value of `func_15()` is printed to the console for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the function `func_10()` must have returned a value that is at least as large as the number of iterations that were performed. For each iteration, the value returned by `func_15()` was printed to the console. The placeholder `_` was used in the loop but did not affect the loop's behavior.
