To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition step by step:

The loop condition is:
```
while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `i`
- `m`
- `n`

### Current State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\)
- `i` is 3
- `ans` is \((n + 1) // 1 + (n + 2) // 4\)

### Loop Condition Analysis:
1. **First Condition: `i <= m`**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - Therefore, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

2. **Second Condition: `i * i <= n + i`**
   - For the loop to execute again, \(i^2\) must be less than or equal to \(n + i\).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - Therefore, \(3^2 \leq n + 3\), which simplifies to \(9 \leq n + 3\).
   - This further simplifies to \(6 \leq n\).

### Conclusion:
- `i` is 3, which is already less than or equal to `m` (assuming `m` is at least 3).
- `n` must be at least 6 for the second condition to hold true.

Since `i` is already 3 and `m` must be at least 3, and `n` must be at least 6, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is at least 6.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `i` is 3, `ans` is \((n + 1) // 1 + (n + 2) // 4\), and `n` must be at least 6**
