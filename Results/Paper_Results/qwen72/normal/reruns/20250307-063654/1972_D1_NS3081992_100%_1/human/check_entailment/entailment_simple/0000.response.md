### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - `func_16()` iterates `t` times, reading `n` and `m` for each test case using `func_7()`, and then calls `func_15()` to compute the result for each test case.

2. **Function `func_15`:**
   - This function is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It then enters a loop that continues as long as `i <= m` and `i * i <= n + i`.
   - Inside the loop, it updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - After the loop, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop condition `i <= m and i * i <= n + i` is intended to ensure that `i` does not exceed `m` and that the value of `i * i` does not exceed `n + i`.
   - The loop updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\), which is the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for the current `i`.

4. **Correctness of the Loop:**
   - The loop correctly counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each `i` from 1 to the smallest integer greater than `m` or such that \(i^2 > n + i\).
   - However, the loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not the correct condition to ensure that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The correct condition should be based on the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the relationship between `a` and `b`.

5. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \quad \text{for some integer } k
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1) \cdot b
     \]
   - For each `b`, we need to count the number of valid `a` values that satisfy this condition. The current loop does not correctly implement this logic.

6. **Output Handling:**
   - `func_16()` correctly prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The loop condition in `func_15()` is incorrect and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
