Postcondition: ***`d` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `d[da]` has a length greater than 2, `di` is the third integer in `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 1000000000.***
