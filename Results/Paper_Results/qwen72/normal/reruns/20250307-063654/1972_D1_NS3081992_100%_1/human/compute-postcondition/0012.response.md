Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is the smallest integer greater than `m` or such that \(i^2 > n + i\), and `ans` is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all `i` from 1 to the value of `i` just before it exits the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain within the initial bounds of 1 to 2 * 10^6, as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be the smallest integer that either exceeds `m` or for which \(i^2 > n + i\). This means the loop stops when `i` is no longer less than or equal to `m` and the square of `i` is greater than `n + i`.
- **`ans`**: This variable accumulates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each iteration of the loop, where `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until the loop condition is no longer satisfied. The final value of `ans` is the sum of these integer divisions for all valid `i` values.
