Functionality: ** The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It iterates a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`, and for each iteration, it prints the result of `func_15()` to the console, followed by a newline. After the function concludes, the console will contain the output of `func_15()` for each test case, and the function will have no further effect on the program's state. **
