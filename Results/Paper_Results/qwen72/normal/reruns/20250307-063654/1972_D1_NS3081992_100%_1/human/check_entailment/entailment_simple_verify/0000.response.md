### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_15` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_15` is designed to solve the problem for a single test case.
   - It reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop where `i` is incremented until \(i > m\) or \(i^2 > n + i\).
   - Inside the loop, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Annotations and State Analysis**:
   - The state before the loop in `func_15` is that `n` and `m` are positive integers, `i` is 1, and `ans` is 0.
   - The loop condition `i <= m and i * i <= n + i` is not directly related to the problem's requirements.
   - The calculation \((n + i) // (i * i)\) inside the loop does not seem to be related to the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - The current implementation of `func_15` does not correctly count these pairs. It uses a loop that increments `i` and performs a calculation that is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The current implementation does not do this and instead uses a different logic that does not solve the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The function `func_15` does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. The loop and the calculation inside the loop are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
