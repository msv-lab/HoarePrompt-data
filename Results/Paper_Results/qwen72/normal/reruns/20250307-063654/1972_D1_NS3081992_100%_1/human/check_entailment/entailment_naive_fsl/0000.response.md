Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_15()` is intended to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the logic in `func_15()` does not correctly implement the required condition. Specifically, the condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not seem to be related to the problem's requirements. 

To illustrate, consider the test case (n=2, m=3). According to the problem description, the valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2). However, the current implementation of `func_15()` does not correctly count these pairs. The function should iterate over all possible values of a and b and check the condition `a + b % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0` to count the valid pairs. The current implementation fails to do this and hence is incorrect.
