The function `func_2` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line by spaces, converts each resulting string element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not modify any external variables and does not have any side effects. After the function concludes, the caller will receive a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
