The loop head contains the placeholder `_` and the function call `func_10()`. The placeholder `_` is not used and does not need to be adjusted. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `func_10()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a value greater than 0.

Since the loop head does not modify any variables or states, and the placeholder `_` is not used, the only state that can affect the loop's continuation is the return value of `func_10()`.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not used in the loop head, the value of `func_15()` is printed to the console.**
