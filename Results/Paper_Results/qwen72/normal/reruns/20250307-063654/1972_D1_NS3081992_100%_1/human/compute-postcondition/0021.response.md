Output State: **`d` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers, `processing` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `rank` is a list of integers of length at least max(d.keys()), `da` is an integer key present in `d`, `d[da]` has a length greater than 1, `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all integers `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `rank[da - 1]` is `tmp + 1`.** 

The value of `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all integers `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
