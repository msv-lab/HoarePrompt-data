Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `i` is 3, `ans` is \((n + 1) // 1 + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9\), and `n` must be at least 6.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to its current value.
- `i` is 3, so \((i * i)\) is 9.
- The expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) simplifies to \((n + 3) // 9\).
- The initial value of `ans` is \((n + 1) // 1 + (n + 2) // 4\).
- After the code execution, `ans` becomes \((n + 1) // 1 + (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9\).
- The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` must be at least 6 is still valid.
