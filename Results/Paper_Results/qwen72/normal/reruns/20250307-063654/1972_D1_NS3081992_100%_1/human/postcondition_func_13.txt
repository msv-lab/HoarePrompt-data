The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`. For each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a` or the integers `n` and `m`. The final state of `k` depends on the values of the elements in `a` and the initial value of `k`.
