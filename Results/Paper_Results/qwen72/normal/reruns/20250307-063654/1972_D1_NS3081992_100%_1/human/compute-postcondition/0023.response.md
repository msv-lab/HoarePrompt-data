The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d`, `processing`, `da`, and `rank`. 

- `d` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list of integers.
- `processing` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`.
- `da` is an integer key present in `d`.
- `rank` is a list of integers of length at least the maximum key in `d`.

The function returns:
- Case_1: The integer 1.
- Case_2: The value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all integers `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da` (a key in `d`), and a list `rank`. It returns 1 in the first case. In the second case, it returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of recursive calls to `func_12` for each integer `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and updates `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1`.**
