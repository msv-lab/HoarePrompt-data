### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_15` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_15` is designed to solve the problem by iterating over possible values of \(i\) and summing up \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to the smallest integer greater than \(m\) or such that \(i^2 > n + i\).
   - The condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not directly correspond to the problem's requirements. Specifically, the problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the function is performing a different calculation.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - For the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), and \((2,2)\).
   - The current implementation of `func_15` does not correctly count these pairs. It iterates over \(i\) and sums up \((n + i) // (i * i)\), which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is correct. The function `func_15` does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.
   - The function `func_15` is incorrect because it uses a different and unrelated logic to calculate the number of valid pairs.
