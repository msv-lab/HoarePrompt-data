You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can rewrite the condition as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot d \quad \text{where} \quad d = \gcd(a, b)
     \]
   - Dividing both sides by \(d\):
     \[
     \frac{a}{d} + \frac{b}{d} = k \cdot b
     \]
   - Let \(a' = \frac{a}{d}\) and \(b' = \frac{b}{d}\). Then:
     \[
     a' + b' = k \cdot b'
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     a' = (k - 1) \cdot b'
     \]
   - Since \(a'\) and \(b'\) are coprime (i.e., \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\)), \(a'\) must be a multiple of \(b'\) with a coprime factor.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided function `func_15` attempts to solve the problem by iterating over possible values of \(i\) (which represents \(b\)) and calculating the number of valid pairs.
   - The loop condition `while i <= m and i * i <= n + i` ensures that \(i\) is within the bounds and the calculation is efficient.
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\). This is based on the observation that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(i\) and the range of \(a\) is constrained by \(n\).

4. **Function `func_15` Analysis:**
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
   - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

5. **Function `func_16` Analysis:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_10()`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` and writes the result to the standard output.

6. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The input is handled correctly by reading the number of test cases and the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.
   - The output is written correctly for each test case.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)) correctly.
   - The function also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) within the constraints.

8. **Efficiency:**
   - The loop in `func_15` runs in \(O(\sqrt{n + m})\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It efficiently counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) and handles the input and output as required.
