The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a placeholder, and the function call `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, the function `func_10()` must return a positive integer (greater than 0), because the `range()` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `func_10() - 1`, and if `func_10()` returns 0 or a negative number, the loop will not execute.

Since none of the variables in the function signature are used, and the loop's execution depends solely on the return value of `func_10()`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not used in the loop head**
