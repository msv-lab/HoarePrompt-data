### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be simplified to \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot d\) where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Dividing both sides by \(d\), we get \(\frac{a}{d} + \frac{b}{d} = k \cdot b\).
   - Let \(a' = \frac{a}{d}\) and \(b' = \frac{b}{d}\). Then \(a' + b' = k \cdot b'\).
   - This implies \(a' = (k - 1) \cdot b'\).
   - Since \(a'\) and \(b'\) are coprime, \(a'\) must be a multiple of \(b'\) with a coprime factor.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided function `func_15` attempts to solve the problem by iterating over possible values of \(i\) (which represents \(b\)) and calculating the number of valid pairs.
   - The loop condition `while i <= m and i * i <= n + i` ensures that \(i\) is within the bounds and the calculation is efficient.
   - The expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\). This is based on the observation that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(i\) and the range of \(a\) is constrained by \(n\).

4. **Function `func_15` Analysis:**
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and \(i \cdot i \le n + i\).
   - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

5. **Function `func_16` Analysis:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_10()`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` and writes the result to the standard output.

6. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The input is handled correctly by reading the number of test cases and the values of \(n\) and \(m\) for each test case.
   - The output is written correctly for each test case.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \(n\) and \(m\) are small (e.g., \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)) correctly.
   - The function also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) within the constraints.

8. **Efficiency:**
   - The loop in `func_15` runs in \(O(\sqrt{n + m})\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Function `func_15`:**
  - The loop condition `while i <= m and i * i <= n + i` is correct for ensuring that \(i\) is within the bounds and the calculation is efficient.
  - The expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\). This is based on the observation that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(i\) and the range of \(a\) is constrained by \(n\).
  - However, the final return statement `return ans - 1` is incorrect. The subtraction of 1 is not justified by the problem statement or the mathematical insight. The correct return should be `return ans`.

- **Function `func_16`:**
  - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
  - It calls `func_15()` for each test case and writes the result to the standard output.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was mostly accurate in terms of the problem understanding, mathematical insight, and overall algorithm analysis. However, the final return statement in `func_15` is incorrect, which affects the correctness of the program.

Final: **False**
