Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from the standard input and returns this integer. The function does not modify any external state or variables. After the function concludes, the program has an integer value that was read from the standard input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line by spaces, converts each resulting string element to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not modify any external variables and does not have any side effects. After the function concludes, the caller will receive a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a line of integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing `rows_number` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_3()`. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns the next line of input from the standard input (stdin) as a byte string, with the trailing newline character removed.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line from standard input, decodes it from bytes to a string, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads two integers from the standard input, which are expected to be separated by a space, and returns a list containing these two integers. If the input does not conform to this format, the behavior is undefined.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `rows`, which is a non-negative integer, and returns a list of length `rows`, where each element is the result of calling `func_7()`. The function does not modify any external state or variables, and the final state of the program includes the returned list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns a value that is input by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned value that is the user's input.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned integer value, which is the user's input.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace. The state of the program after the function concludes is that a list of strings, derived from the user's input, is available for further use.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da` (a key in `d`), and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if the list `d[da]` contains exactly one element. Otherwise, it returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between 1000000000 and the results of recursive calls to `func_12` for each integer `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0. Additionally, it updates `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `a * x + b * y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` and returns a tuple based on the results of the recursive call.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`. For each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a` or the integers `n` and `m`. The final state of `k` depends on the values of the elements in `a` and the initial value of `k`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` takes no parameters and returns an integer. It calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` that is either greater than `m` or satisfies \(i^2 > n + i\), where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\). The function then returns this sum minus 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It iterates a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`, and for each iteration, it prints the result of `func_15()` to the console, followed by a newline. After the function concludes, the console will contain the output of `func_15()` for each test case, and the function will have no further effect on the program's state.
