You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `a * x + b * y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` and returns a tuple based on the results of the recursive call.

For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `a[i]` is less than `m`, `k` is decreased by `m - a[i]`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`. Additionally, `k` is less than 0.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`. For each element that is less than `m`, it decreases `k` by the difference between `m` and the element. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The function does not modify the list `a` or the integers `n` and `m`. The final state of `k` depends on the values of the elements in `a` and the initial value of `k`.

    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `i` is the smallest integer greater than `m` or such that \(i^2 > n + i\), and `ans` is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all `i` from 1 to the value of `i` just before it exits the loop.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all `i` from 1 to the value of `i` just before it exits the loop, and `i` is the smallest integer greater than `m` or such that \(i^2 > n + i\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` takes no parameters and returns an integer. It calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the smallest integer `i` that is either greater than `m` or satisfies \(i^2 > n + i\), where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\). The function then returns this sum minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used. The function `func_16` is designed to iterate over a range of test cases and output the result of another function `func_15` for each test case, where the number of test cases is determined by the function `func_10`.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: `func_10()` must return a value greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a placeholder and not used in the loop head, the value of `func_15()` is printed to the console for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` does not accept any parameters. It iterates a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`, and for each iteration, it prints the result of `func_15()` to the console, followed by a newline. After the function concludes, the console will contain the output of `func_15()` for each test case, and the function will have no further effect on the program's state.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_15()` is intended to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the logic in `func_15()` does not correctly implement the required condition. Specifically, the condition `i * i <= n + i` and the calculation `(n + i) // (i * i)` do not seem to be related to the problem's requirements. 

To illustrate, consider the test case (n=2, m=3). According to the problem description, the valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2). However, the current implementation of `func_15()` does not correctly count these pairs. The function should iterate over all possible values of a and b and check the condition `a + b % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0` to count the valid pairs. The current implementation fails to do this and hence is incorrect.
