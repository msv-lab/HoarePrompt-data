Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated during each iteration, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in `L`.**

### Natural Language Description:
- **`t`**: The variable `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- **`n`**: The variable `n` is 0, as `n` is decremented to 0 in each test case within the loop.
- **`k`**: The variable `k` remains an input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`L`**: The list `L` contains the sequence of values of `(n + 1) // 2` that were calculated during each iteration of the inner `while` loop for each test case. Each test case will have its own sequence of values in `L`.
- **`m`**: The variable `m` holds the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` that was calculated before `n` became 0 in the most recent test case.
- **`tot`**: The variable `tot` is the sum of all elements in the list `L` for the most recent test case.
- **`pow`**: The variable `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in the list `L` for the most recent test case.

This output state reflects the final conditions of the variables after all iterations of the loop have completed, with `t` being decremented to 0 and `n` being 0 for each test case. The list `L` and the variables `m`, `tot`, and `pow` are updated based on the calculations performed within the loop for each test case.
