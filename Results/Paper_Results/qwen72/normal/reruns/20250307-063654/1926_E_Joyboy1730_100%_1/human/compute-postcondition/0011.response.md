Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list containing two elements, the first element is `(n + 1) // 2` and the second element is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged and are integers provided by the input, with `n` being greater than 0.
- The list `L` initially contains one element, `(n + 1) // 2`. After the code execution, `L` now contains two elements, both of which are `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged and is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
