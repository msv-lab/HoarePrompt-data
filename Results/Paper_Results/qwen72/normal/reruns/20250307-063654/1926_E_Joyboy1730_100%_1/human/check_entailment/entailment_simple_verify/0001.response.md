### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and the values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list \( L \) to keep track of the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - The loop `while n:` correctly calculates the number of odd-numbered cards in the current range and appends this count to \( L \). It then subtracts this count from \( n \) to move to the next range of cards.
   - The loop continues until \( n \) becomes 0, ensuring all cards are accounted for.

3. **Determining the \( k \)-th Card:**
   - The program initializes \( tot \) and \( pow \) to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - It iterates over the list \( L \) to find the segment where \( k \) belongs.
   - The condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a:` correctly checks if \( k \) is within the current segment.
   - The formula `print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))` correctly calculates the \( k \)-th card in the current segment.
   - \( pow \) is doubled in each iteration to account for the next power of 2 (i.e., the next set of cards that are multiples of the current power of 2).

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Calculation of \( m \):**
   - \( m = (n + 1) // 2 \) correctly calculates the number of odd-numbered cards in the range from 1 to \( n \). This is because for any \( n \), the number of odd numbers is \( \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil \), which is equivalent to \( (n + 1) // 2 \).

2. **Appending to \( L \):**
   - The list \( L \) is used to keep track of the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - The loop continues until \( n \) becomes 0, ensuring all cards are accounted for.

3. **Finding the \( k \)-th Card:**
   - The program iterates over \( L \) to find the segment where \( k \) belongs.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly calculates the \( k \)-th card in the current segment. Here, \( pow \) represents the current power of 2, and \( 2 * (k - tot) - 1 \) correctly identifies the position of the card within the segment of cards that are multiples of the current power of 2.

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Card:**
  - For \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 1 \), the program correctly prints 1.
- **Large \( n \):**
  - The program handles large values of \( n \) efficiently by using integer division and list appending.
- **Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program processes multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases \( t \) and iterating over them.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the \( k \)-th card laid down by Vladislav. It handles the input and output as specified and correctly calculates the card number for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
