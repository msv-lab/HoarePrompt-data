The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is the last value computed by `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1**
