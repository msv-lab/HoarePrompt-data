Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
        L.append(m)
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
        tot += a
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list containing at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `m` is the last value computed by `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in `L`, and the condition `tot < k and k <= tot + a` is checked for each element `a` in `L`. If the condition is met for any element, the corresponding value `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values of `(n + 1) // 2` computed in each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` computed before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a` for any `a` in `L`, the condition is met and the corresponding value is printed. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated during each iteration, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in `L`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
