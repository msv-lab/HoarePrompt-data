Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1**

The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.
