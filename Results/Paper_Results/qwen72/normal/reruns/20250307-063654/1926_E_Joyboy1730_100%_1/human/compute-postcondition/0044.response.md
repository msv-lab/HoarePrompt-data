Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a non-zero integer and `n` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the value `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1**

The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the same as the value already stored in `L` and the value `n` was reduced to by the previous operation. The other variables remain unchanged.
