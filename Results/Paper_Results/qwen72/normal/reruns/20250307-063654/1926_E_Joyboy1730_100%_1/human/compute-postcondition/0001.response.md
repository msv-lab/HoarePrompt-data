The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the loop is controlled by `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times, which is determined by `t`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `_`, but `t` must be ensured to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
