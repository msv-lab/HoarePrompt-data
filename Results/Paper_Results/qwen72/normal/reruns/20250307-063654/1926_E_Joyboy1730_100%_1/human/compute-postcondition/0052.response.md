Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values of `(n + 1) // 2` computed in each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` computed before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in `L`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `tot = 0` sets the variable `tot` to 0.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `m`, and `pow` remain unchanged from their initial state.
