Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of 0**

The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
