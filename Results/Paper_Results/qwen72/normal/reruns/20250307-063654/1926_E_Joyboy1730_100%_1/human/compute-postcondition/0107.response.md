The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function likely accepts these parameters in a structured form, such as a list of tuples or a similar data structure. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints.

Given the constraints, the function is expected to process each test case and return a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. However, without more specific information about the output, we can only describe the input parameters and the general structure of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
