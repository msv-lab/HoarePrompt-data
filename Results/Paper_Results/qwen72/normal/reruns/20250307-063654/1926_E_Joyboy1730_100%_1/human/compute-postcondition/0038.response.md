Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is the last value computed by `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` (which is 0 since `L` is now empty), `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in `L` (which is 1 since `L` is now empty).**
