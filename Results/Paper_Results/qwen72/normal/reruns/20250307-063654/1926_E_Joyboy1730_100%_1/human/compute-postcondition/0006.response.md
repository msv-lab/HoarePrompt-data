Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` are still integers provided by the input, and `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `L` remains an empty list.
- `m` is still equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. This means `n` is reduced by half its value, rounded down, plus 0.5 if `n` is odd.
