Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - ((n + 1) // 2)` and `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing `[(n + 1) // 2]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of 0**

The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
