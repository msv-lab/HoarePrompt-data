Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is now equal to `-(n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the value `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to `n - m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, `n` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `-(n + 1) // 2`.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `L`, `m`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.
