Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing at least one element, `a` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` computed before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, and `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.**
