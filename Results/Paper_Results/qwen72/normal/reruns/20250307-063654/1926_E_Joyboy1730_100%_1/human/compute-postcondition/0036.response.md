The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and `n` is 0. The variable `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration but is not used in the loop head or body, so it does not need to be explicitly stated in the state. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 since the loop counter is implied by the range of `t`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list containing at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `m` is the last value computed by `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in `L`**
