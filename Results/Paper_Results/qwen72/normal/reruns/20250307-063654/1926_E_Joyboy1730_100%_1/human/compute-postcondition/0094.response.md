The code snippet `pow *= 2` modifies the value of the variable `pow` by multiplying it by 2. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `pow`, so we can only describe the change in terms of the previous value of `pow`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated during each iteration and must have at least 1 element, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated, `tot` is `a`, `a` is the first element in `L`, `pow` is doubled.**
