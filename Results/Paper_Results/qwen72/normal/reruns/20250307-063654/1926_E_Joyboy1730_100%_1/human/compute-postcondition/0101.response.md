Let's break down the initial state and the code to understand what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `L` is a list containing the sequence of values of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated during each iteration and must have at least 3 elements.
   - `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated.
   - `tot` is `a` + `a`, where `a` is the third element in `L`.
   - `pow` is doubled.
   - If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the conditions and variable values remain as described in the precondition.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `L` is a list with at least 3 elements. Let's denote the elements of `L` as `L[0]`, `L[1]`, `L[2]`, etc.
   - `a` is the third element in `L`, so `a = L[2]`.
   - `tot` is `a + a`, so `tot = 2 * L[2]`.
   - `pow` is doubled, so `pow = 2 * pow`.

3. **Conditions:**
   - `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` must be true.
   - Substituting `tot` and `a`, the conditions become:
     - `2 * L[2] < k`
     - `k <= 2 * L[2] + L[2]` which simplifies to `k <= 3 * L[2]`.

4. **Expression in the Print Statement:**
   - The expression to be printed is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Substituting `tot` with `2 * L[2]`, the expression becomes `pow * (2 * (k - 2 * L[2]) - 1)`.

5. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - `2 * (k - 2 * L[2]) - 1` simplifies to `2 * k - 4 * L[2] - 1`.
   - Therefore, the expression to be printed is `pow * (2 * k - 4 * L[2] - 1)`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - Given that `pow` is doubled, the final expression is `2 * pow * (2 * k - 4 * L[2] - 1)`.

Since the exact values of `k` and `L[2]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 * pow * (2 * k - 4 * L[2] - 1) (where `pow` is the doubled value of `pow`, `k` is the input integer, and `L[2]` is the third element in the list `L`)**
