Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing `[(n + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of 0.**

The value of `m` is appended to the list `L`, so `L` now contains two elements, both of which are equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.
