Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated during each iteration, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of 0.**

The code snippet `tot = 0` reassigns the value of `tot` to 0, but since `tot` was already 0 in the initial state, no change occurs. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
