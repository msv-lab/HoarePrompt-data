Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values computed by `(n + 1) // 2` during each iteration of the loop, `m` is the last value computed by `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**

The variable `pow` is assigned the value 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `L`, `m`, and `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
