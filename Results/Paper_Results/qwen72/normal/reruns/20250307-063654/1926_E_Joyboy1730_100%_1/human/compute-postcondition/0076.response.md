The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `n - ((n + 1) // 2)`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 2 raised to the power of 0.**
