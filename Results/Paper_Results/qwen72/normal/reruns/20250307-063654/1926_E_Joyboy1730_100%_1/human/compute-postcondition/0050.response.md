Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is now equal to `-(n + 1) // 2 - ((n + 1) // 2)`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values `(n + 1) // 2`, `(n + 1) // 2`, and `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**

The value of `m` is appended to the list `L`, which now contains three elements, all of which are equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
