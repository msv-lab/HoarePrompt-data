Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list containing one element, which is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` and appended to the list `L`.
- The list `L` now contains one element, which is the value of `m`.
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
