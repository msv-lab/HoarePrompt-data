Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is now equal to `-(n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values `(n + 1) // 2` and `m`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The list `L` initially contains the value `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The code `L.append(m)` adds the value of `m` to the list `L`.
- Therefore, `L` now contains two elements, both of which are `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.
