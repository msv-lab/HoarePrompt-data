Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now equal to `(n - 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `L` is a list containing three elements, the first element is `(n + 1) // 2`, the second element is `(n + 1) // 2`, and the third element is `((n - 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`, `m` is equal to `((n - 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` remains equal to `(n - 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0.
- `L` is updated to contain three elements. The first two elements are still `(n + 1) // 2`, and the third element is `((n - 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`.
- `m` is equal to `((n - 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`, which is the value appended to `L`.
