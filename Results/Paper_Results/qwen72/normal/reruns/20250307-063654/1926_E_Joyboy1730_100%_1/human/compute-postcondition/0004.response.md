The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., not 0), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, and `L` is an empty list. Since `n` is an integer provided by the input, it needs to be ensured that `n` is not 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `L` is an empty list**
