The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, but `t` is not affected by this code snippet. The values of `n` and `k` are determined by the input provided.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input.**
