Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list containing two elements, the first element is `(n + 1) // 2` and the second element is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2` and `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2` where `n` is the new value of `n` after the subtraction.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` remain integers provided by the input.
- The list `L` remains unchanged, with the first and second elements both being `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `m` was initially set to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it, so `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- After this subtraction, `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `m` is then updated to `(n + 1) // 2` using the new value of `n`.

Since `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it, and `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` will be:

\[ n = n - \left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ n = \frac{n - 1}{2} \]

Then, `m` is updated to:

\[ m = \left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right) \]

where `n` is the new value after the subtraction. 

So, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `n` is now equal to `(n - 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `L` is a list containing two elements, the first element is `(n + 1) // 2` and the second element is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is equal to `((n - 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`.**
