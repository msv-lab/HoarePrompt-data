Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated during each iteration and must have at least 2 elements, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated, `tot` is `a` + `a`, `a` is the second element in `L`, `pow` is doubled. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the conditions and variable values remain as described in the precondition.**
