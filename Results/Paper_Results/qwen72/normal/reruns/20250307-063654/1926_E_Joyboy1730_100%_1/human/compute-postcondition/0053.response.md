Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values of `(n + 1) // 2` computed in each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` computed before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**

The value of `pow` is updated to 1, and all other variables remain unchanged.
