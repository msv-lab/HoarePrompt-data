Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n` is 0.
3. `k` is an input integer.
4. `L` is a list containing the sequence of values of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated during each iteration and must have at least 2 elements.
5. `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated.
6. `tot` is `a`.
7. `a` is the second element in `L`.
8. `pow` is doubled.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `L`**:
   - `L` is a list containing the sequence of values of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated during each iteration.
   - Since `n` starts at 0 and `L` must have at least 2 elements, the first element of `L` is `(0 + 1) // 2 = 0 // 2 = 0`.
   - The second element of `L` is `(1 + 1) // 2 = 2 // 2 = 1`.
   - Therefore, `L` is at least `[0, 1]`.

2. **Variable `a`**:
   - `a` is the second element in `L`.
   - From the analysis of `L`, `a` is 1.

3. **Variable `tot`**:
   - `tot` is `a`.
   - Since `a` is 1, `tot` is also 1.

4. **Variable `pow`**:
   - `pow` is doubled.
   - Let's assume the initial value of `pow` is `p` (where `p` is some integer).
   - After doubling, `pow` becomes `2 * p`.

5. **Expression inside the `print` statement**:
   - The expression is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `pow` is `2 * p`.
     - `tot` is 1.
     - The expression becomes: `2 * p * (2 * (k - 1) - 1)`.

6. **Simplifying the expression**:
   - `2 * (k - 1) - 1` can be simplified to `2k - 2 - 1 = 2k - 3`.
   - Therefore, the expression inside the `print` statement is: `2 * p * (2k - 3)`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `2 * p * (2k - 3)`, where `p` is the initial value of `pow` and `k` is the input integer.

Output: **2 * p * (2k - 3) (where p is the initial value of pow and k is the input integer)**
