Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is now equal to `-(n + 1) // 2` and `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the values `(n + 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is assigned the value `(n + 1) // 2`.
- Since `m` was already equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, this assignment does not change the value of `m`.
- The list `L` contains the values `(n + 1) // 2` and `m`. Since `m` is now `(n + 1) // 2`, the list `L` contains two identical values, both equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.
