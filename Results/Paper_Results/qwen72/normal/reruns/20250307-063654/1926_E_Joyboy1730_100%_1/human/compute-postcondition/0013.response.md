Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list containing two elements, the first element is `(n + 1) // 2` and the second element is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now equal to `n - (n + 1) // 2` and `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2` where `n` is the new value of `n` after the subtraction.**

In natural language: The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is the new value of `n` after subtracting `(n + 1) // 2` from the original `n`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
