Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`**. 

This means that `m` is now an integer value that is the result of the expression `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
