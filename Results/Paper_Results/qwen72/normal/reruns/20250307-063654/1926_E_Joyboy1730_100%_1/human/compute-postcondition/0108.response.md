Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It then processes `n` to generate a sequence of values, and for each value in this sequence, it checks if the cumulative total `tot` plus the current value includes `k`. If so, it prints a calculated result based on the current power of 2 and the position of `k` within the current value. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the results for each test case. **
