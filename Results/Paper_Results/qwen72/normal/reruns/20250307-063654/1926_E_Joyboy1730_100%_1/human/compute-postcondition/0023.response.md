Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `L` is a list containing at least one element, `m` is the last value computed by `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` becomes 0, `tot` is `a`, `pow` is 1, `a` is the first element in `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.**
