Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing the sequence of values of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated during each iteration and must have at least 1 element, `m` is the last value of `(n + 1) // 2` calculated, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `a` is the first element in `L`. If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the current value of `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
