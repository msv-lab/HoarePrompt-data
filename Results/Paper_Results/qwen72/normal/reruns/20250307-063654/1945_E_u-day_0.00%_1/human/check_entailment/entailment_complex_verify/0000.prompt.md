You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Annotated Code:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed in the function signature. The function reads input from the standard input, expecting a line of space-separated integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the integers from the line of space-separated integers read from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. The map object can be iterated over to access the integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_2` does not take any parameters.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`. Since no information is provided about what `func_1()` returns, the output state is a list containing the values returned by `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list containing the values returned by the function `func_1()`. The final state of the program after `func_2` concludes is a list that is the result of `func_1()`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and contains distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-1`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop, `low` is the index just before the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`, `high` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `n` if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: (pos, pos + 1) if `k` is found in `arr`; otherwise (n, 0) (where `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, and `n` is the length of `arr`)
    #State: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop, `low` is the index just before the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`, and `high` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `n` if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then the condition `arr[low] == k` holds true. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_1` and `func_2` to obtain `n`, `k`, and `arr`. It searches for the first occurrence of `k` in the list `arr` and stores its index in `pos` (or -1 if `k` is not found). It then performs a binary search on `arr` to find the position where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If `k` is found at `low`, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. The final state of the program includes `n` (unchanged), `pos` (index of `k` or -1), `st` (a set of midpoints from the binary search), `low` (the index just before the first occurrence of `k` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements), and `high` (the index of the first occurrence of `k` or `n` if `k` is greater than all elements).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary search algorithm needs more than one swap to find the correct position for the target number `x`. According to the problem description, the program should be able to perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search can find `x`. However, the current implementation only performs a single swap if the target is not found at the `low` position after the binary search loop. This means that for certain permutations, the program will not be able to rearrange the elements correctly to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search, leading to incorrect results.

Example of a failing case:
```
Input:
5
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
3 2
3 2 1

Output:
0
1
3 4
2
2 4
1 5
2
4 5
2 4
1
1 3
```

For the test case:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The program will output:
```
1
4 2
```
However, after performing this swap, the permutation becomes:
```
4 5 1 3 2 6
```
The binary search will still not find `3` at the correct position, as the permutation is not sorted and the binary search algorithm is not designed to work with unsorted arrays. The correct output for this case should involve two swaps to ensure that `3` can be found correctly.
