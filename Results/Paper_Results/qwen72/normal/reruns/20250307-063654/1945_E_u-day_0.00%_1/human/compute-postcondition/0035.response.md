Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2`, `mid`, and `mid`, `low` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `low` is updated to be equal to `mid`, which is `(low + high) // 2`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `pos`, `st`, and `high` remain unchanged.
- The value of `mid` is still `(low + high) // 2`, but since `low` has been updated, `mid` will be recalculated based on the new value of `low` if the code runs again. However, for the current state, `mid` remains the same.
