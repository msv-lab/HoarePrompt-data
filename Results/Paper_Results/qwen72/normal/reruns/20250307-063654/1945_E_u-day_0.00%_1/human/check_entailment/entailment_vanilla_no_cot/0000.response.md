Correctness: **False**

The program provided is incorrect because it does not always ensure that the binary search will find the target value `x` after performing at most 2 swaps. The program only performs a single swap if the binary search does not find `x` in the first attempt. However, the problem statement requires that the solution must be able to rearrange the permutation with up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search finds `x`.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Binary Search Assumption**: The program assumes that a single swap will be enough to align the permutation such that the binary search will find `x`. This is not always the case, as the permutation might require more than one swap to be in a form where binary search can find `x`.

2. **Handling Multiple Swaps**: The program does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary. It only prints a single swap if the binary search does not find `x` on the first attempt.

3. **Correctness of Binary Search**: The binary search logic itself is correct, but the program does not ensure that the permutation is in a state where the binary search will work correctly after the swaps.

To correct the program, you would need to implement logic to determine if and where swaps are necessary, and ensure that the permutation can be made into a form where binary search will find `x` after at most 2 swaps. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, x) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == x:
            pos = i
            break

    # Find the positions where the elements should be swapped
    swaps = []
    if pos != 0:
        # First swap to try to place x in the correct position
        if arr[0] > x:
            swaps.append((1, pos + 1))
            arr[0], arr[pos] = arr[pos], arr[0]
            pos = 0

    if pos != n - 1:
        # Second swap to try to place x in the correct position
        if arr[n - 1] < x:
            swaps.append((n, pos + 1))
            arr[n - 1], arr[pos] = arr[pos], arr[n - 1]
            pos = n - 1

    # Perform binary search
    (low, high) = (0, n)
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > x:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid

    if arr[low] == x:
        print(len(swaps))
        for swap in swaps:
            print(swap[0], swap[1])
    else:
        # If binary search still fails, we need to ensure the correct swaps
        if len(swaps) < 2:
            # Find the correct position for x
            correct_pos = -1
            for i in range(n):
                if arr[i] > x:
                    correct_pos = i
                    break
            if correct_pos != -1:
                swaps.append((correct_pos + 1, pos + 1))
                arr[correct_pos], arr[pos] = arr[pos], arr[correct_pos]
            print(len(swaps))
            for swap in swaps:
                print(swap[0], swap[1])
        else:
            print(2)
            for swap in swaps:
                print(swap[0], swap[1])

# Reading the number of test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_3()
```

This corrected version ensures that the permutation is rearranged with up to 2 swaps to make the binary search successful.
