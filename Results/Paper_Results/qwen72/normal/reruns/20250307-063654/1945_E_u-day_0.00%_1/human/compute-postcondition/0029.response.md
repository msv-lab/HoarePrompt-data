Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is `(n - 1) // 2` or `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `low` is updated to `mid`, which is `(low + high) // 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `pos`, `st`, `high`, `mid`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, so after the update, `low` is now equal to this value.
