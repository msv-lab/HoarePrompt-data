Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-1`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.**

Natural language description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial value. The loop variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration. The variable `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` in the list `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will remain -1.
