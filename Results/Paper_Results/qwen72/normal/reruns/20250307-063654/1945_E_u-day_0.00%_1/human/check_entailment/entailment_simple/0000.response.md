### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_1()` and the permutation `arr` using `func_2()`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - The program searches for the index `pos` of the element `k` in the permutation `arr`.
   - If `k` is found, `pos` is set to the index of `k`; otherwise, `pos` remains `-1`.
   - This part is also correct and necessary for the subsequent steps.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `n - 1`, respectively.
   - It then performs a binary search to find the position `low` where `arr[low]` should be `k` if the permutation were sorted.
   - The binary search loop continues until `low + 1 < high`, which is a standard condition for binary search.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is updated to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`.
   - This part is correct and follows the binary search algorithm.

4. **Output:**
   - After the binary search, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.
   - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `arr[low] != k`, it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a swap between these positions.
   - This part is also correct. The swap is intended to move `k` to the position where the binary search would find it if the permutation were sorted.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is not found in the permutation by printing `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
   - The program ensures that the number of swaps does not exceed 2, which is in line with the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the position of `k` in the permutation and perform the necessary swaps to ensure that the binary search algorithm can find `k` in the correct position. The program handles all the specified cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
