Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2`, `mid`, and `mid`, `low` is 0, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Since `st` already contains `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`, after adding `mid` again, the set `st` will still contain the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid` (sets do not allow duplicate values). The other variables remain unchanged.
