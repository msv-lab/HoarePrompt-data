Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2`, `mid`, and `mid`, `low` is 0, `high` is `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `high` is updated to be the same as `mid`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `pos`, `st`, `low`, `mid`) remain unchanged.
- `high` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2`, which is the same as the value of `mid`.
