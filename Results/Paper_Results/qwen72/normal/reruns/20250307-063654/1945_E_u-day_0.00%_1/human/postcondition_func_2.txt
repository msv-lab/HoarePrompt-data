The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_1` and `func_2` to obtain `n`, `k`, and `arr`. It searches for the first occurrence of `k` in the list `arr` and stores its index in `pos` (or -1 if `k` is not found). It then performs a binary search on `arr` to find the position where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If `k` is found at `low`, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. The final state of the program includes `n` (unchanged), `pos` (index of `k` or -1), `st` (a set of midpoints from the binary search), `low` (the index just before the first occurrence of `k` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements), and `high` (the index of the first occurrence of `k` or `n` if `k` is greater than all elements).
