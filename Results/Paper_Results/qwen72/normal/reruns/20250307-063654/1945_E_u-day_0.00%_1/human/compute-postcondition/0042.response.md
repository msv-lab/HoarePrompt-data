Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
   - `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop.
   - `low` is the index just before the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`.
   - `high` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `n` if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(low + 1, pos + 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `low` is the index just before the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`.
   - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1: `k` is found in `arr`**
     - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k`.
     - `low` is the index just before `pos`.
     - Therefore, `low + 1` will be `pos`.
     - The print statement will output `pos, pos + 1`.
   - **Scenario 2: `k` is not found in `arr`**
     - `pos` is -1.
     - `low` is the last index of `arr` (i.e., `n-1`).
     - Therefore, `low + 1` will be `n`.
     - The print statement will output `n, 0`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - If `k` is found in `arr`, the output will be `pos, pos + 1`.
   - If `k` is not found in `arr`, the output will be `n, 0`.

Output: **(pos, pos + 1) if `k` is found in `arr`; otherwise (n, 0) (where `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, and `n` is the length of `arr`)**
