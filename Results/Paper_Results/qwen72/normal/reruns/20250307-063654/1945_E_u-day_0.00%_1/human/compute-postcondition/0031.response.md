The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `low + 1 < high`. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is 0, and `high` is either `(low + high) // 2` if `arr[mid] > k`, or `(n - 1) // 2` or `n - 1` otherwise. For the loop to execute one more time, `low + 1` must be less than `high`.

Given the state:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `(low + high) // 2` if `arr[mid] > k`, otherwise `low` is `(low + high) // 2` and `high` is `(n - 1) // 2` or `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `n - 1`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `high` must be greater than 1 (since `low` is 0, `low + 1` is 1, and `1 < high` must be true).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `high` is greater than 1. Since `n` is greater than 2, `n - 1` is at least 1, and `(n - 1) // 2` is at least 0.5 (which will be rounded down to 0 in integer division), we need to ensure that `high` is set to a value greater than 1.

If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is set to `(low + high) // 2`, which is 0 if `high` was 1. This does not satisfy the condition for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `high` must be set to a value greater than 1.

If `arr[mid] <= k`, `high` is set to `(n - 1) // 2` or `n - 1`, both of which are greater than 1 since `n` is greater than 2.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to ensure `high` is greater than 1. The simplest way to ensure this is to set `high` to `(n - 1) // 2` or `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is 0, `high` must be greater than 1**
