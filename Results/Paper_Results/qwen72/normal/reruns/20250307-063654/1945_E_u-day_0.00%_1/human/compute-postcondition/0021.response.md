Postcondition: **`n` is the same as the initial value and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
