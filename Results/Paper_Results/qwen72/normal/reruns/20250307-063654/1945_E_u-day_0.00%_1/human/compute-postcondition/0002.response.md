Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` and contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`. `arr` is now the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1.**

The variable `pos` is initialized to -1. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is updated to the list returned by `func_2()`. The list `arr` still represents a permutation of size `n` and contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
