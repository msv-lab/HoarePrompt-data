Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`, `low` is 0, `high` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**

Explanation:
- `mid` is assigned the value `(low + high) // 2`.
- Since `low` is 0 and `high` is greater than 1, `mid` will be the integer division of `high` by 2.
- The set `st` now contains the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged.
