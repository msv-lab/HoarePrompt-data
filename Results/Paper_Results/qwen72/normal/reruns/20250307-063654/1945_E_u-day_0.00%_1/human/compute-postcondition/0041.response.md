Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
   - `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop.
   - `low` is the index just before the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`.
   - `high` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `n` if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer `1`.
   - The values of `n`, `i`, `pos`, `st`, `low`, `high`, and `arr` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` is given, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of the other variables and objects.

Output: **1**
