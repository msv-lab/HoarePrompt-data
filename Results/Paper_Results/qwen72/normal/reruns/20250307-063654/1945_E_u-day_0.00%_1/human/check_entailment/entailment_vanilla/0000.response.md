### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We need to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that binary search can find `x` correctly.
   - The binary search algorithm is described, and it is guaranteed that 2 operations are always sufficient.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers. It is used to read the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. It is used to read the permutation `p`.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - It reads the values of `n` and `x` using `func_1`.
     - It reads the permutation `p` using `func_2`.
     - It finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation `p`.
     - It initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
     - It performs the binary search, adding the middle index to a set `st` to track the indices that have been considered.
     - After the loop, it checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `x`.
     - If `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
     - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it prints `1` and the indices to swap `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Binary Search:**
   - The binary search algorithm is correctly implemented. It correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `x`.
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` ensures that the search narrows down to a single element.

4. **Correctness of the Swap Logic:**
   - The program finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
   - If `x` is not found at `low` after the binary search, it suggests swapping `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
   - This swap ensures that `x` is moved to the position where the binary search would find it.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it correctly reads the input, performs the binary search, and outputs the required swaps.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already at the correct position by printing `0`.
   - It handles the case where `x` is not at the correct position by printing `1` and the indices to swap.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach to solving the problem. It correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation, performs the binary search, and suggests the necessary swap to ensure that `x` is found correctly.

Correctness: **True**
