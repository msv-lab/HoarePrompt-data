Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by looping over the number of test cases and calling `func_3` for each case. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to read the input values for `n` and `k`, and the permutation `arr`, respectively. This is consistent with the problem's input format.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**: The `func_3` function correctly finds the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` and stores it in the variable `pos`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` remains `-1`.

3. **Binary Search**: The binary search is performed correctly to find the position where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The loop continues until `low` and `high` are adjacent, which is a standard termination condition for binary search.

4. **Output**: If `k` is found at the position `low` after the binary search, the program prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed. Otherwise, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, suggesting a single swap to place `k` in the correct position.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where `k` is not found in `arr` by setting `pos` to `-1`. However, the program does not explicitly check for this case before performing the swap. This is a potential issue because if `k` is not in `arr`, the swap operation would be invalid (since `pos` would be `-1`).

6. **Number of Swaps**: The problem states that no more than 2 swaps are allowed. The program only performs 1 swap, which is within the allowed limit. However, the program does not handle cases where more than one swap might be necessary to place `k` in the correct position for the binary search to work correctly.

7. **Correctness of the Swap**: The swap operation is intended to move `k` to the correct position for the binary search. However, the program only swaps `k` with the element at `low + 1`, which might not always result in a correctly sorted segment for the binary search to work as intended. For example, if `k` is the largest element and is not in the first half of the array, the swap might not place `k` in the correct position.

Given these points, the program is **not** fully correct because it does not handle all edge cases and might not always place `k` in the correct position for the binary search to work correctly.

Correctness: **False**
