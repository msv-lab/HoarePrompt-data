The function `func_3` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` and contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `arr`, where `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, and `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
