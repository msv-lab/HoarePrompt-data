### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search, which is only effective on sorted arrays.
   - We are allowed to perform at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation so that binary search can find `x` correctly.
   - It is guaranteed that 2 operations are always sufficient.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers. It is used to read the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. It is used to read the permutation `p`.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - It reads the values of `n` and `x` using `func_1`.
     - It reads the permutation `p` using `func_2`.
     - It finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation `p`.
     - It initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
     - It performs the binary search, adding the middle index to a set `st` to track the indices that have been considered.
     - After the loop, it checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `x`.
     - If `arr[low]` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
     - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it prints `1` and the indices to swap `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Binary Search:**
   - The binary search algorithm is correctly implemented. It correctly updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `x`.
   - The loop condition `while low + 1 < high` ensures that the search narrows down to a single element.

4. **Correctness of the Swap Logic:**
   - The program finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.
   - If `x` is not found at `low` after the binary search, it suggests swapping `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
   - This swap ensures that `x` is moved to the position where the binary search would find it.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it correctly reads the input, performs the binary search, and outputs the required swaps.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already at the correct position by printing `0`.
   - It handles the case where `x` is not at the correct position by printing `1` and the indices to swap.

### Challenges and Issues:
- **Binary Search on Unsorted Permutation:**
  - The binary search is performed on an unsorted permutation, which means it may not always find the correct position of `x` without additional swaps.
  - The program assumes that a single swap will always correct the position of `x` for the binary search to work, which is not necessarily true. For example, if `x` is in a position where it is not the middle element of the sorted segment, a single swap might not be sufficient.

- **Guaranteed 2 Swaps:**
  - The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the program only considers a single swap. This means it might fail in cases where a single swap is not enough to make the binary search work correctly.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `6 3`, `1 2 3 4 5 6`
  - Output: `0`
  - Correct: `x` is already at the correct position.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `6 5`, `3 1 6 5 2 4`
  - Output: `1`, `3 4`
  - Correct: Swapping `3` and `4` (positions 3 and 4) places `5` in the correct position for binary search.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `5 1`, `3 5 4 2 1`
  - Output: `2`, `2 4`, `1 5`
  - Incorrect: The program only suggests a single swap, but 2 swaps are needed here. Swapping `2` and `4` (positions 2 and 4) and then `1` and `5` (positions 1 and 5) would place `1` in the correct position.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `6 3`, `4 3 1 5 2 6`
  - Output: `2`, `4 5`, `2 4`
  - Incorrect: The program only suggests a single swap, but 2 swaps are needed here. Swapping `4` and `5` (positions 4 and 5) and then `2` and `4` (positions 2 and 4) would place `3` in the correct position.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `3 2`, `3 2 1`
  - Output: `1`, `1 3`
  - Correct: Swapping `1` and `3` (positions 1 and 3) places `2` in the correct position for binary search.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is incorrect because it only considers a single swap, which is not always sufficient to ensure that the binary search will find `x` correctly. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program should be able to handle cases where 2 swaps are needed.

Final: **False**
