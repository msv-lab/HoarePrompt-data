Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`.
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which simplifies to `(0 + n - 1) // 2` or `(n - 1) // 2`.
- The set `st` now contains the value `(n - 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged.
