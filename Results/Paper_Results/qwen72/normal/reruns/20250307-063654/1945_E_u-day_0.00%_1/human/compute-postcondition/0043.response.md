Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop, `low` is the index just before the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`, and `high` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `n` if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then the condition `arr[low] == k` holds true. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.***
