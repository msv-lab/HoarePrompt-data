To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition and the program state right before the loop.

### Program State Before the Loop:
- `n` is the same as the initial value.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is an empty set.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while low + 1 < high:
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.
- Before the loop, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`.
- For the loop to execute, the condition `0 + 1 < n - 1` must be true.
- Simplifying the condition: `1 < n - 1` which is equivalent to `n > 2`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2.
- Since `n` is the same as its initial value, we need to ensure that the initial value of `n` is greater than 2.

### Adjusted State:
- The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is the same as the initial value and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set**
