Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2`, `mid`, and `mid`, `low` is 0 or `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is greater than 1, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid] > k`, `low` remains 0 and `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` and `high` remains greater than 1.***
