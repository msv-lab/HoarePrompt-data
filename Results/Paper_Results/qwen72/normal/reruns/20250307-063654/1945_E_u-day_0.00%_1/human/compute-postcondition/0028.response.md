Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is 0, `high` is `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `high` is updated to be equal to `mid`.
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `pos`, `st`, and `low` remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `high` is now `(low + high) // 2`.
