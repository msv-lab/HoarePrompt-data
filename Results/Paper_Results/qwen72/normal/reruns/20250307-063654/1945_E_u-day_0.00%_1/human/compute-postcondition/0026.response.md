Initial State: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`, `low` is 0, `high` is `(n - 1) // 2` or `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.

The code snippet `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
2. The set `st` already contains the value `(n - 1) // 2`.
3. After adding `mid` to `st`, `st` will contain both `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`.

The values of `n`, `i`, `pos`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is 0, `high` is `(n - 1) // 2` or `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
