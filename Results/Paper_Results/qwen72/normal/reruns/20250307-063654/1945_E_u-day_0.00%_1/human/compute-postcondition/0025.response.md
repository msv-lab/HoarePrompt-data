Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`, `low` is 0, `high` is `(n - 1) // 2` or `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.
- If `low` is 0 and `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`, then `mid` becomes `(0 + (n - 1) // 2) // 2`.
- If `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `n - 1`, then `mid` becomes `((n - 1) // 2 + (n - 1)) // 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `pos`, `st`, `low`, `high`) retain their initial values or conditions.
