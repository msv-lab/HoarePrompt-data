Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is an empty set.**

The code snippet initializes an empty set `st`. The values of `n`, `i`, `pos`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `st` being an empty set.
