Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary search algorithm needs more than one swap to find the correct position for the target number `x`. According to the problem description, the program should be able to perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search can find `x`. However, the current implementation only performs a single swap if the target is not found at the `low` position after the binary search loop. This means that for certain permutations, the program will not be able to rearrange the elements correctly to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search, leading to incorrect results.

Example of a failing case:
```
Input:
5
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
3 2
3 2 1

Output:
0
1
3 4
2
2 4
1 5
2
4 5
2 4
1
1 3
```

For the test case:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The program will output:
```
1
4 2
```
However, after performing this swap, the permutation becomes:
```
4 5 1 3 2 6
```
The binary search will still not find `3` at the correct position, as the permutation is not sorted and the binary search algorithm is not designed to work with unsorted arrays. The correct output for this case should involve two swaps to ensure that `3` can be found correctly.
