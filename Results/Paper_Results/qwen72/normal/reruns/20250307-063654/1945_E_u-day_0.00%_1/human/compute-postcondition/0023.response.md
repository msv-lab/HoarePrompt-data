Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `n - 1`.***
