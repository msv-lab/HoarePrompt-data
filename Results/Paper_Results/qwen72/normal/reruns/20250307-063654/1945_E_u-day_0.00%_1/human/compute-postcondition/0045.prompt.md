You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and contains distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is the same as the initial value, `i` is `n-1`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop, `low` is the index just before the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`, `high` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `n` if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: (pos, pos + 1) if `k` is found in `arr`; otherwise (n, 0) (where `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, and `n` is the length of `arr`)
    #State: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop, `low` is the index just before the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`, and `high` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `n` if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then the condition `arr[low] == k` holds true. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `arr`, where `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, and `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
