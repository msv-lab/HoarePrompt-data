Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object. It is used to read the values of `n` and `x` for each test case. This function is correct for its intended purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads another line of space-separated integers and converts it into a list. It is used to read the permutation `p`. This function is also correct for its intended purpose.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is the core of the solution. It performs the following steps:
   - Reads `n` and `x` using `func_1`.
   - Reads the permutation `p` using `func_2`.
   - Finds the index `pos` of `x` in the permutation `p`.
   - Initializes `low` and `high` for binary search.
   - Performs a binary search to find the position where `x` would be if the array were sorted.
   - If `x` is found at `low`, it prints 0 (indicating no swaps are needed).
   - If `x` is not found at `low`, it prints 1 followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` (indicating a single swap is needed to place `x` at the correct position).

However, there are a few issues with the implementation of `func_3`:
   - The binary search is not correctly implemented to handle the permutation. The binary search assumes the array is sorted, but the permutation is not sorted.
   - The function only prints a single swap, but the problem statement allows up to 2 swaps. The function should ensure that the permutation can be made such that `x` is found correctly after the binary search, and it should print up to 2 swaps if necessary.
   - The function does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the permutation, which should not happen according to the problem constraints.

To correct the function, we need to ensure that the permutation can be made such that `x` is found correctly after the binary search. This involves:
   - Finding the correct position of `x` in the sorted permutation.
   - Swapping elements to place `x` at the correct position, using up to 2 swaps if necessary.

Given the current implementation, the function only handles the case where a single swap is needed, and it does not ensure that the permutation is correctly rearranged to meet the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect** based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **False**
