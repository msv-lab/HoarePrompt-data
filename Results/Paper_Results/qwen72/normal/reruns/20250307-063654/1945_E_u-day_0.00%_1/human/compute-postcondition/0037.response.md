Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop, `low` is the index just before the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`, `high` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `n` if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The size of the array `arr` remains unchanged.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` is still `n-1`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`pos`**: The value of `pos` remains the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. This variable is not affected by the loop.
- **`st`**: The set `st` contains all the midpoints calculated during the loop. Each midpoint is added to `st` in each iteration.
- **`low` and `high`**: The loop continues to narrow down the search range until `low + 1 >= high`. At this point:
  - `low` will be the index just before the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or the last index if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`.
  - `high` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `n` if `k` is greater than all elements in `arr`.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
