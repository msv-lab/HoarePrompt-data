Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + (m - 1) + sum((n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) for i in range(1, m - 1)), `i` is `m - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `m`, `x` is `n` - ((m - 1) * (m - 2)), `y` is (m - 1) * (m - 1).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These remain the same as they were in the initial state, i.e., they are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
- **`cnt`**: After the loop completes, `cnt` is the sum of `n` plus the number of iterations (which is `m - 1`) plus the sum of the integer divisions of `n - (i * i - i)` by `i * i` for each `i` from 1 to `m - 2`, plus the additional 1 for each iteration where `i > 1`.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be `m - 1` after the loop completes, as the loop runs from 1 to `m - 1`.
- **`m`**: The value of `m` remains unchanged.
- **`x`**: The final value of `x` is `n` minus the expression `(i * i - i)` evaluated at `i = m - 1`, which simplifies to `n - ((m - 1) * (m - 2))`.
- **`y`**: The final value of `y` is `i * i` evaluated at `i = m - 1`, which simplifies to `(m - 1) * (m - 1)`.
