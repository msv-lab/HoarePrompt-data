The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 1, because `range(1, m)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `m`. If `m` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute. 

Since `n` and `m` are positive integers and `cnt` is 0, these conditions are already given and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the loop to start, `i` must be 1, and `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1**
