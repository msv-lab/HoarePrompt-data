Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). 

Let's break down the provided functions and their logic:

### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. The function is correct and returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

### Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`
This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic in this function does not correctly implement the required conditions.

1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates from \(1\) to \(m-1\). This is incorrect because \(b\) should range from \(1\) to \(m\), inclusive.
   - The variable `x` is calculated as \(n - (i * i - i)\).
   - The variable `y` is calculated as \(i * i\).
   - The count `cnt` is incremented by \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\).

2. **Condition Check**:
   - If `cnt` is \(0\), the function returns \(1\). This is a special case, but it is not clear why this special case is necessary.
   - Otherwise, the function returns `cnt`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The formula \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
  \[
  a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
  \]
  for some integer \(k\). This implies:
  \[
  a = (k \cdot b - 1) \cdot \gcd(a, b)
  \]
  For \(a\) to be a valid integer, \((k \cdot b - 1)\) must be an integer, and \(a\) must be within the range \(1 \le a \le n\).

- The current implementation in `func_2` does not correctly check this condition. It uses a different formula involving \(x\) and \(y\) which does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. However, this approach would be inefficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\).

A more efficient approach involves using properties of the GCD and modular arithmetic to count the valid pairs. The current implementation in `func_2` does not use these properties correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
