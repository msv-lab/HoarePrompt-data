Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1(a, b)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD function.
- The function returns the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
- The function iterates over `i` from 1 to \(m-1\).
- For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y` as follows:
  - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
  - `y = i * i`
- It then adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\) to `cnt`.
- If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1.
- Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Verification of the Logic:
- The logic in `func_2` does not directly address the problem statement. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the function is performing a different calculation.
- The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not seem to be related to the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
- The addition of `(i > 1)` in the count is also not clear and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Example Verification:
- For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the correct output should be 14, as listed in the example. However, the logic in `func_2` does not match the conditions required to produce this output.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The provided solution does not match the problem's requirements and is therefore incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
