Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `x` is `n`, `y` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `cnt` by adding the result of `x // y` and `(i > 1)`. Given that `x` is `n` and `y` is 1, `x // y` is equal to `n`. Since `i` is 1, `(i > 1)` evaluates to `False`, which is 0 in integer context. Therefore, `cnt` is updated to `n + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
