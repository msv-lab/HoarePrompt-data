Reasoning: 

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The function is not used in the main logic of `func_2`, which is a significant oversight.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs using a formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\), which is not the correct approach to find all valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - The formula used inside the loop, `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, and the addition `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`, does not correctly count the valid pairs.
   - For example, in the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
     - The valid pairs should be (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2).
     - However, the function `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs and produces an incorrect result.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations for `func_1` are correct and describe the state and behavior of the function accurately.
   - The annotations for `func_2` are misleading and do not accurately describe the intended logic of the function. The state and calculations described do not align with the problem's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate. The function `func_2` does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem description.

Final: **False**
