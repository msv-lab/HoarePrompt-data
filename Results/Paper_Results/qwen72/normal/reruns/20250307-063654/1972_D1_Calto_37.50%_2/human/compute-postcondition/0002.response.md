Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n - 0` which is `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`. Since `i` is 1, `(i * i - i)` evaluates to `1 * 1 - 1`, which is 0. Therefore, `x` is equal to `n - 0`, which simplifies to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
