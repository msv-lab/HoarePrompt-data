Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1 + (`n` - 2) // 4 + 1 + (`n` - 6) // 9 + 1, `i` is 3, `m` is greater than 3, `x` is `n` - 6, `y` is 9.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated to `cnt` + `x` // `y` + (`i` > 1).
- `x` is `n` - 6.
- `y` is 9.
- `x` // `y` is (`n` - 6) // 9.
- `i` is 3, so (`i` > 1) evaluates to 1.
- Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is `n` + 1 + (`n` - 2) // 4 + 1 + (`n` - 6) // 9 + 1.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
