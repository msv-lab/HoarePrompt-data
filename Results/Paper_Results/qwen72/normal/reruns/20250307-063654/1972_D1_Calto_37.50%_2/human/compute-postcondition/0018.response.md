The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function has two possible return values based on the input:

- Case_1: The function returns 1.
- Case_2: The function returns the value of `cnt`, which is calculated as `n` + (m - 1) + sum((n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) for i in range(1, m - 1)), where `cnt` is not equal to 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It returns 1 in one case. In another case, it returns a calculated value `cnt` which is the sum of `n`, `m - 1`, and a series of integer divisions based on a formula involving `n` and `m`.**
