The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2, and `m` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is `n`, `y` is 1**
