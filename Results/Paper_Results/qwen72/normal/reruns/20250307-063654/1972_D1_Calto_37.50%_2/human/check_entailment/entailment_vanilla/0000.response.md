Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function is correct and correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`
Let's break down the logic of this function:
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
- For each \(i\), it calculates:
  - \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\)
  - \(y = i \cdot i\)
- It updates the counter `cnt` by adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\).
- If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1.
- Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Range for \(b\)**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, m)` should be `for i in range(1, m + 1)` to include \(b = m\).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\)**:
   - The calculation \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) is not correct. This does not align with the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Incorrect Update of `cnt`**:
   - The update `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` is not correct. The term \((i > 1)\) is added without a clear reason, and the division \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor\) does not correspond to the problem's conditions.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair \((a, b)\), check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Reading input
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# Printing results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
