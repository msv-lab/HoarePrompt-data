Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is `n` - 2, `y` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `n - (i * i - i)`.
- Since `i` is 2, `i * i - i` equals `2 * 2 - 2` which is 2.
- Therefore, `x` becomes `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `cnt`, `i`, `y`) remain unchanged.
