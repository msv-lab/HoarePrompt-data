You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0; `a` and `b` are still positive integers such that 1 <= `a` <= `n` and 0 <= `b` <= `m`.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, where `a` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `a` <= `n` and `b` is 0. Since the GCD of any positive integer `a` and 0 is `a` itself, the program returns `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` with constraints 1 <= `a` <= `n` and 1 <= `b` <= `m`. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. After the function concludes, `a` holds the GCD of the initial `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)

    return cnt
    #The program returns the value of `cnt`, which is calculated as `n` + (m - 1) + sum((n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) for i in range(1, m - 1)), where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and `cnt` is not equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It calculates a value `cnt` based on a series of integer divisions and additions. If `cnt` is 0, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `n`, `m - 1`, and a series of integer divisions derived from a formula involving `n` and `m`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function is correct and correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`
Let's break down the logic of this function:
- It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
- It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
- For each \(i\), it calculates:
  - \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\)
  - \(y = i \cdot i\)
- It updates the counter `cnt` by adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\).
- If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1.
- Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Range for \(b\)**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, m)` should be `for i in range(1, m + 1)` to include \(b = m\).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\)**:
   - The calculation \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) is not correct. This does not align with the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Incorrect Update of `cnt`**:
   - The update `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` is not correct. The term \((i > 1)\) is added without a clear reason, and the division \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor\) does not correspond to the problem's conditions.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair \((a, b)\), check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Reading input
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# Printing results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
