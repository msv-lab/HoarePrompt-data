### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The function correctly returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Function 2**:
   - `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\):
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)` calculates \(n - (i^2 - i)\).
     - `y = i * i` calculates \(i^2\).
     - `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` adds the integer division of `x` by `y` to `cnt`, and also adds 1 if \(i > 1\).
   - After the loop, if `cnt` is 0, the function returns 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The loop in `func_2` is not correctly implementing the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the loop.
   - The loop seems to be based on some derived formula, but it is not clear how this formula relates to the problem statement.
   - The logic inside the loop and the final return statement do not align with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**False**
