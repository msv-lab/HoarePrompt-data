Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It calculates a value `cnt` based on a series of integer divisions and additions. If `cnt` is 0, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `n`, `m - 1`, and a series of integer divisions derived from a formula involving `n` and `m`. **
