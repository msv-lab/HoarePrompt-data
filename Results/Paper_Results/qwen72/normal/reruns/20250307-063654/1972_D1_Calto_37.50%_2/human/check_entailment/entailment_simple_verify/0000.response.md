### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the issues with the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function is not used in `func_2`, which is a significant oversight since the GCD is a crucial part of the problem's condition.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function attempts to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) but uses a formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\), which is not the correct range for \(b\). The correct range for \(b\) should be from 1 to \(m\).
   - The calculation inside the loop, `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, and the subsequent addition to `cnt` are not derived from the problem's conditions. The formula used does not correctly determine whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs. It uses a formula that does not match the problem's conditions, leading to incorrect results.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - `func_1(a, b)` is called with positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
  - `func_2(n, m)` is called with positive integers \(n\) and \(m\) such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).

- **Inside `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly computes the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).
  - The final state is that `a` is the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.

- **Inside `func_2`**:
  - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\), which is incorrect. It should iterate from 1 to \(m\).
  - The calculation `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly determine the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The addition `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` is not derived from the problem's conditions and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The function `func_2` uses a formula that does not align with the problem's requirements, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
