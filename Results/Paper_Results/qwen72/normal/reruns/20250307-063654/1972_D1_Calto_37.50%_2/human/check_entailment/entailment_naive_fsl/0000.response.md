Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The function `func_2` appears to have a flawed approach and does not correctly count the valid pairs for all inputs.

For example, consider the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\). According to the problem description, the valid pairs should be (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3). However, the function `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs. The function `func_2` is attempting to use a formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.

To verify this, let's manually check the pairs:
- For (1, 1): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\), so \(2\) is a multiple of \(1\).
- For (2, 1): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\), so \(3\) is a multiple of \(1\).
- For (2, 2): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\), so \(4\) is a multiple of \(4\).
- For (2, 3): \(2 + 3 = 5\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\), so \(5\) is not a multiple of \(3\).

The correct output for \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\) should be 3, but the provided function `func_2` does not produce this result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
