Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1 + (`n` - 2) // 4 + 1, `i` is 3, `m` is greater than 3, `x` is `n` - 6, `y` is 9.**

The code snippet `y = i * i` updates the value of `y` to be the square of `i`. Since `i` is 3, `y` becomes 9. The values and conditions of the other variables remain unchanged.
