### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
     ```python
     def func_1(a, b):
         while b:
             (a, b) = (b, a % b)
         return a
     ```
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. However, the logic inside `func_2` is flawed.
     ```python
     def func_2(n, m):
         cnt = 0
         for i in range(1, m):
             x = n - (i * i - i)
             y = i * i
             cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
         if cnt == 0:
             return 1
         return cnt
     ```

3. **Flawed Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) and \(y\) using the formula \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then adds \(x // y\) to `cnt` and an additional 1 if \(i > 1\).
   - Finally, if `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

4. **Validation of the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - Let's manually check the pairs for \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
     - For \(b = 1\):
       - \(x = 2 - (1 * 1 - 1) = 2\)
       - \(y = 1 * 1 = 1\)
       - \(cnt = cnt + 2 // 1 + 0 = 2\)
     - For \(b = 2\):
       - \(x = 2 - (2 * 2 - 2) = 0\)
       - \(y = 2 * 2 = 4\)
       - \(cnt = cnt + 0 // 4 + 1 = 3\)
     - For \(b = 3\):
       - The loop only goes up to \(m-1\), so \(b = 3\) is not considered.
     - The final `cnt` is 3, which is incorrect because the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2), not including (2, 3).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided `func_2` does not perform this check correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem description.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
