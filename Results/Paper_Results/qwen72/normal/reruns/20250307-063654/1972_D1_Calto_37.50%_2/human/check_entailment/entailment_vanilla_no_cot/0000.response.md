Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - However, it is not used in the `func_2` function, which is supposed to solve the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function is intended to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions.
   - However, the logic inside the function is flawed. The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly reflect the condition that `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` should be checked for each pair `(a, b)` in the range `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
   - The current logic in `func_2` does not perform this check and instead uses a different, incorrect formula.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
- **GCD Calculation**: The `gcd` function correctly calculates the GCD of `a` and `b`.
- **Pair Counting**: The `count_valid_pairs` function iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges and checks if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling the `count_valid_pairs` function and printing the result.

This approach ensures that the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case.
