### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues in the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Range for \(b\)**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, m)` should indeed be `for i in range(1, m + 1)` to include \(b = m\). This is a critical oversight as it means the function is not considering all possible values of \(b\).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\)**:
   - The calculation \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) is not aligned with the problem's requirement. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), not some arbitrary subtraction and division.

3. **Incorrect Update of `cnt`**:
   - The update `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` is not correct. The term \((i > 1)\) is added without a clear reason, and the division \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor\) does not correspond to the problem's conditions.

The original assessment also provides a correct approach to solving the problem, which involves iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary for `func_2` states:
- The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).
- It calculates a value `cnt` based on a series of integer divisions and additions.
- If `cnt` is 0, the function returns 1.
- Otherwise, it returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `n`, `m - 1`, and a series of integer divisions derived from a formula involving `n` and `m`.

This summary does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. The formula and the logic used in `func_2` are not aligned with the condition that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the function summary supports the conclusion that the function is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid and the suggested correct approach is appropriate.

Final: **False**
