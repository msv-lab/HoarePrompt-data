Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is `n` + 1 + (`n` - 2) // 4 + 1, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `x` is `n` - 2, `y` is 4**

Explanation:
- `cnt` was initially `n` + 1.
- `x` is `n` - 2.
- `y` is 4.
- The expression `x // y` calculates the integer division of `x` by `y`, which is (`n` - 2) // 4.
- The expression `(i > 1)` evaluates to 1 because `i` is 2.
- Therefore, `cnt` is updated to `n` + 1 + (`n` - 2) // 4 + 1.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
