The provided code snippet introduces a type variable `T` using `TypeVar` from the `typing` module. However, this does not affect the values of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. The type variable `T` is used for type hinting and does not change the state of the program in terms of the values of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `v` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and `T` is a type variable.**
