Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the number of outcomes `n`, and the multipliers `k` for each outcome. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, n, k):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of outcomes for each test case, and `k` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`bets` remains the same, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and each element `a[j]` in the list `a` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`bets` remains the same, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `g` is 1, `l` has at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no additional changes are made to `ans`. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of all elements in `a` separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`bets` remains the same, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, bets - 1]`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of `a[j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, bets - 1]`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `g` is 1, `l` has at least `len(l)` elements. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, ..., `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
