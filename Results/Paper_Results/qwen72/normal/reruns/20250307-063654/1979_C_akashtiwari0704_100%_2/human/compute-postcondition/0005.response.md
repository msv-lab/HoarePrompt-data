The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `l`. If `i` is less than the length of `l`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `l` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `l` must have at least two elements.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `l[0] // gcd(1, l[0])`, `l` must have at least two elements, `i` is 1**
