Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[1]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[1]` to `sumo`. Since `i` is 1, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
