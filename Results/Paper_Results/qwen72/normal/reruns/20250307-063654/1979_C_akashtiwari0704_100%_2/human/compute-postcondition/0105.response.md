Postcondition: **`bets` remains the same, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, bets - 1]`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of `a[j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, bets - 1]`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `g` is 1, `l` has at least `len(l)` elements, `ans` remains unchanged, and `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
