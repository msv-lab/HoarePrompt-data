The function `lcm` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers. The function returns the product of all elements in the list `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd) with `g` at each step. Given the parameter constraints, `t` must be greater than 0, and `T` is 0, but these constraints do not directly affect the functionality of the function as described.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `l` of integers and returns the product of all elements in `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd) with `g` at each step.**
