Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, each element `a[j]` in the list `a` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space.**
