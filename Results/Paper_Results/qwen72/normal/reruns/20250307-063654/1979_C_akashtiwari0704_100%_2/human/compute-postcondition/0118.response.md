Output State: **`bets` remains the same, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is the initial value of `t`, `T` is `t - 1`, `g` is 1, `l` has at least `len(l)` elements, `a[j]` is `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, bets - 1]`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of `a[j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, bets - 1]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, ..., `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, and `sumo` is less than `prod`.**

Explanation:
- `bets` remains the same throughout all iterations because it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is `bets - 1` after each iteration of the inner loop, and this is true for all iterations.
- `t` is the initial value provided, and it remains unchanged because it is only used in the loop condition.
- `T` is `t - 1` after the loop has completed all iterations, as `T` increments from 0 to `t - 1`.
- `g` is reset to 1 at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop.
- `l` is not directly used in the loop but is mentioned in the `lcm` function, which requires at least `len(l)` elements to compute the LCM.
- `a[j]` is modified to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, bets - 1]` in each iteration, and this transformation is applied to the same list `a` in each iteration.
- `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in the list `a` and remains the same for each test case.
- `sumo` is the sum of the transformed values of `a[j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, bets - 1]`.
- If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the output is `-1` and no further changes are made to `ans`.
- If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of the transformed `a[j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, bets - 1]`, each followed by a space.
