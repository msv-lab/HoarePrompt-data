The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `bets` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `bets` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]`**
