Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[1]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`**

Explanation:
- The code `a[i] = prod // a[i]` updates the value of `a[2]` to `prod // a[2]` because `i` is 2.
- The values of `bets`, `i`, `a[0]`, and `a[1]` remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
- `sumo` is still increased by the integer value of `a[1]`, as this condition was already true in the initial state.
