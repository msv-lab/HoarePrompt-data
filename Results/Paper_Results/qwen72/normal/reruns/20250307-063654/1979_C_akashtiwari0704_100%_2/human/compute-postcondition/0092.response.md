The provided code snippet reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns it to the list `a`. This impacts the initial state by updating the value of `a`. The other variables (`bets`, `i`, `t`, `T`, `g`, `l`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `g` is 1, `l` has at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `ans` is a string containing the values of all elements in `a` separated by spaces if `sumo` is less than `prod`, otherwise no additional changes are made to `ans`.**
