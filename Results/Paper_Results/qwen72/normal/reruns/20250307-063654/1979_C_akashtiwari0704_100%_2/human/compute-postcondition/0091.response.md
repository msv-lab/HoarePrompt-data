Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `g` is 1, `l` has at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no additional changes are made to `ans`. If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of all elements in `a` separated by spaces.**
