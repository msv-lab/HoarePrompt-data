Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`.
- The values of `bets`, `i`, `a[0]`, and `sumo` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- `sumo` is still increased by the integer value of `a[0]`, which is `prod // a[0]`.
- `a[1]` is now equal to `prod // a[1]`.
