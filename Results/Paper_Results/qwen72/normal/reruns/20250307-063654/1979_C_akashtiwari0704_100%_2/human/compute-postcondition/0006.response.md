Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, `l` must have at least two elements, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `T` remains 0.
- `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`. The initial value of `g` was `l[0] // gcd(1, l[0])`, and now it is multiplied by `l[1]` and divided by the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[1]`.
- `l` still has at least two elements.
- `i` remains 1.
