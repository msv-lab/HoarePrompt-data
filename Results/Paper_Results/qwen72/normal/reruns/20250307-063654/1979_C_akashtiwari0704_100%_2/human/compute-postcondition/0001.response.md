The only objects in the loop head are the variables `T` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the function `func` is properly defined with parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `T` is now 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0**
