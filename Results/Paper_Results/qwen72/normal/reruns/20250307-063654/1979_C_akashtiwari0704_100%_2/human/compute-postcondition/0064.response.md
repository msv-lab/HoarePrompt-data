Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 1, `T` is 1, `g` is 1, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is `prod // a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` followed by a space.**
