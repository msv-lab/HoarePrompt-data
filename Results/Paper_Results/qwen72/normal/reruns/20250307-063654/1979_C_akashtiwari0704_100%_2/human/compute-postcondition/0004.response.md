Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `l[0] // gcd(1, l[0])`, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
- Initially, `g` is 1 and `i` is 0.
- Therefore, `g` becomes `1 * l[0] // gcd(1, l[0])`, which simplifies to `l[0] // gcd(1, l[0])`.
- Since the greatest common divisor (gcd) of any number and 1 is 1, `g` is now `l[0] // 1`, which is simply `l[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `T`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.
