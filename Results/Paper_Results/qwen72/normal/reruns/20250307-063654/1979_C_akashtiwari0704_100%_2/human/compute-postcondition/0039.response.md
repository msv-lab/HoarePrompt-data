Postcondition: ***`bets` remains the same, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and each element `a[j]` in the list `a` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` followed by a space.***
