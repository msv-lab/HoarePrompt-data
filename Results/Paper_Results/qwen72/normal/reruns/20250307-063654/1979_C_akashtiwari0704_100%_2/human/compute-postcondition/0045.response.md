Output State: **`bets` remains the same, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `T` is 1, `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, `l` must have at least 2 elements, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and each element `a[j]` in the list `a` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing all elements of `a` followed by a space.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
