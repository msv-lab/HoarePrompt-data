Precondition: **The function `func` is not properly defined in the provided function definition. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the number of outcomes `n`, and the multipliers `k` for each outcome. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, n, k):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of outcomes for each test case, and `k` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for each outcome.**
