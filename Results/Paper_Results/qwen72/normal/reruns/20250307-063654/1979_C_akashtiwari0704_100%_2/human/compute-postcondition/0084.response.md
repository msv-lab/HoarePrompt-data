Output State: **`bets` remains the same, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, `l` must have at least 2 elements, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of all elements in `a` separated by spaces; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor function.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
