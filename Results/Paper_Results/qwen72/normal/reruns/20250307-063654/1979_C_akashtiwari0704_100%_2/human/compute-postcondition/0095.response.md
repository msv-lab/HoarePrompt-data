To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables `i` and `bets` as they are the only ones in the loop head. The loop will execute if `bets` is greater than 0. The initial state of `i` is given as `bets - 1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head, so we do not need to adjust it. 

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
