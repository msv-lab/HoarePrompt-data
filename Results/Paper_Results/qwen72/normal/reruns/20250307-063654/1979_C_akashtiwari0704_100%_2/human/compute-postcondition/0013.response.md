Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements.** 

The variable `bets` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The states of the other variables (`t`, `T`, `g`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
