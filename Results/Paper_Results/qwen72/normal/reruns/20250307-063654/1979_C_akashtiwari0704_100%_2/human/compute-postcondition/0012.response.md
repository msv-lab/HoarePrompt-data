Functionality: ** The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all the elements in the list. The function modifies the variable `g` to compute the LCM iteratively, but does not alter the input list `l`. After the function concludes, `g` holds the LCM of the elements in `l`, and the input list `l` remains unchanged. **
