Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[2]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 2.
- The variable `sumo` is incremented by the integer value of `a[2]`.
- The values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` remain as `prod // a[0]`, `prod // a[1]`, and `prod // a[2]` respectively.
- The condition that `bets` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
