The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of the element at index `i` of the list `a` followed by a space to the string `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `bets` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `T` is 0
- `g` is 1
- `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`
- `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`
- Each element `a[j]` in the list `a` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`
- `sumo` is less than `prod`
- `ans` is a string containing the first and second elements of `a` followed by a space

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` will now contain the first, second, and third elements of `a` followed by a space.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, each element `a[j]` in the list `a` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the first, second, and third elements of `a` followed by a space.**
