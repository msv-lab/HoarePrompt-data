Output State: **`bets` remains the same, `i` is `bets - 1`, `t` must be greater than 1, `T` is 1, `g` is 1, `l` must have at least `len(l)` elements, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` is now `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`. `ans` is an empty string.**
