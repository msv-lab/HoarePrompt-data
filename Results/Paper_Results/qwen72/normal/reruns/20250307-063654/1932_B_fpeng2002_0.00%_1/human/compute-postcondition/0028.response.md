Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 3, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[-1]` that is greater than or equal to the cumulative result of the smallest multiples of all previous elements in `nums`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `num_tests` is decremented by 1, so it has now been decremented by 3 in total.
- The values of `n`, `nums`, `start_year`, and `x` remain unchanged.
