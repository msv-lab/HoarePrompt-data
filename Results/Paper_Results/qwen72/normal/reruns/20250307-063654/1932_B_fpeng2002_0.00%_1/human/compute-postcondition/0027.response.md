The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must still be greater than 0 after the decrement.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[-1]` that is greater than or equal to the cumulative result of the smallest multiples of all previous elements in `nums`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**
