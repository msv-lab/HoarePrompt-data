### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed step-by-step verification of the program's logic and output for each test case. Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotated version and the original assessment to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0. This is the correct initial state, as we start counting from year 0.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates through each sign in the list `nums`.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     ```python
     start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the current year (`start_year + 1`), and it finds the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`.
   - This part of the program is also correct and matches the problem description.

### Verification Using Annotated Code:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
  - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before the function call.

- **State of the program during the loop:**
  - For each sign, the program updates `start_year` to the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year + 1`.
  - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program during the loop.

- **State of the program after the loop:**
  - After processing all signs for a test case, `start_year` is the year in which the n-th sign occurs.
  - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program after the loop.

### Test Case Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Initial `start_year` is 0.
  - For `a_1 = 3`:
    - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For `a_2 = 2`:
    - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - For `a_3 = 4`:
    - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - For `a_4 = 5`:
    - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - For `a_5 = 9`:
    - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - For `a_6 = 18`:
    - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36`
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `1 2 3 4 5`
  - Initial `start_year` is 0.
  - For `a_1 = 1`:
    - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - For `a_2 = 2`:
    - `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
  - For `a_3 = 3`:
    - `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - For `a_4 = 4`:
    - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
  - For `a_5 = 5`:
    - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - Output: `5`
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
  - Initial `start_year` is 0.
  - For `a_1 = 1`:
    - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
  - For `a_2 = 1`:
    - `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
  - For `a_3 = 1`:
    - `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
  - For `a_4 = 1`:
    - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
  - For `a_5 = 1`:
    - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
  - Output: `5`
  - This matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Initial `start_year` is 0.
  - For `a_1 = 50`:
    - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
  - For `a_2 = 30`:
    - `start_year = ((50 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
  - For `a_3 = 711`:
    - `start_year = ((60 + 1) // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
  - For `a_4 = 200`:
    - `start_year = ((711 + 1) // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
  - For `a_5 = 503`:
    - `start_year = ((800 + 1) // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
  - For `a_6 = 1006`:
    - `start_year = ((1006 + 1) // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012`
  - This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen. The logic ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one, and the formula used is appropriate for finding the next occurrence year.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
