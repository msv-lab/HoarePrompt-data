Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the previous elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n` based on the input provided.
- The value of `num_tests` remains greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2.
- The list `nums` is still a list of `n` integers provided as input, but `n` now has the new input value.
- The variable `start_year` remains the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the previous elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 1.
- The variable `x` remains `len(nums) - 1`, which is the length of the list `nums` minus 1.
