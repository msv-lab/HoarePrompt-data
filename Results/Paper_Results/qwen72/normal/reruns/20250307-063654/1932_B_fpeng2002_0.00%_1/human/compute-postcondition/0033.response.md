The code snippet modifies the value of `start_year` based on the value of `nums[x]`, where `x` is 0. The calculation involves incrementing `start_year` by 1, performing integer division by `nums[0]`, adding 1 to the result, and then multiplying by `nums[0]` again. 

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `x` is 0.

Let's break down the impact of the code:
1. `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`.
2. `x` remains 0.
3. `nums` remains the same list of `n` integers.
4. `n` remains greater than 0.

The value of `start_year` is now the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than `start_year`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than `start_year`.**
