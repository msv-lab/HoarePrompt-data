Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input where `n` must be greater than 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, `x` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`.
- The values of `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged.
