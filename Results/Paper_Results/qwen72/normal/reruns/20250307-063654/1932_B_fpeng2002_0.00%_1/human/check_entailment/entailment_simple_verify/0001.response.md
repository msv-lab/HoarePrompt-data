Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The key formula used in the loop:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```
ensures that the next sign occurs in the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`. This formula is broken down as follows:
- `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign must occur strictly after the current year.
- `// nums[x]` performs integer division to find the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` that fit into `start_year + 1`.
- `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
- `* nums[x]` calculates the actual year of the next occurrence.

The program processes each test case correctly and prints the final `start_year` for each test case. The test cases provided in the original assessment are correctly verified, and the program produces the expected outputs.

Final: **True**
