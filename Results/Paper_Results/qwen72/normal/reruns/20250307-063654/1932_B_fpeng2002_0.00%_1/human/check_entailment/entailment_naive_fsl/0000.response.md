Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the sequential occurrence rule as described in the problem statement. The program processes each test case by iterating through the list of sign periodicities, updating the `start_year` to the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula used, `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, correctly calculates the next occurrence year for each sign, taking into account the requirement that the next sign must occur strictly after the previous one. The program handles all edge cases, including when the periodicity of signs is 1, and it works for any valid input within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
