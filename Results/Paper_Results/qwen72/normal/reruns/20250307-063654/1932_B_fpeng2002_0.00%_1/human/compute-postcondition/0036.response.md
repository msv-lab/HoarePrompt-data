The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums` and the value of `x`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1, meaning `nums` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, and `nums` must still have at least 2 elements.

State: **`nums` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.**
