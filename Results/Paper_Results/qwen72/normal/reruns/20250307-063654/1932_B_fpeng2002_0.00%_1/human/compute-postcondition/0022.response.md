Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input where `n` must be greater than 1, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.
- The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]` calculates the next multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.
- The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, `x`) remain unchanged.
