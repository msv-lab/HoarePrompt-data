To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
```

The variables and objects in the loop head are:
- `x`
- `nums`

The loop will execute if the range `range(0, len(nums))` has at least one element. This means that `len(nums)` must be greater than 0. 

Given the initial state:
- `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 3 (this is not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is the new input integer (this is not directly relevant to the loop head, but it determines the length of `nums`).
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input.
- `start_year` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop head).
- `x` is `len(nums) - 1` (this is not relevant to the loop head, as `x` will be reinitialized by the loop).

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `nums` has at least one element. This means `n` must be greater than 0, and `nums` must be a list of at least one integer.

State: **`nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is 0**
