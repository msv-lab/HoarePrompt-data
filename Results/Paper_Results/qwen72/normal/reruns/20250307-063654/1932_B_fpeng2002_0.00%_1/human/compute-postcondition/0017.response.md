Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the previous elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**

The code snippet `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]` updates the `nums` list to contain `n` integers provided as input. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, `start_year`, and `x` remain unchanged, but `x` is now equal to the length of the new `nums` list minus 1.
