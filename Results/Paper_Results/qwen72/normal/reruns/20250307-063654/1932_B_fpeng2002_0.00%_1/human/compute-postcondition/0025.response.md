Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[-1]` that is greater than or equal to the cumulative result of the smallest multiples of all previous elements in `nums`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `num_tests` remains greater than 0 but has been decremented by 2.
- The value of `n` is still the new input integer, and `nums` is still the list of `n` integers provided as input.
- The value of `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the cumulative result of the smallest multiples of all the previous elements in `nums`.
- The value of `x` is the index of the last element in `nums`, which is `len(nums) - 1`.
