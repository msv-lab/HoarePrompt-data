Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input.
4. `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the previous elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 1.
5. `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`num_tests`**: This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the output.
2. **`n`**: This is the length of the list `nums`.
3. **`nums`**: This is a list of `n` integers.
4. **`start_year`**: This variable is defined based on the elements of `nums`. Specifically, it is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the previous elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 1.
5. **`x`**: This is the index of the last element in the list `nums`, which is `len(nums) - 1`.

### Calculation of `start_year`:
- **Smallest multiple of the last element in `nums`**: Let's denote the last element of `nums` as `nums[x]` or `nums[-1]`.
- **Smallest multiple of the previous elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 1**: We need to find the smallest multiple of each element in `nums` except the last one that is greater than or equal to 1. This is essentially the smallest multiple of each element, which is the element itself if it is positive.
- **Combining the two conditions**: `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[-1]` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the previous elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 1.

### Example Calculation:
Suppose `nums = [2, 3, 4, 5]`:
- The last element is `5`.
- The previous elements are `[2, 3, 4]`.
- The smallest multiple of each of these elements that is greater than or equal to 1 is the element itself: `2, 3, 4`.
- The smallest multiple of `5` that is greater than or equal to the maximum of `2, 3, 4` (which is 4) is `5`.

### General Case:
- If the last element of `nums` is `nums[-1]` and the maximum of the previous elements is `max(nums[:-1])`, then `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[-1]` that is greater than or equal to `max(nums[:-1])`.

### Final Output:
The `print(start_year)` statement will print the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the maximum of the previous elements in `nums`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the maximum of the previous elements in `nums`)**
