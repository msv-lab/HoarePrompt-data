Output State: **`nums` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `start_year` to the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.
- The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` calculates the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.
- The values of `nums`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.
