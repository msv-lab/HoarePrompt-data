The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function processes each test case and returns the result based on the input values.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the input values.**
