Output State: **The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

The value of `n` is now an input integer, and the other conditions remain unchanged.
