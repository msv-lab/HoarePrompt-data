Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It processes each test case by reading the number of signs and their periodicities, then calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The logic used in the loop to update `start_year` ensures that the signs occur in the required sequence, and the final `start_year` value for each test case is printed as the year of the apocalypse. The program's approach and implementation are consistent with the problem's requirements and constraints.
