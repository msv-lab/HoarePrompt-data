Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the sequential occurrence rule as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization**: The `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is the correct starting point for the calculations.

3. **Loop through Signs**: The program iterates through each sign's periodicity in the list `nums`. For each sign, it updates `start_year` to the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

4. **Formula Explanation**: The formula used, `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, works as follows:
   - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the current `start_year`.
   - `// nums[x]` performs integer division, which gives the number of complete cycles of `nums[x]` that fit into `start_year + 1`.
   - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
   - `* nums[x]` calculates the actual year of the next occurrence.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When the periodicity of signs is 1, the formula correctly updates `start_year` to the next year.
   - For any valid input within the specified constraints, the formula ensures that the signs occur in the correct sequence and the final `start_year` is the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

6. **Output**: The program prints the calculated year for each test case, which is the correct output format.

The program handles all the given examples and edge cases correctly. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.

Final: **True**
