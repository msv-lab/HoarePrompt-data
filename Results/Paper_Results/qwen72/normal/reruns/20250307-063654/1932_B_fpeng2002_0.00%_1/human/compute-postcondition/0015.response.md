Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the previous elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**

Explanation:
- `num_tests` was initially greater than 0 and had been decremented by 1. After the code `num_tests -= 1` is executed, it is decremented by an additional 1, making it decremented by 2 in total.
- The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `start_year`, and `x`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
