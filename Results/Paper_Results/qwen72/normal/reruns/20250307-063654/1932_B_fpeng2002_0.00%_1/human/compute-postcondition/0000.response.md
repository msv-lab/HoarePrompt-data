The code snippet `num_tests = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `num_tests`. The `input()` function accepts an input, and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that the function should be called with a list of test cases, but this state is not directly affected by the code snippet provided. The only change is the assignment of `num_tests`.

Output State: **The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). `num_tests` is an input integer.**
