Output State: **`nums` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is 1, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.**

Explanation: The code updates `start_year` to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`. The other variables (`nums`, `n`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
