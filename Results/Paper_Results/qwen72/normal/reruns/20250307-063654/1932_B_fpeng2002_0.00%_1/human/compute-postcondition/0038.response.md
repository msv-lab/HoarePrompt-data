Output State: **`nums` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `nums` remains unchanged and still contains `n` integers.
- The variable `n` is still greater than 0, indicating that the list `nums` is not empty.
- The variable `x` is now equal to `len(nums) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `nums`.
- The variable `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the `start_year` value from the previous iteration. This process is applied sequentially for each element in the list `nums` from the first to the last.
