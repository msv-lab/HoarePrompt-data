The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The list `nums` must still have at least 1 element for the loop to potentially execute again, but since `x` is now 2, `nums` must have at least 2 elements to ensure the loop can proceed.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input that must have at least 2 elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 2**
