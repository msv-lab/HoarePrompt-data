Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 3, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[-1]` that is greater than or equal to the cumulative result of the smallest multiples of all previous elements in `nums`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `num_tests` remains greater than 0 and has been decremented by 3.
- `n` is still the new input integer.
- `nums` is now a list of `n` integers provided as input.
- `start_year` is still the smallest multiple of `nums[-1]` that is greater than or equal to the cumulative result of the smallest multiples of all previous elements in `nums`.
- `x` is now equal to `len(nums) - 1`, which is the length of the new list `nums` minus 1.
