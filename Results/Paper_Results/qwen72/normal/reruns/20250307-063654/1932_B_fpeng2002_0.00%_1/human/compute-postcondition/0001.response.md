The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

State: **The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
