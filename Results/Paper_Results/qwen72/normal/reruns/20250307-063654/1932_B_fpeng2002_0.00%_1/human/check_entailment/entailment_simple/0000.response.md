### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the list of periodicities, `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is the starting point for calculating the year when the signs occur.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates through each sign's periodicity in `nums`.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, strictly after the previous sign has occurred.
   - The formula used is `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`:
     - `start_year + 1` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the current year.
     - `// nums[x]` finds the number of complete cycles of the current sign's periodicity that fit into the current `start_year`.
     - `+ 1` ensures that we move to the next cycle.
     - `* nums[x]` calculates the exact year when the next sign will occur.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which is the year when the last sign will occur.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly, as it will simply print the periodicity of the single sign.
   - The program also handles the case where all periodicities are 1, as it will correctly print the year `n` (since each sign will occur in consecutive years).

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the first test case: `3 2 4 5 9 18`
     - The first sign occurs in year 3.
     - The second sign occurs in year 4.
     - The third sign occurs in year 8.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 10.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 18.
     - The sixth sign occurs in year 36.
   - For the second test case: `1 2 3 4 5`
     - The first sign occurs in year 1.
     - The second sign occurs in year 2.
     - The third sign occurs in year 3.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.
   - For the third test case: `1 1 1 1 1`
     - The first sign occurs in year 1.
     - The second sign occurs in year 2.
     - The third sign occurs in year 3.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.
   - For the fourth test case: `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
     - The first sign occurs in year 50.
     - The second sign occurs in year 60.
     - The third sign occurs in year 711.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 800.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 1006.
     - The sixth sign occurs in year 2012.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula used is mathematically sound and handles all edge cases as expected.

Correctness: **True**
