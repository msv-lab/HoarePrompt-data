To determine what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `nums` is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is greater than 0.
   - `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, which means `x` is the index of the last element in the list `nums`.
   - `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.

2. **Understanding `start_year`:**
   - The last element in `nums` is `nums[x]` or `nums[-1]`.
   - `start_year` is defined as the smallest multiple of `nums[-1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.
   - This implies that `start_year` is calculated based on a previous value of `start_year` and the last element of `nums`.

3. **Calculation of `start_year`:**
   - Let's denote the last element of `nums` as `last_num`.
   - The previous `start_year` is not explicitly given, so we assume it is some initial value.
   - The new `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `last_num` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(start_year)` statement will print the value of `start_year` which is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.

Since the exact initial value of `start_year` and the elements of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `start_year`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the calculated `start_year`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year`)**
