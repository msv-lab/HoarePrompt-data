Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). `num_tests` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the previous elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[-1]` that is greater than or equal to the cumulative result of the smallest multiples of all previous elements in `nums`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
