Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the cumulative result of the smallest multiples of all previous elements in `nums`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `num_tests` is 0 because the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `n` is the input integer for the last test case processed.
- `nums` is the list of `n` integers provided as input for the last test case.
- `start_year` is the final computed value for the last test case, which is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the cumulative result of the smallest multiples of all previous elements in `nums`.
- `x` is `len(nums) - 1` because the loop has completed its final iteration, and `x` is at the last index of `nums`.
