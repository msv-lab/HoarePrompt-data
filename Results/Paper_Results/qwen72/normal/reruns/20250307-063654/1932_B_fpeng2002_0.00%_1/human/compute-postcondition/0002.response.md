The value of `num_tests` is decremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
