Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the previous elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `num_tests` is still greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1.
- The variable `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- The list `nums` remains unchanged, containing `n` integers.
- The variable `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the previous elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to 1.
- The variable `x` is now equal to `len(nums) - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
