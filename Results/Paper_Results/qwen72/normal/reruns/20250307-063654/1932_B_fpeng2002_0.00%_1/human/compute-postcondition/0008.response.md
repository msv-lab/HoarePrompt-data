The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `nums`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, and `nums` must still have at least 1 element.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 1**
