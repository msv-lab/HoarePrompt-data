The only objects in the loop head are variables `x` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `num_tests` being greater than 0 and having been decremented by 1, `n` being an input integer, and `start_year` being 0 do not affect the loop's execution directly.

For the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least one element, and `x` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is 0, `x` is 0**
