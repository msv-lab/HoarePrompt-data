Reasoning:  
The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. Here's a breakdown of how the function works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Test Cases**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `num_tests`. It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums` representing the periodicities of the signs.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which represents the year before the first sign occurs.
   - For each sign, the function calculates the next occurrence year that is a multiple of the current sign's periodicity and is greater than or equal to the year after the previous sign's occurrence. This is done using the formula:
     \[
     \text{start_year} = \left(\left(\text{start_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[x] + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[x]
     \]
     - \(\text{start_year} + 1\) ensures that the next year is considered after the previous sign's occurrence.
     - \(\left(\text{start_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[x]\) finds the number of complete cycles of the current sign's periodicity that have occurred by the year \(\text{start_year} + 1\).
     - Adding 1 to the result of the division ensures that the next cycle starts.
     - Multiplying by \(\text{nums}[x]\) gives the year when the next cycle of the current sign occurs.

4. **Output**: After calculating the year for the n-th sign, the function prints this year.

5. **Loop Termination**: The loop continues until all test cases are processed, and `num_tests` becomes 0.

The function correctly implements the logic to find the year when the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The use of the formula ensures that the calculated year is the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than or equal to the cumulative result of the previous signs.

Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
