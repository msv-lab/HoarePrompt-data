Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input, `start_year` is 0, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`**

The code sets `start_year` to 0, overriding its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. `num_tests` is still greater than 0 but has been decremented by 2, `n` is still the new input integer, `nums` is still a list of `n` integers provided as input, and `x` is still `len(nums) - 1`.
