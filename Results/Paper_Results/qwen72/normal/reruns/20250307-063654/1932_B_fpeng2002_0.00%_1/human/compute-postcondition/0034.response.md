The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and the list `nums`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop head will change.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is 0.
- `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than `start_year`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop head `for x in range(0, len(nums))` must still be valid. This means:
- `x` must be incremented by 1.
- `len(nums)` must be greater than `x` for the loop to continue.

Given that `x` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, `len(nums)` is at least 1, and the loop will execute again if `len(nums)` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`nums` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is 1, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than `start_year`**
