Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 1**

Explanation:
- `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.
- The initial `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1.
- The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
