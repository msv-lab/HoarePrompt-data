Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers provided as input where `n` must be greater than 0, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is 0**

Explanation:
- `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 1. This is calculated as `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, where `start_year` was initially 0 and `x` is 0.
- The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
