The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust these two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `low + 1 < high`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `n` must be greater than 2, `st` contains the value `n // 2` and `mid`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.

Given the condition `low + 1 < high`:
- If `low` is 0 and `high` is `(low + high) // 2`, then `high` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
- If `low` is `(low + high) // 2` and `high` is `n`, then `low` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute again.

Since `i` is `n-1` and `n` must be greater than 2, `high` is `n`, and `low` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `low` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `n` must be greater than 2, `st` contains the value `n // 2` and `mid`, `low` must be less than `n - 1`, and `high` is `n`**
