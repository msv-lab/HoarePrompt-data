Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `n` must be greater than 2, `st` contains the value `n // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `low` is `mid`, and `high` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `low` is updated to be equal to `mid`.
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, but since `low` has just been updated to `mid`, `mid` remains the same.
- All other variables (`i`, `pos`, `n`, `st`, and `high`) retain their initial values and conditions.
