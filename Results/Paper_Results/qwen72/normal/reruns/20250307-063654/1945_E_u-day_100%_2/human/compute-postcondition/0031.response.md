Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `n` must be greater than 2, `st` contains the value `n // 2`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `low` must be less than `n - 1`, and `high` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is updated to the result of `(low + high) // 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `pos`, `n`, `st`, `low`, and `high`) retain their initial values or conditions.
