### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search.
   - Before performing the binary search, we are allowed to swap elements at most twice to ensure the binary search works correctly.
   - The binary search algorithm is described as follows:
     - Initialize `l = 0` and `r = n`.
     - While `r - l > 1`, compute `m = (l + r) // 2`.
     - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`; otherwise, set `r = m`.
     - After the loop, `p[l]` should be equal to `x`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This is used to read the values of `n` and `x`.
   - **func_2**: Reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This is used to read the permutation `p`.
   - **func_3**: This function performs the main logic:
     - It reads `n` and `x` using `func_1`.
     - It reads the permutation `p` using `func_2`.
     - It finds the position of `x` in `p` and stores it in `pos`.
     - It performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= x`.
     - If `arr[low] == x`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
     - If `arr[low] != x`, it prints `1` followed by the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a swap.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Finding `x` in `p`**: The function correctly finds the position of `x` in the permutation `p` and stores it in `pos`.
   - **Binary Search**:
     - The binary search is performed correctly to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= x`.
     - If `arr[low] == x`, the function correctly prints `0` because no swaps are needed.
     - If `arr[low] != x`, the function prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to swap the elements at these positions.
   - **Swapping**:
     - The function only prints one swap, which is within the allowed limit of 2 swaps.
     - The swap is intended to move `x` to the correct position where the binary search would find it.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function `func_3` assumes that `x` is always present in the permutation `p`. If `x` is not present, the function will not work correctly.
   - The binary search logic is correct, but the swap logic might not always ensure that `x` is found correctly after the swap. For example, if `x` is not in the correct position after the swap, the binary search might still fail.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_3` does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the permutation `p`.
   - The swap logic is not robust enough to ensure that the binary search will always find `x` after the swap.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the permutation `p`, and the swap logic might not always ensure that `x` is found correctly after the swap.
