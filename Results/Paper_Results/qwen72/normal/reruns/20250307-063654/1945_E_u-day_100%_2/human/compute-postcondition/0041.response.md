Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`: This means `i` is the last index of the list `arr`.
   - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
   - `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`.
   - `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`.
   - `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged: This means `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`: This implies that `arr[low]` is less than `k`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(low + 1, pos + 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`. Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it must be less than `k`.
   - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains -1.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - `low + 1`: This will be the value of `low` incremented by 1.
   - `pos + 1`: If `k` is found, `pos` will be a valid index, and `pos + 1` will be that index incremented by 1. If `k` is not found, `pos` will be -1, and `pos + 1` will be 0.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `k` is found in `arr`, the output will be the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
   - If `k` is not found in `arr`, the output will be the value of `low + 1` and 0.

Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **(low + 1, pos + 1) (where low is the largest index such that arr[low] <= k and pos is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr if k is found, otherwise pos is -1)**
