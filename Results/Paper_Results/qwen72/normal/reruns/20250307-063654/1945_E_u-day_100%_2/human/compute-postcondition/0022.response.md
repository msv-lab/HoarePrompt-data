Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is `n // 2`, `high` is `n`, `st` contains the value `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.**

The value of `low` is updated to `n // 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
