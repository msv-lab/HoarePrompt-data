Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` contains the value `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `n // 2`.** 

The set `st` now contains the value `n // 2`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
