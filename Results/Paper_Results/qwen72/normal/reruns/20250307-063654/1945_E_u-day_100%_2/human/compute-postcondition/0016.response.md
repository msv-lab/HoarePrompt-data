To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `low + 1 < high`.

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`
- `st` is an empty set

Let's analyze the condition `low + 1 < high`:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`

For the loop to execute, the condition `0 + 1 < n` must be true, which simplifies to `1 < n` or `n > 1`.

Since `n` is the only variable that affects the loop condition, and it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the modified state is:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set, and `n` must be greater than 1**
