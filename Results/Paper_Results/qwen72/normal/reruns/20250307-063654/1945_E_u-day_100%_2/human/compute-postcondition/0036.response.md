Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop, and `n` remains unchanged.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`i`**: This variable remains `n-1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`pos`**: This variable remains the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, it remains -1. The loop does not change this value.
- **`low`**: After the loop finishes, `low` will be the largest index in the array such that `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`.
- **`high`**: After the loop finishes, `high` will be the smallest index in the array such that `arr[high]` is greater than `k`.
- **`st`**: This set will contain all the indices that were checked during the loop, which are the midpoints calculated in each iteration.
- **`n`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
