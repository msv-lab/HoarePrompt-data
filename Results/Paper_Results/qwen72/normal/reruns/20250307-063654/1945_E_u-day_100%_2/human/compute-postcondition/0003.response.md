The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `arr` and `pos` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
