Functionality: ** The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It internally calls `func_1` to get two integers `n` and `k`, and `func_2` to get a list `arr` of integers representing a permutation of size `n`. The function then searches for the integer `k` in `arr`. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Here, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. The function modifies the internal state by setting `pos` and performing a binary search to determine `low` and `high`. The final state of the program includes `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and a set `st` containing the indices checked during the binary search. **
