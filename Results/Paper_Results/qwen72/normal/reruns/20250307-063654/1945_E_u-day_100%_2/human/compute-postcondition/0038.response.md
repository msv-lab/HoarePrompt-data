Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n-1`.
2. `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
3. `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`.
4. `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`.
5. `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop.
6. `n` remains unchanged.
7. `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `0`.
- The initial state provides information about various variables and the list `arr`, but none of these variables or the list `arr` are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will output the integer `0` regardless of the values of `i`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`, `n`, or `arr`.

### Output:
Output: **0**
