The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the permutation.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n.
- `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`.
- `pos` is an integer that will store the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found.

The function returns:
- Case_1: If `k` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of `k` in `arr`.
- Case_2: If `k` is not found in `arr`, the function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (an integer between 1 and `n`), `arr` (a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`), and `pos` (an integer). It returns the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, it returns -1.**
