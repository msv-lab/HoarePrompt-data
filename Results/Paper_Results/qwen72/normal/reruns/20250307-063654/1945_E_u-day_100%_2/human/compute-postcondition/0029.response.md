Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `n` must be greater than 2, `st` contains the value `n // 2` and `mid`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid] > k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `(low + high) // 2` and `high` is `n` if `arr[mid] > k`; otherwise, `high` is `n`.***
