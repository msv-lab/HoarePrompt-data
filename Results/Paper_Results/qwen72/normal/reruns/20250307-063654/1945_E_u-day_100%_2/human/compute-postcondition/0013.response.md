Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `arr`. The variable `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of the value `k` in the list `arr`, if `k` is found in `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will remain -1, indicating that `k` is not present in the list.
