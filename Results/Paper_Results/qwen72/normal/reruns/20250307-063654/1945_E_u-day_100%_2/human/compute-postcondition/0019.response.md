Postcondition: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` contains the value `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, and the element at index `mid` in `arr` is greater than `k`.**
