### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running a binary search.
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation to find the position of `x`.
   - The goal is to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search in Permutations**:
   - Binary search works correctly on sorted arrays, but the permutation is not guaranteed to be sorted.
   - The binary search algorithm in the problem is slightly different from the standard binary search. It uses `l = 1` and `r = n + 1` and the loop condition is `r - l = 1`.
   - This means the binary search will always narrow down to a single element, but it may not be the correct element if the permutation is not sorted.

3. **Swapping Elements**:
   - The key to solving this problem is to ensure that the element `x` is in the correct position after the binary search.
   - The binary search will always end with `l` being the index where the element `x` should be if the permutation were sorted.
   - To achieve this, we need to swap the element `x` to the correct position `l` if it is not already there.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This is used to read the number of test cases and the permutation.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This is used to read the permutation.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: 
     - Reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to find `k`.
     - Reads the permutation `arr`.
     - Finds the position `pos` of the number `k` in the permutation.
     - Initializes `low` and `high` for the binary search.
     - Performs the binary search to find the position `low` where `k` should be if the permutation were sorted.
     - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it means the binary search found the correct position, and no swaps are needed.
     - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it prints one swap operation to move `k` to the position `low`.

5. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies the position `pos` of the number `k` in the permutation.
   - The binary search is performed correctly to find the position `low` where `k` should be.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, the program prints a single swap operation to move `k` to the position `low`.
   - The program does not handle the case where more than one swap might be needed, but the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program only needs to ensure that `k` is in the correct position after the binary search.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach to solve the problem as described. It ensures that the element `x` is in the correct position after the binary search, which is the goal of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
