Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` as returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is an integer that will store the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_1()`, and this remains unchanged.
- The variable `arr` is updated to the list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` as returned by `func_2()`.
- The variable `pos` is still an integer that will store the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, but its value has not been changed by the code snippet.
