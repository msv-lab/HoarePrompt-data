Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set, `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` which is `n // 2`.**

The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2, resulting in `n // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
