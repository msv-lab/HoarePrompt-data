Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` as returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1.**

The initial state is updated such that `pos` is now set to -1, indicating that it will store the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
