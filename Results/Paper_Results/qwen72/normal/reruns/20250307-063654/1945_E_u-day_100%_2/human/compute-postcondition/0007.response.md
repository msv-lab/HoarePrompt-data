The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, so `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `pos` remains unchanged**
