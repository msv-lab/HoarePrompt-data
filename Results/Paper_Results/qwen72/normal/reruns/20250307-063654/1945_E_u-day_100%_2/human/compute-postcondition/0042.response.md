Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop, `n` remains unchanged, and `arr[low]` is equal to `k` if the condition `arr[low] == k` is true, otherwise `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.***
