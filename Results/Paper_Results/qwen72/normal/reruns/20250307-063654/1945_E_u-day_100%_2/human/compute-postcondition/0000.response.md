Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and `pos` is an integer that will store the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the return values of `func_1()`. The other variables, `arr` and `pos`, retain their initial properties and purposes as described in the initial state.
