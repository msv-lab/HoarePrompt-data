Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is `n // 2` if `arr[mid] > k`; otherwise, `high` is `n`, `st` contains the value `n // 2` and `mid`, `n` must be greater than 2, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `low` is updated to be equal to `mid`, which is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
