Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by calling `func_3()`. Each test case involves reading two integers `n` and `k` (using `func_1()`) and a permutation of size `n` (using `func_2()`).

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**: The program iterates through the permutation to find the index of `k` and stores it in `pos`. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains `-1`.

3. **Binary Search**: The program performs a binary search on the permutation, which is not guaranteed to be sorted. The binary search is implemented correctly in terms of the logic for updating `low` and `high` based on the comparison with `k`.

4. **Output**: After the binary search, the program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. If it is, it prints `0` (indicating no swaps were needed). If not, it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` (indicating a single swap to place `k` at the correct position).

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Binary Search on Unsorted Array**: Binary search is designed to work on sorted arrays. Since the permutation is not guaranteed to be sorted, the binary search may not find the correct position of `k` even if `k` is present in the array. This is a fundamental flaw in the algorithm.

- **Handling `pos == -1`**: If `k` is not found in the permutation, `pos` remains `-1`. In this case, the program will print `low + 1` and `0`, which is incorrect because the problem specifies that `1 \le i, j \le n`.

- **Multiple Swaps**: The problem allows for up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running the binary search. The program only attempts to make one swap, which might not be sufficient to ensure the binary search works correctly.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the unsorted nature of the permutation and does not ensure that the binary search will find the correct position of `k` after at most 2 swaps.

Correctness: **False**
