Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` contains the value `n // 2` and `mid`, `n` must be greater than 2, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `high` is updated to the value of `mid`, which is `(low + high) // 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `pos`, `low`, `st`, `n`, and `mid`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `high` was either `n // 2` or `n`, depending on the condition `arr[mid] > k`. After the update, `high` is now `(low + high) // 2`, which is the same as the value of `mid`.
