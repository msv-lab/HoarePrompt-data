Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n // 2` if `arr[mid] > k`; otherwise, `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`, `st` contains the value `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.
