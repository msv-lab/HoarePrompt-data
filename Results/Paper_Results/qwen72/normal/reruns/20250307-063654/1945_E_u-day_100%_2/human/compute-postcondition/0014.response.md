Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`.**

The code snippet assigns the values 0 and `n` to the variables `low` and `high`, respectively. The values of `i` and `pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `low` and `high`, along with the unchanged values of `i` and `pos`.
