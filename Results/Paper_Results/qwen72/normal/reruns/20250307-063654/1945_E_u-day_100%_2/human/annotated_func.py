#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any arguments and is used to read input from the user, converting it into a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts the input from the user into a list of integers. The input is expected to be a string of numbers separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the user, which is expected to be a string of numbers separated by spaces. It then returns a map object that converts each number in the string into an integer. The map object can be iterated over to access the integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_2` does not take any parameters.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the initial state, the exact contents of the list cannot be determined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_1()`. The exact contents of the list are unknown as `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and pos is an integer that will store the index of k in arr if k is found.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop, and `n` remains unchanged.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: - If `k` is found in `arr`, the output will be the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
        #   - If `k` is not found in `arr`, the output will be the value of `low + 1` and 0.
        #
        #Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:
        #
        #Output:
    #State: *`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop, `n` remains unchanged, and `arr[low]` is equal to `k` if the condition `arr[low] == k` is true, otherwise `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It internally calls `func_1` to get two integers `n` and `k`, and `func_2` to get a list `arr` of integers representing a permutation of size `n`. The function then searches for the integer `k` in `arr`. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Here, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. The function modifies the internal state by setting `pos` and performing a binary search to determine `low` and `high`. The final state of the program includes `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and a set `st` containing the indices checked during the binary search.
