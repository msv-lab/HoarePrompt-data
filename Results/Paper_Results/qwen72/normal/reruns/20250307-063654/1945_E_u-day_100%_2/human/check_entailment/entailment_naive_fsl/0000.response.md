Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement to perform at most 2 swaps to make the binary search work. The program only performs 1 swap, and there are cases where 2 swaps are necessary to achieve the correct result.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
5 3
4 1 5 2 3
```
The correct output should be:
```
2
4 5
2 4
```
However, the program will output:
```
1
2 4
```
This is incorrect because after the swap, the array becomes `[4, 3, 5, 2, 1]`, and the binary search will not find the correct position for `3`. The binary search will end with `low = 1` and `arr[1] = 3`, but the correct position for `3` should be `low = 4` after the necessary swaps. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
