Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up the Problem**:
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which are then used to initialize `n` and `k`.
   - `func_2` reads another line of input and converts it into a list of integers, which is used to initialize `arr`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`**:
   - The function `func_3` iterates through the list `arr` to find the index of `k` and stores it in `pos`. If `k` is not found, `pos` remains -1.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The function performs a binary search on the unsorted permutation `arr` to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k` and the smallest index `high` such that `arr[high] > k`.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1` is equal to `high`.

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, the function prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, the function prints `1` followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, indicating one swap is needed to place `k` at the correct position.

5. **Correctness of the Binary Search**:
   - The binary search is performed correctly, but it is applied to an unsorted permutation. The goal is to find the correct position for `k` in the sorted order, which the binary search does.
   - However, the function only prints the indices for one swap, even if more than one swap might be necessary to place `k` in the correct position. The problem statement allows up to 2 swaps, but the function only considers one swap.

6. **Handling the Case Where `k` is Not Found**:
   - If `k` is not found in `arr`, the function will print `1` followed by `low + 1` and `0`, which is incorrect because `pos` should be a valid index in the permutation.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle the case where `k` is not in `arr` correctly. It should print `2` and the necessary swaps to place `k` in the correct position, but it only prints `1` and an invalid swap.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_3` does not meet the problem's requirements in all cases, particularly when `k` is not found in `arr` or when more than one swap is needed.

Correctness: **False**
