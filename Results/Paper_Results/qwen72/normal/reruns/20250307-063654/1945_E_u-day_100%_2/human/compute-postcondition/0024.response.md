The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust these two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `low + 1 < high`. At the end of the last iteration, `low` is 0, and `high` is `n // 2` if `arr[mid] > k`; otherwise, `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`. Given that `mid` is `n // 2`, we need to ensure that `low + 1 < high` holds true for the next iteration.

- If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is 0 and `high` is `n // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `low + 1` must be less than `high`, which means `1 < n // 2`. This implies `n` must be greater than 2.
- If `arr[mid] <= k`, then `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`. For the loop to execute again, `low + 1` must be less than `high`, which means `n // 2 + 1 < n`. This is always true for `n > 1`.

Since `n` must be greater than 1, and we need to ensure the loop condition holds true, we adjust the state to reflect the necessary condition for `low` and `high`.

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n // 2` if `arr[mid] > k`; otherwise, `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`, `st` contains the value `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, and `mid` is `n // 2`.**
