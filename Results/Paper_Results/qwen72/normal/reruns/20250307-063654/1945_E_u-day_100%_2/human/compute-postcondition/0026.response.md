Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n // 2` if `arr[mid] > k`; otherwise, `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`, `st` contains the value `n // 2` and `mid`, `n` must be greater than 2, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is added to the set `st`.
- `st` now contains the value `n // 2` and `mid`.
- All other variables (`i`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, `n`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
- `mid` is still calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
