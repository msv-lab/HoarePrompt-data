Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

# Annotated Functions:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any arguments and is used to read input from the user, converting it into a list of integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts the input from the user into a list of integers. The input is expected to be a string of numbers separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the user, which is expected to be a string of numbers separated by spaces. It then returns a map object that converts each number in the string into an integer. The map object can be iterated over to access the integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function `func_2` does not take any parameters.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling the function `func_1()`. Since `func_1()` is not defined in the initial state, the exact contents of the list cannot be determined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_1()`. The exact contents of the list are unknown as `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and pos is an integer that will store the index of k in arr if k is found.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop, and `n` remains unchanged.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: - If `k` is found in `arr`, the output will be the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
        #   - If `k` is not found in `arr`, the output will be the value of `low + 1` and 0.
        #
        #Given the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:
        #
        #Output:
    #State: *`i` is `n-1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the indices that were checked during the loop, `n` remains unchanged, and `arr[low]` is equal to `k` if the condition `arr[low] == k` is true, otherwise `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It internally calls `func_1` to get two integers `n` and `k`, and `func_2` to get a list `arr` of integers representing a permutation of size `n`. The function then searches for the integer `k` in `arr`. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Here, `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1. The function modifies the internal state by setting `pos` and performing a binary search to determine `low` and `high`. The final state of the program includes `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and a set `st` containing the indices checked during the binary search.
