### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the input matrix `xx`.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.

2. **Counting Known Transitions:**
   - The program iterates through the input matrix and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each known transition (either 'F' or 'S').
   - This step ensures that the program has a correct count of the transitions that are already decided.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - This step correctly identifies scenarios with only one type of transition.

4. **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
   - The program decides which type to assign to the undecided transitions based on the size of `sa` and `sb`.
   - If `sa` is larger or equal to `sb`, it adds scenarios with no known transitions to `sa` and assigns 'F' to the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` and 'S' to the rest.
   - If `sb` is larger, it adds scenarios with no known transitions to `sb` and assigns 'S' to the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` and 'F' to the rest.
   - This logic is intended to balance the number of consecutive funny or scary transitions, but it is not sufficient to ensure the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.

5. **Output the Full Transition Plan:**
   - The program prints the full transition plan, ensuring that the symmetry property (i.e., `xx[i][j] == xx[j][i]`) is maintained.
   - However, the assignment of 'F' and 'S' to the undecided transitions is not robust enough to guarantee the constraint for all permutations.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry Property:**
  - The program correctly maintains the symmetry property of the transition matrix.

- **Handling Known Transitions:**
  - The program correctly handles and keeps track of known transitions.

- **Assigning Undecided Transitions:**
  - The program's approach to assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions is not robust. It simply assigns the first `n // 4` elements to one type and the rest to the other type, which may not always ensure the required constraint is met.
  - For example, if the input is such that the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `sb` are not well-distributed, it could lead to a permutation where more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type occur.

- **Permutation Constraint:**
  - The program does not explicitly check all permutations of scenarios to ensure that no permutation results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type. This is a critical part of the problem that the program fails to address.
  - The constraint requires that for any permutation of the scenarios, the number of consecutive transitions of the same type should not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\). The current logic does not guarantee this for all permutations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios is satisfied. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
