Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `b[1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[1]` by 1, as `i` is 1. The initial state specifies that if the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', `a[1]` and `a[2]` are incremented by 1, and if it is 'S', `b[1]` and `b[2]` are incremented by 1. However, the code snippet provided only increments `b[1]` by 1, so the character at index 0 of `x` must be 'S'. The values of `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the state of `x` is still an input string. The value of `b[2]` is not affected by this code snippet.
