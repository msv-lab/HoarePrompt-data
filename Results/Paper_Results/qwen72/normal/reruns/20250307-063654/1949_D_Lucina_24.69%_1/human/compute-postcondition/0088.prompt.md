Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the integer value provided by the input, the input is a list of n strings, each of length n, containing characters 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', and the character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j, and at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'. `a` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements set to 0. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements set to 0. `xx` is a list containing an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, for each index `k` from 0 to `n-1` in `x`, if the character at index `k` is 'F', both `a[1]` and `a[k+1]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `k` is 'S', both `b[1]` and `b[k+1]` are incremented by 1. The values of `a` and `b` at all other indices remain unchanged. `xx` is a list that now includes the input string `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n`, `xx` is a list that now includes the list `x`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged at all other indices.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x` and the input string `x`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged at all other indices, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
