Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than 0.
2. `j` is `n + 1`.
3. `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined as follows:
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', the character is `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`, the character is 'S'.
   - Otherwise, the character is 'F'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nx)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `j`**:
   - `j` is defined as `n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `j` will always be greater than `n`.

2. **Determine the value of `nx`**:
   - `nx` is a string of length `n`.
   - For each character in `nx` at index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`):
     - We need to check the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.
     - Since `j = n + 1`, `j - 1 = n`.
     - Therefore, we are checking the value of `xx[i][n]`.

3. **Evaluate the conditions for each character in `nx`**:
   - If `xx[i][n]` is not equal to '?', the character in `nx` at index `i` is `xx[i][n]`.
   - If `xx[i][n]` is equal to '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`, the character in `nx` at index `i` is 'S'.
   - Otherwise, the character in `nx` at index `i` is 'F'.

4. **Summarize the output**:
   - The output will be a string `nx` of length `n`.
   - Each character in `nx` will be determined based on the conditions described above.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `xx` and `sb` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions. The string `nx` will be constructed as follows:
- For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
  - If `xx[i][n]` is not '?', the character is `xx[i][n]`.
  - If `xx[i][n]` is '?' and either `i` or `n` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, the character is 'S'.
  - Otherwise, the character is 'F'.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n, and each character is determined by the conditions: if xx[i][n] is not '?', the character is xx[i][n]; if xx[i][n] is '?' and either i or n is in the first n // 4 elements of sb, the character is 'S'; otherwise, the character is 'F')**
