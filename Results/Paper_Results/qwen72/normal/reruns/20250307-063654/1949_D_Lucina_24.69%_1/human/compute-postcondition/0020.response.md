Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `b[1]` is incremented by 1, `b[2]` is incremented by 1.**

The value of `b[2]` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state indicates that `b[1]` was already incremented by 1, and now `b[2]` is also incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `j`, `i`, and `x` are not affected by this code.
