Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3. If the element at index 2 of the list `x` is 'F', the element at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1, and the element at index 3 of the list `a` is incremented by 1, while the lists `b` and the element at index 0 of the list `x` remain unchanged. If the element at index 2 of the list `x` is 'S', the element at index 3 of the list `b` is incremented by 1, and the lists `a` and the element at index 0 of the list `x` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the element at index 1 of the list `b` remains unchanged, and the conditions for `x` and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
