Postcondition: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial input, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings provided during the loop execution. `i` is `n + 1`. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, and `nx` is a string of length `n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the character is the one at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), the character is 'F'; otherwise, the character is 'S'. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, `nx` is a string of length `n` for each iteration of `i` from 1 to `n`, where each character in `nx` is determined as follows: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', the character is `xx[i][j - 1]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`, the character is 'S'; otherwise, the character is 'F'.**
