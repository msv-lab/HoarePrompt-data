The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `j` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `j` is now 3 and the loop condition is `j < n + 1`).

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged at all other indices, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input string. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', the value of `a` at index 2 is increased by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', the value of `b` at index 2 is increased by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
