Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. Additionally, `i` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, and `j` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.**
