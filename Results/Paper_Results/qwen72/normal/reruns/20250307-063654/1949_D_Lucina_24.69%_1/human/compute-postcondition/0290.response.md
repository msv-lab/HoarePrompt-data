Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` for each iteration of `i` from 1 to `n`, where each character in `nx` is determined as follows: If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', the character is `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`, the character is 'S'. Otherwise, the character is 'F'.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive.
- **`nx`**: For each value of `i` from `1` to `n`, the string `nx` is constructed by iterating through the characters in the string at index `i` in `xx` (from position `0` to `n - 1`). The characters in `nx` are determined based on the following rules:
  - If the character in `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it is directly appended to `nx`.
  - If the character in `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`, the character 'S' is appended to `nx`.
  - If the character in `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`, the character 'F' is appended to `nx`.

This process is repeated for each `i` from `1` to `n`, resulting in `n` strings being printed, each of length `n`.
