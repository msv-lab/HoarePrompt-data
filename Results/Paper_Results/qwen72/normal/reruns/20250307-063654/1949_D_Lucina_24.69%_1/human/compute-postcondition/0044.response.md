The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `j`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'F', the element at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'S', the element at index 1 of the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the element at index 1 of the list `b` remains unchanged.**
