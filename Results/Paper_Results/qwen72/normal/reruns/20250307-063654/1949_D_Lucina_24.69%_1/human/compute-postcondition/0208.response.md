The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `sb` is a list that now contains the elements 1 and 2 if the second element of `a` is 0 and the second element of `b` is 0; otherwise, `sb` remains unchanged.**
