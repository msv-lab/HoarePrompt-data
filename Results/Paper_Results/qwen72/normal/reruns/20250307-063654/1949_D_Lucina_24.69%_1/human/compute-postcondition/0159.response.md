To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `j` and `n`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `xx` remains unchanged.
- `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- `sb` remains unchanged.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is a string containing the element at index `[i][j - 1]` of `xx`.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `nx` is 'F'.
- Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `j` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 2, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is a string containing the element at index `[i][j - 1]` of `xx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
