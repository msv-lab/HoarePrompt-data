The value of `i` which is 1 is appended to the list `sa`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a[1]`, and `b[1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, and `sa` now contains the value 1.
Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `a[1]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, and `sa` contains [1].**
