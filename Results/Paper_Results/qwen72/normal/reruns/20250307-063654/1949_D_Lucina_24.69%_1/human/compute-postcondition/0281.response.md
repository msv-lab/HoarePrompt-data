Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is the character at the position `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to the previous value of `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is either the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` if it is not '?', or 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, or 'F' if `i` and `j` are not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.***
