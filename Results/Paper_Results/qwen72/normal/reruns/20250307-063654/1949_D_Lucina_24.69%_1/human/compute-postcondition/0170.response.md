Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 3, `j` is 3, `i` is 2, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `nx` remains unchanged. If `xx[2][2]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[2][2]`. If `xx[2][2]` is equal to '?', and if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), `nx` is a string with an additional 'F' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the string 'S'.***
