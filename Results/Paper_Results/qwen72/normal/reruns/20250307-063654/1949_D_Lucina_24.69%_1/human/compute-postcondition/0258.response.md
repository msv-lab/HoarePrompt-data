The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. However, the initial state does not specify the initial value of `nx`, so we can only state that `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to its current value. The values of `n`, `j`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `i` is `i + 1`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'.**
