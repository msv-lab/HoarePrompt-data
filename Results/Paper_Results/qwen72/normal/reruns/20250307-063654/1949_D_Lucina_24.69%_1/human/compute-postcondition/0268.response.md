Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `nx` is the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx`, and the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` is not '?'**

Explanation: The code appends the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` to the string `nx`. Since `i` is `i + 2`, the character at the position `i - 1` (which is `i + 1 - 1` or `i`) is appended to `nx`. The other variables (`n`, `j`) remain unchanged, and the condition that the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` is not '?' still holds true.
