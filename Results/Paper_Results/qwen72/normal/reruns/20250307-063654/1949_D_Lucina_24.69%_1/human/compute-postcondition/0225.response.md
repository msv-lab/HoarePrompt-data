Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `nx` is updated to `nx` + `xx[i][1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.
- The value of `j` remains 2.
- The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value at `xx[i][1]` to it. Since `j` is 2, `j - 1` equals 1, so the value at `xx[i][1]` is added to `nx`.
