Postcondition: **`n` remains the same as the initial input, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings provided during the loop execution. `sa` is a list containing all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. Additionally, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.**
