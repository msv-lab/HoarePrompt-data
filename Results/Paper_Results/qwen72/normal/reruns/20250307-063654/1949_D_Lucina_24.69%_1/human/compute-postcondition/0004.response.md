The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 1 to ensure the loop condition `range(1, n + 1)` is met for the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
