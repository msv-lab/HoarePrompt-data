Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains the same as the initial input, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings provided during the loop execution, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)
    if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings provided during the loop execution, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions described. If `b[1]` is greater than 0 and `a[1]` is 0, `sa` remains an empty list, and `sb` is now a list containing the element 1. Otherwise, `sa` is a list containing `[1]` if `a[1]` is greater than 0 and `b[1]` is 0; otherwise, `sa` remains an empty list, and `sb` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings provided during the loop execution. If `b[2]` is greater than 0 and `a[2]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing `[2]`. Otherwise, `sa` remains an empty list, and `sb` remains as it was.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings provided during the loop execution. If `b[3] > 0` and `a[3] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing `[3]` and `sa` remains as it was. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain as they were.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
