Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation:
- The variable `nx` is initialized to an empty string, so its value is now `''`.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `j` remains `n + 1`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The condition for determining the characters in `nx` and the list `sb` are not affected by this code snippet.
