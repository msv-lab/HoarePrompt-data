The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a` at the index `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is `n + 1`, so the value of `a` at index `n + 1` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged at all other indices, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input string, and the value of `a` at index `n + 1` is increased by 1.**
