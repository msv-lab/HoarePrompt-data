Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged at all other indices, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input string. If the character at index 2 of `x` (i.e., `x[j - 1]`) is 'F', the value of `a` at index `n + 1` and index 3 is incremented by 1, and `b` remains unchanged. If the character at index 2 of `x` is 'S', the value of `b` at index `n + 1` and index 3 is incremented by 1, and `a` remains unchanged. If the character at index 2 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
