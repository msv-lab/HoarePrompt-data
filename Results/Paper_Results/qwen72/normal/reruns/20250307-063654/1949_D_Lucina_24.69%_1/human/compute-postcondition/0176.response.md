Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 1, `i` is 3, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `nx` is an empty string, and the element at index `i` of `xx` (i.e., `xx[3]`) does not have a '?' character at index `j - 1` (i.e., `xx[3][0]` is not '?').**
