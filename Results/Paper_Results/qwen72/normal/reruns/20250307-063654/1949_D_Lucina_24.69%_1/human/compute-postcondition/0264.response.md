The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `j` is `n + 1`
- `i` is `i + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 2`
- `n` must still be greater than 0, and `i` must be less than or equal to `n`

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 2`, and `nx` is constructed as described in the task**
