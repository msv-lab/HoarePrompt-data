Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `nx` is updated to `nx` + `xx[i][2]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the variable `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][2]` to it. Since `j` is 3, `j - 1` equals 2, so `xx[i][2]` is added to `nx`. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged. The initial condition that `n` is greater than or equal to 3 is still valid. The specific value of `xx[i][2]` is not provided, but it is added to `nx`.
