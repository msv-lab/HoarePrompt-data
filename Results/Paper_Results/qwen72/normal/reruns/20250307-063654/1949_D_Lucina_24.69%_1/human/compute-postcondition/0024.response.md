The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is 1, `a[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `a[1]` is incremented by 1, `a[2]` remains unchanged, `b[1]` remains unchanged, `b[2]` remains unchanged.**
