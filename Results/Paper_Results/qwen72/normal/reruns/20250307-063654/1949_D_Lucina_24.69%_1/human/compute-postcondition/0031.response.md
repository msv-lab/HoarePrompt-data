Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, for each index `k` from 0 to `n-1` in `x`, if the character at index `k` is 'F', both `a[1]` and `a[k+1]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `k` is 'S', both `b[1]` and `b[k+1]` are incremented by 1. The values of `a` and `b` at all other indices remain unchanged. `xx` is a list that now includes the input string `x`.**
