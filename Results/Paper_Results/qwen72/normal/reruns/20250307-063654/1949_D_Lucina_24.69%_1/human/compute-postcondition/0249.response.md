Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `i` is `i + 1`. If the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` is not '?', `nx` is the string containing the character at the position `i - 1` in `xx`. If the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` is '?', `nx` is 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb` (i.e., in the sublist `sb[:n // 4]`), otherwise `nx` is 'F'.***
