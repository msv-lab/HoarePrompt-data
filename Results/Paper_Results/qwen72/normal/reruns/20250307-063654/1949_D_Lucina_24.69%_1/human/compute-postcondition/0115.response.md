Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `sa` contains [1, 2, 2].** 

The value of `i` (which is 2) is appended to the list `sa`. The initial state specifies that if `a[2]` is 0 and `b[2]` is 0, `sa` contains [1, 2]. After appending `i`, `sa` now contains [1, 2, 2]. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
