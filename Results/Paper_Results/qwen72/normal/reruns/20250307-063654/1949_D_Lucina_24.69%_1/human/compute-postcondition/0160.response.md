Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 2, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `nx` is a string containing the element at index `[i][j - 1]` of `xx` appended to its previous value.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 2, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` remains unchanged.
- The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the element at index `[i][j - 1]` of `xx` to the string `nx`.
- Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, `xx[i][j - 1]` refers to `xx[2][1]`.
- If `xx[2][1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` will be the previous value of `nx` plus the value at `xx[2][1]`.
- If `xx[2][1]` is equal to '?', and `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `nx` will be the previous value of `nx` plus 'F'.
- Otherwise, `nx` will be the previous value of `nx` plus 'S'.
- The values of `n`, `j`, `i`, `xx`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged.
