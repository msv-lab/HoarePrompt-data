Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged at all other indices, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input string, the character at index `j - 1` of `x` is 'S', `b[1]` is increased by 1, `b[n + 1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` of the list `b` by 1.
- Since `j` is 1, `b[1]` is incremented by 1.
- The other conditions and variables remain unchanged:
  - `n` is still greater than 1.
  - `j` is still 1.
  - `xx` is still a list that includes the list `x`.
  - `a` and `b` remain unchanged at all other indices.
  - `i` is still `n + 1`.
  - `x` is still an input string.
  - The character at index `j - 1` of `x` is still 'S'.
  - `b[n + 1]` is still increased by 1.
