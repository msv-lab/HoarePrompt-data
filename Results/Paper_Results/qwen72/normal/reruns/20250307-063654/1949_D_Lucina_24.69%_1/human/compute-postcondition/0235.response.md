Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, and `nx` is updated. If `xx[i][2]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx` + `xx[i][2]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`, `nx` is updated to `nx` + 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to `nx` + 'F'.***
