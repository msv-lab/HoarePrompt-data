Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `i` is `i + 1`. If the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` is not '?', `nx` is updated to include the character at the position `i - 1` in `xx` followed by the character at the position `j - 1` in the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` is '?', `nx` is updated to 'S' or 'F' followed by the character at the position `j - 1` in the string at index `i` in `xx`, depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`. If the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` is '?', `nx` is 'SS' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, otherwise `nx` is 'FF'.***
