Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, and for each index `k` from 0 to `n-1` in `x`, if the character at index `k` is 'F', both `a[1]` and `a[k+1]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `k` is 'S', both `b[1]` and `b[k+1]` are incremented by 1. The values of `a` and `b` at all other indices remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` is still greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 1.
- The input string `x` is unchanged.
- For each character in the string `x`:
  - If the character is 'F', the values at `a[1]` and `a[j]` (where `j` is the current index + 1) are each incremented by 1.
  - If the character is 'S', the values at `b[1]` and `b[j]` (where `j` is the current index + 1) are each incremented by 1.
- All other elements in the arrays `a` and `b` that are not affected by the loop remain unchanged.
