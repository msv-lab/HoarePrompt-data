Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `sb` is a list that now contains the element 1 and the element 2.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `sb`. Initially, `sb` contains the element 1, so after the code is executed, `sb` will contain both 1 and 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
