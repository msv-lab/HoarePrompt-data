Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `nx` is the string containing the character at the position `i - 1` in `xx` followed by 'S' if the character at the position `i - 1` in `xx` is not '?', otherwise `nx` is 'SS' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, otherwise `nx` is 'FS'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to it.
- If the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` is not '?', `nx` originally contains that character, and now it contains that character followed by 'S'.
- If the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` is '?', `nx` is either 'S' or 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`. After appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'SS' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, otherwise it becomes 'FS'.
- The values of `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.
