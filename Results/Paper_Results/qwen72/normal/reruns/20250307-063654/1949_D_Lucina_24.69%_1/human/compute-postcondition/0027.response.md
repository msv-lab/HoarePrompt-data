Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `b[1]` is incremented by 1, `b[3]` is incremented by 1.**

The value of `b[3]` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state information that `b[1]` is incremented by 1 is still valid, and now `b[3]` is also incremented by 1.
