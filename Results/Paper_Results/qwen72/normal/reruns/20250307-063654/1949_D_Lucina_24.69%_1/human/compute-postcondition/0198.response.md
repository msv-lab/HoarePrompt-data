Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `i` is 3.
- `xx` remains unchanged (we don't know the exact value of `xx`, but it is a 2D structure or list of lists).
- `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
- `sb` remains unchanged (we don't know the exact value of `sb`).
- `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop:
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the character is `xx[i][j - 1]`.
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, the character is 'F'.
  - Otherwise, the character is 'S'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nx)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the length of `nx`**:
   - `nx` is a string of length `n`.

2. **Determine the value of each character in `nx`**:
   - The value of each character in `nx` is determined by the conditions in the loop:
     - `i` is 3.
     - `j` is `n + 1`.
     - `xx[i][j - 1]` is checked for each `i` from 1 to `n`.

3. **Evaluate the conditions for each character in `nx`**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`:
     - If `xx[i][n]` (since `j - 1` is `n`) is not '?', the character is `xx[i][n]`.
     - If `xx[i][n]` is '?' and `i` or `n` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, the character is 'F'.
     - Otherwise, the character is 'S'.

4. **Understanding `sa`**:
   - `sa` contains indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
   - The first `n // 4` elements of `sa` are the first quarter of the indices in `sa`.

5. **Constructing `nx`**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, the character in `nx` at position `i-1` (since Python lists are 0-indexed) is determined by the conditions:
     - If `xx[i][n]` is not '?', the character is `xx[i][n]`.
     - If `xx[i][n]` is '?' and `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, the character is 'F'.
     - If `xx[i][n]` is '?' and `n` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, the character is 'F'.
     - Otherwise, the character is 'S'.

### Final Output:
Since we don't have the exact values of `xx` and `sa`, we can only describe the output in terms of the conditions given:

- `nx` will be a string of length `n`.
- Each character in `nx` will be:
  - `xx[i][n]` if `xx[i][n]` is not '?'.
  - 'F' if `xx[i][n]` is '?' and `i` or `n` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.
  - 'S' otherwise.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string of length n, and each character is determined by the conditions: if xx[i][n] is not '?', the character is xx[i][n]; if xx[i][n] is '?' and i or n is in the first n // 4 elements of sa, the character is 'F'; otherwise, the character is 'S')**
