The value of `nx` is updated by appending the character 'S' to it. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, the element at `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`. `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'S'.**
