Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 1, `i` is 3, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `nx` is the string 'F', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. Additionally, either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.**
