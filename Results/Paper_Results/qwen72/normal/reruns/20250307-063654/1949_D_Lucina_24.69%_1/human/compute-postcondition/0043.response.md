Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'F', the element at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. If the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'S', the element at index 1 of the list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the element at index 1 of the list `b` remains unchanged.***
