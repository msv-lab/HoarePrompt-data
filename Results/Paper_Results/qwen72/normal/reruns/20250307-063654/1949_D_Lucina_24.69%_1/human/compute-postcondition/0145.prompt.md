Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `j` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` is the string containing the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, if `i` and `j` are not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` is the string containing the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]` appended to the previous value of `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), `nx` is 'F' appended to the previous value of `nx`. Otherwise, if `i` and `j` are not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, `nx` is 'S' appended to the previous value of `nx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `j` is 3, and `nx` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration with the character at `xx[1][2]` appended if `xx[1][2]` is not '?'. If `xx[1][2]` is '?', `nx` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration with 'F' appended if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, otherwise `nx` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration with 'S' appended.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
