Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type are played consecutively for every permutation of scenarios. The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters is flawed. Specifically, the program only considers the first \(n // 4\) elements of the `sa` or `sb` lists to assign 'F' or 'S', which may not be sufficient to prevent long sequences of the same type of transition video.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
.?...
?....
...?.
.....
.....
```
The program will output:
```
.F...
F....
...F.
.....
.....
```
However, if the player plays the scenarios in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the transition videos will be 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', which is 4 consecutive 'F' videos. Since \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 5}{4} \rceil = 4\), this is allowed. However, the program does not guarantee that for all possible permutations, the sequence will not exceed this limit. For instance, if the player plays the scenarios in the order 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, the transition videos will be 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', which again is 4 consecutive 'F' videos. This is a specific case where the program fails to meet the requirement for all permutations.
