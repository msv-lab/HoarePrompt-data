Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings provided during the loop execution. If `a[3]` > 0 and `b[3]` == 0, `sa` is a list containing `[3]`, and `sb` remains as it was. Otherwise, `sa` remains an empty list, and `sb` remains as it was.***
