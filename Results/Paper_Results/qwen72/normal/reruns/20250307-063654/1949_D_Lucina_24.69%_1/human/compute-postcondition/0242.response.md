The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` concatenates the character at the position `i` in the string `xx` (specifically the character at index `j - 1` of the substring `xx[i]`) to the string `nx`. Given that `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0, so the character at the first position (index 0) of the substring `xx[i]` is added to `nx`.

Since `i` is `i + 1` and the character at the position `i` in the string `xx` is not '?', the value of `i` has already been incremented before this line of code is executed. Therefore, the character being added to `nx` is the character at the position `i - 1` in `xx`.

The initial state specifies that `nx` is an empty string, so after the execution, `nx` will contain the character at the position `i - 1` in `xx`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `nx` is the string containing the character at the position `i - 1` in `xx`, `i` is `i + 1`, and the character at the position `i` in the string `xx` is not '?'**
