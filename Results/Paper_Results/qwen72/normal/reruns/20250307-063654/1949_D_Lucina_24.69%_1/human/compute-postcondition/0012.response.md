Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', and the character at index 0 of `x` is not 'F', `b[1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value at index `1` of the list `b` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, so `b[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
