The code `xx.append(x)` adds the input string `x` to the list `xx`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x` and the input string `x`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged at all other indices, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input string.**
