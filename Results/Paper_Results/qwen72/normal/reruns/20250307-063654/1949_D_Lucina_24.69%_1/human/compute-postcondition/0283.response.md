Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `i` is `i + 2`, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` plus the character at `xx[i][2]` if `xx[i][2]` is not '?'. If `xx[i][2]` is '?', `nx` is the previous value of `nx` plus the character at `xx[i - 1][2]` if it is not '?', or 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, or 'F' if `i` and `j` are not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.**
