The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value at the position `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `j` is 3
- `i` is `i + 1`

The value of `j - 1` is 2. Therefore, the value at `xx[i][2]` is added to `nx`. The specific value of `xx[i][2]` is not provided, so we can only say that `nx` is updated by adding this value to its current value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `i` is `i + 1`, `nx` is updated by adding `xx[i][2]` to its current value.**
