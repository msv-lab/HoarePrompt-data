The objects in the loop head are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `j` will start from 1 and go up to `n`. However, the initial state indicates that `j` is `n + 1`, which would not allow the loop to execute since `j` starts outside the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`.

To ensure the loop can execute, `j` must be set to 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `nx` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`**
