The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, and `x` is an input string. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', `a[1]` and `a[2]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', `b[1]` and `b[2]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
