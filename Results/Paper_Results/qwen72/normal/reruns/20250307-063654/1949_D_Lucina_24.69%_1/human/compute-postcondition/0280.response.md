Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, `nx` is either the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` if it is not '?', or 'S' if the character at the position `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'. Otherwise, `nx` is either the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` if it is not '?', or 'F' if the character at the position `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'.***
