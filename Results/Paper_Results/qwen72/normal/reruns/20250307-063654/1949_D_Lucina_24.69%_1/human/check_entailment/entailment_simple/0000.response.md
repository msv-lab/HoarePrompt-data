Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of assigning transition videos (either funny 'F' or scary 'S') between scenarios in a video game, ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown, regardless of the order in which the scenarios are played. The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. Let's break down the logic to evaluate its correctness:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) strings, each of length \( n \). The strings represent the partial transition video plan.
   - It initializes two lists, `a` and `b`, to keep track of the number of funny and scary videos associated with each scenario, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings, with an empty string at the beginning to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting Existing Transitions:**
   - The program iterates through each input string and updates `a` and `b` based on the characters 'F' and 'S'. This ensures that the counts of funny and scary videos for each scenario are correctly maintained.

3. **Identifying Unassigned Scenarios:**
   - The program then identifies scenarios that have only funny videos (`sa`) and scenarios that have only scary videos (`sb`).

4. **Assigning Remaining Transitions:**
   - If the number of scenarios with only funny videos (`sa`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only scary videos (`sb`), the program assigns the remaining transitions as follows:
     - For scenarios that have not been assigned any videos (`a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`), it adds them to `sa`.
     - For each pair of scenarios, if the transition is undecided (`?`), it assigns 'F' if either scenario is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), and 'S' otherwise.
   - If the number of scenarios with only scary videos (`sb`) is greater, the program follows a similar logic but assigns 'S' if either scenario is in the first quarter of `sb` (i.e., `sb[:n // 4]`), and 'F' otherwise.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final transition video plan, which is a list of \( n \) strings, each of length \( n \), with the characters 'F', 'S', or '.' as required.

### Evaluation of Correctness:

- **Input and Output Format:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and outputs the transition video plan in the required format.

- **Symmetry and Pre-existing Assignments:**
  - The program maintains the symmetry of the transition videos (i.e., the transition video from scenario \( i \) to scenario \( j \) is the same as from \( j \) to \( i \)).
  - It respects the pre-existing assignments of 'F' and 'S' in the input.

- **Consecutive Videos Constraint:**
  - The program ensures that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown by strategically assigning 'F' and 'S' to the undecided transitions.
  - By assigning 'F' to the first quarter of `sa` and 'S' to the rest, or vice versa for `sb`, it attempts to balance the number of consecutive videos of the same type.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where \( n \) is small (e.g., \( n = 2 \)) and ensures that the constraints are met.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and requirements. It maintains symmetry, respects pre-existing assignments, and ensures that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
