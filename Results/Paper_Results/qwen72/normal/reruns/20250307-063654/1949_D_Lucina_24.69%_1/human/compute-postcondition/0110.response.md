The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. The variable `i` should start at 1 for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
