Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, and `x` is an input string. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', `a[1]` and `a[2]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', `b[1]` and `b[2]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
