### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the `n` strings of length `n` representing the partial transition video plan.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input matrix.

2. **Counting Known Transitions:**
   - The program iterates through the input matrix and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each known transition (either 'F' or 'S').
   - This step ensures that the program has a clear understanding of the known transitions for each scenario.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - This step helps in identifying scenarios that are already biased towards one type of transition.

4. **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
   - The program then decides how to assign the undecided transitions ('?') based on the sizes of `sa` and `sb`.
   - If `sa` (scenarios with only funny transitions) is larger or equal to `sb` (scenarios with only scary transitions), it adds scenarios with no known transitions to `sa`.
   - For each scenario, it keeps the known transitions unchanged and assigns 'F' to the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` and 'S' to the rest.
   - Conversely, if `sb` is larger, it adds scenarios with no known transitions to `sb` and assigns 'S' to the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` and 'F' to the rest.

5. **Output the Full Transition Plan:**
   - The program prints the full transition plan, ensuring that the symmetry property (i.e., `xx[i][j] == xx[j][i]`) is maintained.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry Property:**
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix is symmetric by reading the input matrix and maintaining the same values for `xx[i][j]` and `xx[j][i]`.

- **Handling Known Transitions:**
  - The program correctly counts and keeps track of known transitions (both 'F' and 'S') for each scenario.

- **Assigning Undecided Transitions:**
  - The program's strategy for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions is based on the sizes of `sa` and `sb` and the first `n // 4` elements of these lists.
  - This strategy aims to balance the number of consecutive funny or scary transitions, but it does not explicitly check all permutations of scenarios to ensure that no permutation results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.
  - The logic for assigning transitions is not robust enough to guarantee the required constraint is met for all possible permutations.

- **Permutation Constraint:**
  - The program does not explicitly check all permutations of scenarios to ensure that no permutation results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.
  - This is a critical part of the problem that the program fails to address.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios is satisfied. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
