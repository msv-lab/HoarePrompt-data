Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings provided during the loop execution. If `b[3] > 0` and `a[3] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing `[3]` and `sa` remains as it was. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain as they were.***
