Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 2, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is a string containing the element at index `[i][j - 1]` of `xx` followed by 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
