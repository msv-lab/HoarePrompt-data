Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, from the user. This matches the problem description.

2. **Matrix Processing**: The program processes the symmetric matrix by counting the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each row and column. This is done using the arrays `a` and `b`, where `a[i]` counts the number of 'F' transitions involving scenario `i`, and `b[i]` counts the number of 'S' transitions involving scenario `i`.

3. **Identifying Undecided Scenarios**: The program identifies scenarios that have only 'F' transitions (`sa` list) and scenarios that have only 'S' transitions (`sb` list). This is a good approach to categorize the scenarios based on their current transition types.

4. **Updating the Matrix**:
   - If the list of scenarios with 'F' transitions (`sa`) is larger or equal to the list of scenarios with 'S' transitions (`sb`), the program updates the matrix by replacing '?' with 'F' for the first quarter of these scenarios and with 'S' otherwise.
   - If the list of scenarios with 'S' transitions (`sb`) is larger, the program updates the matrix by replacing '?' with 'S' for the first quarter of these scenarios and with 'F' otherwise.

5. **Output**: The program prints the updated matrix, which should now have all '?' characters replaced with either 'F' or 'S' while maintaining the symmetry of the matrix.

6. **Constraint Satisfaction**: The program ensures that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type are present in any permutation of scenarios. This is achieved by distributing the 'F' and 'S' transitions in a balanced manner, especially by ensuring that the first quarter of the scenarios with more 'F' or 'S' transitions are assigned the opposite type to balance the sequence.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 2 or 24, and the constraints on the number of pre-decided transitions are respected.
   - The program ensures that the matrix remains symmetric and that the diagonal elements remain '.'.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle the input, process the matrix, and update it to meet the problem's requirements. The logic for distributing 'F' and 'S' transitions to avoid more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type is sound.

Correctness: **True**
