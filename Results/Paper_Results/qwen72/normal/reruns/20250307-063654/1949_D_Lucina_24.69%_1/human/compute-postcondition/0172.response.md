Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than 1.
2. `j` is set to `n`.
3. `i` is set to 2.
4. `xx` remains unchanged (we don't know its exact content, but it is a list or array of some kind).
5. `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
6. `sb` remains unchanged (we don't know its exact content, but it is a list or array of some kind).
7. `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined as follows:
   - If `xx[2][j - 1]` is not '?', the character is the corresponding character from `xx[2][j - 1]`.
   - If `xx[2][j - 1]` is '?', the character is 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.
   - If `xx[2][j - 1]` is '?' and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, the character is 'S'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nx)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `j` and `i`**:
   - `j` is set to `n`.
   - `i` is set to 2.

2. **Determine the first quarter of `sa`**:
   - The first quarter of `sa` would be the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.

3. **Construct the string `nx`**:
   - `nx` is a string of length `n`.
   - For each character in `nx` at position `k` (where `k` ranges from 0 to `n-1`):
     - If `xx[2][k]` is not '?', the character in `nx` at position `k` is `xx[2][k]`.
     - If `xx[2][k]` is '?':
       - Check if `i` (which is 2) or `j` (which is `n`) is in the first quarter of `sa`.
       - If either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, the character in `nx` at position `k` is 'F'.
       - If neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, the character in `nx` at position `k` is 'S'.

### Output:
Since we don't have the exact values of `xx` and `sa`, we can only describe the output based on the given conditions.

- If `xx[2][k]` is not '?', the character in `nx` at position `k` will be the corresponding character from `xx[2][k]`.
- If `xx[2][k]` is '?':
  - If `i` (2) or `j` (n) is in the first quarter of `sa`, the character in `nx` at position `k` will be 'F'.
  - If neither `i` (2) nor `j` (n) is in the first quarter of `sa`, the character in `nx` at position `k` will be 'S'.

Therefore, the output will be a string `nx` of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions described above.

Output: **nx (where each character in nx is determined by the conditions: if xx[2][k] is not '?', it is the corresponding character from xx[2][k]; if xx[2][k] is '?', it is 'F' if i (2) or j (n) is in the first quarter of sa, otherwise it is 'S')**
