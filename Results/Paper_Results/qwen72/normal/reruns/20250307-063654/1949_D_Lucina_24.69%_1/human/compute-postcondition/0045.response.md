The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the element at index `i` of the list `a` by 1. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of the list `a` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, the element at index 0 of the list `x` is either 'F', 'S', or something else, the element at index 1 of the list `a` is incremented by 1 if the element at index 0 of `x` is 'F', otherwise the element at index 1 of `b` is incremented by 1 if the element at index 0 of `x` is 'S', and the element at index 1 of `b` remains unchanged otherwise. The element at index 2 of the list `a` is incremented by 1.**
