Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains the same as the initial input, `i` is `n + 1`, and `sb` is a list that contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. The lists `sa` and `xx` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined as follows: If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', the character is `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`, the character is 'S'. Otherwise, the character is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`. The string `nx` is constructed by iterating through the first `n` characters of the string at index `i` in `xx`. For each character in this string, if it is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If it is '?', 'S' is appended to `nx` if either `i` or the current index `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb` (i.e., in the sublist `sb[:n // 4]`), otherwise 'F' is appended to `nx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 2`, and `nx` is a string that contains characters from `xx[i]` at positions 0 to `n - 1`, where each character is either the original character if it is not '?', 'S' if the position or `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` and the character is '?', or 'F' if the character is '?' and the position and `i` are not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
