Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings provided during the loop execution. If `a[2]` is greater than 0 and `b[2]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing `[2]`, and `sb` remains as it was. Otherwise, `sa` remains an empty list, and `sb` remains as it was.***
