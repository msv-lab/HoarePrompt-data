Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `a[1]` is incremented by 1, `a[2]` is incremented by 1.**

The value of `a[2]` is incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `j`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The initial state specified that `a[1]` was already incremented by 1, and now `a[2]` has also been incremented by 1.
