The only objects in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, and `i` is `i + 1`**
