The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 1, and `i` is 3. Since `j` is 1, the next iteration will increment `j` by 1, making `j` equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, `i` is 3, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the first character of `xx[3]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is the string 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, otherwise `nx` is the string 'S'.**
