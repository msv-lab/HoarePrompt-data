Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', and the character at index 0 of `x` is not 'F', `b[1]` is incremented by 1.**

The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value at index 1 of the list `b` by 1. Since `j` is 1, the value `b[1]` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
