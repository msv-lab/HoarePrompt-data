You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input is a list of n strings, each of length n, containing characters 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j, and at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.
def func():
    n = int(input())

    b = [0] * (n + 1)

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial input. The list `xx` contains `n + 1` elements, where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings provided during the loop execution. The lists `a` and `b` are updated such that for each input string `x` at iteration `i`, if the character at index `k` in `x` is 'F', both `a[i]` and `a[k+1]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `k` in `x` is 'S', both `b[i]` and `b[k+1]` are incremented by 1. All other indices in `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

        #State: `n` remains the same, `i` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` for each iteration of `i` from 1 to `n`, where each character in `nx` is determined as follows: If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', the character is `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`, the character is 'S'. Otherwise, the character is 'F'.
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` remains the same as the initial input, `xx` contains `n + 1` elements where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the input strings provided during the loop execution. `i` is `n + 1`. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, and `nx` is a string of length `n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the character is the one at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), the character is 'F'; otherwise, the character is 'S'. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, `nx` is a string of length `n` for each iteration of `i` from 1 to `n`, where each character in `nx` is determined as follows: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', the character is `xx[i][j - 1]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`, the character is 'S'; otherwise, the character is 'F'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a symmetric matrix of size n x n, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, and each element is one of 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. It returns a value based on the properties of the matrix, particularly the distribution and placement of 'F' and 'S' characters, ensuring that at most 2 * floor(n / 2) of these characters are present.
