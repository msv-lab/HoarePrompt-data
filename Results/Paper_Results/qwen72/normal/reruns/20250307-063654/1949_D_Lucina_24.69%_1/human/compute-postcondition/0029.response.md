Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, and `x` is an input string. If the character at index 2 of `x` is 'F', `a[1]` and `a[3]` are incremented by 1, while `b[1]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged. If the character at index 2 of `x` is 'S', `b[1]` and `b[3]` are incremented by 1, while `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
