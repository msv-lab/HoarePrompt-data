Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `i` is 3, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is a string containing the first character of `xx[3]` plus 'SF' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or `nx` is a string containing the first character of `xx[3]` plus 'SS' if `i` or `j` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is 'FFF' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, or `nx` is 'FFS' if `i` or `j` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`.**
