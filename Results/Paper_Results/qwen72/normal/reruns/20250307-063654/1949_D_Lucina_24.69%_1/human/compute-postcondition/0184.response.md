Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 1, `i` is 3, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the first character of `xx[3]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is the string 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, otherwise `nx` is the string 'S'.***
