Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, `a[1]` is incremented by 1, `a[2]` remains unchanged, `a[3]` is incremented by 1, `b[1]` remains unchanged, `b[2]` remains unchanged.**

The value of `a[j]` is incremented by 1, where `j` is 3, so `a[3]` is incremented by 1. The other variables and array elements remain unchanged.
