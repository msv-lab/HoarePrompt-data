Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is `i + 2`, and `nx` is either the character at the position `i - 1` in the string `xx` if it is not '?', or 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` and the character at the position `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', or 'F' if the character at the position `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and `i` and `j` are not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, followed by 'S'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `j` remains 2.
- The value of `i` is still `i + 2`.
- The value of `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to its existing value. The existing value of `nx` is determined based on the conditions provided in the initial state. Therefore, the new value of `nx` is the original value followed by 'S'.
