Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `xx[i][2]` is not '?', `nx` is the previous value of `nx` plus the character at `xx[i][2]`. If `xx[i][2]` is '?', `nx` is the previous value of `nx` plus the character at `xx[i - 1][2]` if it is not '?', or 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, or 'F' if `i` and `j` are not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.***
