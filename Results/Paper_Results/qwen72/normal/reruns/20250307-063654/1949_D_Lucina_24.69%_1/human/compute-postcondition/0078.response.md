Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list that includes the list `x`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged at all other indices, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input string. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'F', the value of `a` at index 2 is increased by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is 'S', the value of `b` at index 2 is increased by 1. If the character at index 0 of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
