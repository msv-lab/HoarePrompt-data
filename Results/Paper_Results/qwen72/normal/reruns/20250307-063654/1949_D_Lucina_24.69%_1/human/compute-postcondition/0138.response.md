Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` is the string containing the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]` appended to the previous value of `nx`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), `nx` is 'F' appended to the previous value of `nx`. Otherwise, if `i` and `j` are not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, `nx` is 'S' appended to the previous value of `nx`.***
