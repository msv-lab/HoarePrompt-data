Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains the same as the initial input, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4] or j in sa[:n // 4]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `j` is `n`, and `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, the character is the one at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?` and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4]`), the character is 'F'; otherwise, the character is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n`, `i` is 2, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is either the corresponding character from `xx[2][j - 1]` if it is not '?', 'F' if `xx[2][j - 1]` is '?' and `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, or 'S' if `xx[2][j - 1]` is '?' and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is 3, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `nx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the conditions in the loop: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the character is `xx[i][j - 1]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?' and `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, the character is 'F'; otherwise, the character is 'S'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
