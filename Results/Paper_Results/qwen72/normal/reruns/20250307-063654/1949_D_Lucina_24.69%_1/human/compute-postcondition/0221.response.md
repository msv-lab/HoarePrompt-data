The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and the conditions regarding `xx[i][j - 1]` and the positions of `i` and `j` in `sb` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, the element at `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `i` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, `j` is not in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, and `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'F'.**
