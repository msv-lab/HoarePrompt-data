The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, and `i` is `i + 2`. The initial state also provides a conditional statement for updating `nx`, but the code snippet directly appends 'S' to `nx` without considering these conditions.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `i` is `i + 2`, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` with 'S' appended to it.**
