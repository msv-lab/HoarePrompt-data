The function `func` accepts no parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function expects an input in the form of a list of n strings, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. Each string in the list is of length n and contains characters 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The input list forms a symmetric matrix, meaning the character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j. Additionally, at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.

The function returns a value based on the input, but the specific return value is not provided in the constraints. Given the context, we can infer that the function likely processes the input to determine some property or condition related to the characters 'F' and 'S' in the symmetric matrix.

Functionality: **The function processes a symmetric matrix of size n x n, where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, and each element is one of 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. It returns a value based on the properties of the matrix, particularly the distribution and placement of 'F' and 'S' characters, ensuring that at most 2 * floor(n / 2) of these characters are present.**
