Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `nx` is 'S', the character at the position `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and either `i` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.**

The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, it now contains the character 'S'. The values of `n`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition about the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` and the positions of `i` and `j` in `sb` also remain valid.
