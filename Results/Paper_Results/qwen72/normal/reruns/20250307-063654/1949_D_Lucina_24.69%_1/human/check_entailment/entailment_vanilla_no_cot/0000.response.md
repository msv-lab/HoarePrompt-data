Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not fully address the problem requirements. While it attempts to distribute the undecided transitions between funny (F) and scary (S) videos, it does not ensure that no permutation of scenarios will have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. The logic for assigning the undecided transitions is flawed, and it does not guarantee that the solution will meet the requirement for all possible permutations of the scenarios.

Here are some specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Distribution of Undecided Transitions**: The program assigns 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions based on the first \(n/4\) elements of `sa` or `sb`. This approach does not ensure that the transitions are distributed in a way that avoids more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for all permutations.

2. **Handling of Symmetry**: The input matrix is symmetric, meaning that if the transition from scenario \(i\) to scenario \(j\) is funny, the transition from scenario \(j\) to scenario \(i\) must also be funny. The program does not explicitly handle this symmetry in its logic, which could lead to inconsistencies.

3. **No Validation of the Solution**: The program does not validate whether the final transition plan meets the requirement of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of the scenarios.

To ensure the correctness of the solution, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a backtracking algorithm to try different assignments of 'F' and 'S' to the undecided transitions and checking if the resulting plan meets the requirement for all permutations. Alternatively, a greedy algorithm with careful consideration of the constraints could be used.

Here is a more detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

- **Example 1**: For \(n = 5\), the program might output a plan where all transitions are 'F'. This would not satisfy the requirement for some permutations, such as playing scenarios in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, which would result in 4 consecutive 'F' transitions.
- **Example 2**: For \(n = 12\), the program might not distribute the 'F' and 'S' transitions evenly enough to avoid having more than 9 consecutive videos of the same type.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem's requirements.
