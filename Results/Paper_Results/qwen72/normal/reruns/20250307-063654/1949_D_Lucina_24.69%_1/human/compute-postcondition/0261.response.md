Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `xx[i][2]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated by adding `xx[i][2]` to its current value. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is `nx` plus 'F'.***
