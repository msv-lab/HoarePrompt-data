Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` is `i + 2`, and `nx` is the character at the position `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to the previous value of `nx`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `j` remains 2.
- The value of `i` is `i + 2`.
- The value of `nx` is updated by appending the character at the position `xx[i][j - 1]` to its previous value. The previous value of `nx` could be a character from the string `xx` at position `i - 1` or 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions provided in the initial state. The new value of `nx` is the concatenation of its previous value and the character at `xx[i][j - 1]`.
