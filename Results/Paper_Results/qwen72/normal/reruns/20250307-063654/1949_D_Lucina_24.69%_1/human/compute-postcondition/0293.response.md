Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, from the user. It processes this symmetric matrix, counting the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each row and column. The function then identifies indices where only 'F' or 'S' are present and appends indices with no 'F' or 'S' to the appropriate list. Based on the size of these lists, it updates the matrix by replacing '?' characters: if the list of 'F' indices is larger or equal, it replaces '?' with 'F' for the first quarter of these indices and with 'S' otherwise; if the list of 'S' indices is larger, it replaces '?' with 'S' for the first quarter of these indices and with 'F' otherwise. The function prints the updated matrix. The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, the original input matrix `xx` is unchanged, and the updated matrix is printed. **
