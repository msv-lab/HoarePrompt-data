Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3, `i` is `i + 2`, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` plus 'F'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains greater than or equal to 3.
- The value of `j` remains 3.
- The value of `i` remains `i + 2`.
- The value of `nx` is updated by appending 'F' to its previous value. Therefore, `nx` is now the previous value of `nx` plus 'F'.
