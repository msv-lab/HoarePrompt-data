### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the integer `n` which represents the number of scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It reads the input matrix `xx` which represents the partial transition video plan.

2. **Counting Known Transitions:**
   - The program iterates through the input matrix and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each known transition (either 'F' or 'S').

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.

4. **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
   - If the number of scenarios with only funny transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only scary transitions (`sb`), the program will:
     - Add scenarios with no known transitions to `sa`.
     - For each scenario, it will:
       - Keep the known transitions unchanged.
       - Assign 'F' to the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` and 'S' to the rest.
   - Otherwise, it will:
     - Add scenarios with no known transitions to `sb`.
     - For each scenario, it will:
       - Keep the known transitions unchanged.
       - Assign 'S' to the first `n // 4` elements of `sb` and 'F' to the rest.

5. **Output the Full Transition Plan:**
   - The program prints the full transition plan, ensuring that the symmetry property (i.e., `xx[i][j] == xx[j][i]`) is maintained.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry Property:**
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix is symmetric by reading the input matrix and maintaining the same values for `xx[i][j]` and `xx[j][i]`.

- **Handling Known Transitions:**
  - The program correctly counts and keeps track of known transitions (both 'F' and 'S') for each scenario.

- **Assigning Undecided Transitions:**
  - The program assigns 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions in a way that tries to balance the number of consecutive funny or scary transitions.
  - However, the logic for assigning transitions to avoid more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type is not robust. The program simply assigns the first `n // 4` elements to one type and the rest to the other type, which may not always ensure the required constraint is met.

- **Permutation Constraint:**
  - The program does not explicitly check all permutations of scenarios to ensure that no permutation results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type. This is a critical part of the problem that the program fails to address.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios is satisfied. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
