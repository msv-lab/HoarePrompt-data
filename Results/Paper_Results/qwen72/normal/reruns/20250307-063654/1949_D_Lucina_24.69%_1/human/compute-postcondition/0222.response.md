Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the element at `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'. If either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of the list `sb`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the character 'F'.***
