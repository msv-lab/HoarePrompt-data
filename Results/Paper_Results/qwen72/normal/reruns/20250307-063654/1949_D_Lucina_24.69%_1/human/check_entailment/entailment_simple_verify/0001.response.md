### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and initializes the lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It reads the input matrix `xx` which represents the partial transition video plan.

2. **Counting Known Transitions:**
   - The program iterates through the input matrix and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each known transition (either 'F' or 'S'). This is done correctly.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively. This is also done correctly.

4. **Handling Undecided Transitions:**
   - The program's logic for handling undecided transitions is flawed. It simply assigns 'F' to the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` and 'S' to the rest, or vice versa for `sb`. This approach does not ensure that the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type is met for any permutation of scenarios.
   - The program's strategy of assigning transitions based on the first quarter of `sa` or `sb` is not sufficient to handle all possible permutations of scenarios. For example, if the first quarter of `sa` has a high concentration of 'F' transitions, and the rest of the scenarios have a high concentration of 'S' transitions, it is possible to still have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.

5. **Output the Full Transition Plan:**
   - The program prints the full transition plan, ensuring that the symmetry property (i.e., `xx[i][j] == xx[j][i]`) is maintained. This part is correct.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry Property:**
  - The program correctly ensures that the transition matrix is symmetric.

- **Handling Known Transitions:**
  - The program correctly counts and keeps track of known transitions (both 'F' and 'S') for each scenario.

- **Assigning Undecided Transitions:**
  - The program's method of assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions is not robust enough to guarantee the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.
  - The program does not explicitly check all permutations of scenarios to ensure that the constraint is met, which is a critical part of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios is satisfied. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
