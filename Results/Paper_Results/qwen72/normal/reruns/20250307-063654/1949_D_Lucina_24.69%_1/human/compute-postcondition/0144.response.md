Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `xx` remains unchanged, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged, `j` is 3, and `nx` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration with the character at `xx[1][2]` appended if `xx[1][2]` is not '?'. If `xx[1][2]` is '?', `nx` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration with 'F' appended if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, otherwise `nx` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration with 'S' appended.***
