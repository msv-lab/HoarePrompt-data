The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `r - l > 1`. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `r - l` must be greater than 1. Given `l` is 0, `r` (which is `n`) must be greater than 1.

Since `n` is the length of `array` and `array` is a permutation of size `n`, `n` must already be a positive integer. However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`**
