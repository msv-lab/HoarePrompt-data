Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to `mid`, which is `n // 2`. The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `mid` remains `n // 2` as it was defined in the initial state.
