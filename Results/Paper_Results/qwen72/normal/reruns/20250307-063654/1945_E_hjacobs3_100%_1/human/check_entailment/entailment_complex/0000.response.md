Reasoning:

The program aims to find the position of a number `x` in a permutation `array` using a binary search approach, but with the ability to perform up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search can find `x` correctly. The binary search is performed in the function `func_1`.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is implemented correctly with `l` and `r` initialized to 0 and `n` respectively.
   - The loop continues until `r - l` is 1, which is the correct termination condition for binary search.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - If `array[mid] <= find`, `l` is updated to `mid`.
   - If `array[mid] > find`, `r` is updated to `mid`.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - After the binary search loop, the program checks if `l` (the largest index such that `array[l] <= find`) is equal to the actual index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, the program prints `1` and returns a list of two strings: the 1-based index of `l` and the 1-based index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, the program prints `0` and returns `None`.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.
   - It calls `func_1` with `array` and `x`, and prints the result if `func_1` returns a non-`None` value.

### Potential Issues:
- **1-based Indexing**:
  - The function `func_1` returns 1-based indices, which is consistent with the problem's requirement.
- **Swapping Only Once**:
  - The function only performs one swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `find`. However, the problem states that up to 2 swaps are allowed. This means the function might not always find a solution if more than one swap is needed, but the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, so this is not an issue in the context of the problem.
- **Binary Search on Unsorted Array**:
  - The binary search is applied to an unsorted permutation, which is not the typical use case for binary search. However, the problem allows up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work, and the function correctly identifies when a swap is needed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies when a swap is needed and performs the swap as required. It also handles multiple test cases and prints the correct output format. Given the problem's constraints and guarantees, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
