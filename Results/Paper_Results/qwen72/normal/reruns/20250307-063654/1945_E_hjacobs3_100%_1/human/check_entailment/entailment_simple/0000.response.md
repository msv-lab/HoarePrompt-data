Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the index of a given number `x` in a permutation `p` using a binary search-like algorithm, but with the possibility of performing up to two swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. The program reads multiple test cases, processes each one, and outputs the necessary swaps to find `x`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Binary Search Initialization**: The binary search initialization is slightly off. The problem description states that `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`, but the program initializes `l = 0` and `r = n`. This discrepancy could lead to incorrect behavior, especially when `x` is the first or last element in the permutation.

2. **Indexing**: The program uses 0-based indexing for the array, but the problem description and the output format suggest 1-based indexing. The function `func_1` returns indices in 1-based format, which is correct, but the binary search logic should be adjusted to match this.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The program only performs one swap if the element `find` is not at the index `l` after the binary search. However, the problem allows for up to two swaps, and the program should ensure that the binary search will find the correct element after these swaps.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the number of swaps directly, but the problem requires the number of swaps to be printed on the first line of the output for each test case, followed by the swap indices on subsequent lines. The current implementation does not follow this format correctly.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Initialization and Indexing**: The binary search should be initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1` to match the problem's 1-based indexing. The current initialization with `l = 0` and `r = n` is incorrect.
- **Swapping Logic**: The program only performs one swap, which may not be sufficient in all cases. The problem guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, so the program should be designed to handle up to two swaps.
- **Output Format**: The program should print the number of swaps on the first line and then the swap indices on subsequent lines. The current implementation prints the number of swaps directly, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the issues with binary search initialization, indexing, and the swapping logic. The program does not handle the problem's requirements correctly, especially the need for up to two swaps and the correct output format.

Correctness: **False**
