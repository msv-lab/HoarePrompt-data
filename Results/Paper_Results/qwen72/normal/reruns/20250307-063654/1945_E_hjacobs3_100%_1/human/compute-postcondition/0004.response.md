Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and the element at the middle index of `array` (i.e., `array[mid]`) is less than or equal to `find`.**
