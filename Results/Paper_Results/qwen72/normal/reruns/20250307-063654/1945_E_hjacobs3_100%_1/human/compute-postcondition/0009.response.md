The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `r - l > 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, and `mid` is `n // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `r - l` must still be greater than 1.

Given the updates:
- If `array[mid]` ≤ `find`, then `l` is updated to `n // 2` and `r` remains `n`.
- Otherwise, `r` is updated to `n // 2` and `l` remains 0.

In both cases, `r - l` will be `n // 2` after the update. To ensure that `r - l > 1`, `n // 2` must be greater than 1. This means `n` must be greater than 2.

Since `n` is already stated to be greater than 1, and the updates will maintain `r - l > 1` as long as `n > 2`, no further adjustments are needed.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, and `mid` is `n // 2`. If `array[mid]` ≤ `find`, then `l` is updated to `n // 2` and `r` remains `n`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `n // 2` and `l` remains 0.**
