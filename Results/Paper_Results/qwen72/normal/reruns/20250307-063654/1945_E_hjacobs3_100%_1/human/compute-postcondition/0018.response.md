Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, and `n` must be greater than 2. If `array[mid]` ≤ `find`, then `l` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`, and `r` remains either `n` or `n // 2`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid`, and `l` remains either 0 or `n // 2`.***
