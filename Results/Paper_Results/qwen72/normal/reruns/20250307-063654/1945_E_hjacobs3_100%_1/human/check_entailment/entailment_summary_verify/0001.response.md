### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the program:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The problem description specifies that `l` should be initialized to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`, but the program initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`. This discrepancy will lead to incorrect behavior of the binary search algorithm because the indices used in the search will be off by one.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop condition `r - l > 1` is correct for a binary search, and the midpoint calculation `mid = (l + r) // 2` is also correct. However, the incorrect initialization of `l` and `r` means that the search will not operate on the correct range of indices.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program only handles the case where a single swap is needed. It prints 1 and returns the indices of the elements to swap if `l` is not the index of `x`. However, the problem requires that the program can handle up to 2 swaps.
   - The function `func_1` does not actually perform the swaps; it only prints the indices and returns them. This is a minor issue since the problem only requires the indices to be output, not the actual swapping.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of operations (0 or 1) and the indices to swap, but it does not handle the case where 2 swaps are needed. This is a significant issue because the problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, and the program must be able to handle this scenario.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly initialize the binary search indices, does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed, and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False**
