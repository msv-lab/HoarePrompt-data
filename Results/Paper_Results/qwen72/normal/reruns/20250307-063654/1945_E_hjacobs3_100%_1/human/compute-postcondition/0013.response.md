Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `n // 2`. If `array[mid]` ≤ `find`, `l` is updated to `n // 2` and `r` remains `n`. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `r` is updated to `n // 2`.***
