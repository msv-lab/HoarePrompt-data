### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The original program initializes `l` and `r` correctly as `0` and `n` respectively.
   - The binary search loop is also correctly implemented. It continues until `r - l <= 1`, which ensures that the search range is narrowed down to a single element.
   - The condition `if array[mid] <= find` is appropriate for moving the left pointer `l` to `mid` if the middle element is less than or equal to the target. Otherwise, it moves the right pointer `r` to `mid`.

2. **Swap Logic:**
   - The original program does not perform any actual swaps on the array. It only prints the number of swaps and the indices to swap.
   - The function `func_1` checks if the target value `find` is already at the correct position `l` after the binary search. If it is, it prints `0` and returns `None`.
   - If the target value is not at the correct position, it prints `1` and returns the indices to swap. However, it does not perform the swap itself, which is a critical flaw.

3. **Number of Swaps:**
   - The problem description states that no more than 2 swaps are allowed. The original program does not ensure this constraint. It only performs one swap if needed and does not handle the case where a second swap might be necessary.

### Example Input and Output Analysis:
- For the input:
  ```
  5
  6 3
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  6 5
  3 1 6 5 2 4
  5 1
  3 5 4 2 1
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  3 2
  3 2 1
  ```
- The original program will produce:
  ```
  0
  1
  3 4
  2
  2 4
  1 5
  2
  4 5
  2 4
  1
  1 3
  ```
- The output is partially correct but flawed because:
  - It does not perform the swaps on the array.
  - It does not ensure that the binary search works correctly after the swaps.
  - It does not handle the case where more than one swap might be necessary.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program provided in the original assessment is more accurate:
- It performs the necessary swaps on the array.
- It ensures that the binary search works correctly after the swaps.
- It handles the case where more than one swap might be necessary.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the flaws in the program. The program does not perform the swaps and does not ensure the binary search works correctly after the swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
