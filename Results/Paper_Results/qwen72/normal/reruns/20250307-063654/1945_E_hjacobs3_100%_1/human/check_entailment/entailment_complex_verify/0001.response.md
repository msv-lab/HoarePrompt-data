### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the binary search initialization is incorrect. The problem description specifies that `l` should be 1 and `r` should be `n + 1`, but the program initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`. This discrepancy will indeed cause the binary search to operate on the wrong indices, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop condition `r - l > 1` and the midpoint calculation `mid = (l + r) // 2` are correct for a binary search. However, the update conditions for `l` and `r` are based on the incorrect initial values of `l` and `r`, which will lead to incorrect behavior.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed. The problem description allows for up to 2 swaps, but the program only considers a single swap.
   - Additionally, the program does not actually perform the swaps; it only prints the indices and returns them. This is a significant issue because the problem requires the program to output the number of operations and the indices of the elements to swap, but the program does not handle the case where 2 swaps are needed.

4. **Output**:
   - The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` should return the number of operations and the indices of the elements to swap, but it only returns the indices for a single swap. This means the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it initializes the binary search indices incorrectly, does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed, and does not actually perform the swaps. These issues prevent the program from meeting the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False**
