Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, `l` is either 0 or `n // 2`, `r` is either `n` or `n // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, and `n` must be greater than 2.
- `mid` is initially `n // 2`.
- If `array[mid]` ≤ `find`, `l` is updated to `n // 2` and `r` remains `n`.
- Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `r` is updated to `n // 2`.
- The code snippet `mid = (l + r) // 2` updates the value of `mid` to the average of `l` and `r`, rounded down to the nearest integer.
- Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `mid` as `(l + r) // 2`, and the possible values of `l` and `r` based on the initial conditions.
