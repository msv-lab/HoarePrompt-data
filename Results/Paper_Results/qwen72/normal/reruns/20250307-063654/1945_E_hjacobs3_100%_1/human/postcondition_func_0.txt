The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `find`. It returns a list of two strings if `l` (the largest index such that `array[l]` â‰¤ `find`) is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`. The first string is the 1-based index of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the 1-based index of `find` in `array`. If `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`, the function prints `0` and returns `None`. The function does not modify the input `array`.
