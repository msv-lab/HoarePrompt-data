Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, and `mid` is `n // 2`. If `array[mid]` ≤ `find`, then `l` is updated to `n // 2` and `r` remains `n`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `n // 2` and `l` remains 0.***
