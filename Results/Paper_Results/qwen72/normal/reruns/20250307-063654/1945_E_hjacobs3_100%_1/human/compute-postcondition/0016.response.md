Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, `l` is now `(l + r) // 2`, `r` is either `n` or `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is updated to `mid`, which is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the initial conditions for `array`, `find`, and `n` still hold. The value of `r` is still either `n` or `n // 2` as specified in the initial state.
