Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation is incorrect. The indices `l` and `r` are initialized as `0` and `n`, respectively. However, in the problem description, `l` is initialized as `1` and `r` as `n + 1`. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of operations and the indices of the swaps, but the current implementation prints the number of operations directly, which is not in line with the expected output format.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not actually perform the swaps before running the binary search. It only prints the indices where the swaps should be made, but it does not modify the array.

4. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition in the binary search should be `r - l > 1`, but the program does not handle the case where `r - l == 1` correctly. It should end the loop when `r - l == 1`.

5. **Indexing Issue**: The program uses 0-based indexing for the array, but the problem description uses 1-based indexing. This can lead to incorrect indices being printed.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    print(res[0])
    for swap in res[1]:
        print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (1, n + 1)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if array[l - 1] == find:
        return (0, [])
    
    # Find the index of the target value
    target_index = array.index(find) + 1
    
    # Determine the number of swaps needed
    swaps = []
    if l != target_index:
        swaps.append((l, target_index))
        array[l - 1], array[target_index - 1] = array[target_index - 1], array[l - 1]
    
    # Perform the binary search again to ensure correctness
    (l, r) = (1, n + 1)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    if array[l - 1] == find:
        return (len(swaps), swaps)
    
    # If the binary search still doesn't find the target, perform another swap
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if array[i - 1] > find:
            swaps.append((i, target_index))
            array[i - 1], array[target_index - 1] = array[target_index - 1], array[i - 1]
            break
    
    return (len(swaps), swaps)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Binary Search Initialization**: The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1` to match the problem description.
2. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` now returns a tuple containing the number of swaps and a list of swap operations.
3. **Swapping Logic**: The program performs the necessary swaps before running the binary search again to ensure the correct result.
4. **Indexing**: The program uses 1-based indexing for the output, as required by the problem description.
5. **Binary Search Verification**: The program runs the binary search again after performing the swaps to verify that the target value is found correctly.

This corrected program should now work as expected for the given problem.
