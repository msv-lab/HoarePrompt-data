Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2` which is `n // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mid` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`.
- Given `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`, the new value of `mid` is `n // 2`.
- The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
