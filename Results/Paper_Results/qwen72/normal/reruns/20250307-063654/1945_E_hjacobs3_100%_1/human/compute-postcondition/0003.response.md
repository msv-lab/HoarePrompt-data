Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`.** 

The variable `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2, which results in `n // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
