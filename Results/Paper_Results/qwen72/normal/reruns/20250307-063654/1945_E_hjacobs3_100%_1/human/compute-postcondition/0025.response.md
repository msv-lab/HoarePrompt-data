The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `find`. `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ find ≤ n. The function returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` converted to a string, where `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` ≤ `find`; the second string is the value of `array.index(find) + 1` converted to a string, which is the index of `find` in `array` plus 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `find`. It returns a list of two strings: the first string is the index (1-based) of the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the 1-based index of `find` in `array`.**
