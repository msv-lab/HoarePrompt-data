### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The original function `func_1` initializes `l` and `r` correctly as `0` and `n` respectively.
   - The binary search loop is also correctly implemented: it continues as long as `r - l > 1`, and it correctly updates `l` or `r` based on the comparison of `array[mid]` with `find`.
   - However, the function does not return the correct result if the binary search finds the target value at the correct position. It should return `None` or an empty list in this case, but it prints `0` and returns `None`.

2. **Swap Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` does not actually perform any swaps on the `array`. It only prints the number of swaps and the indices to swap.
   - The function does not ensure that the number of swaps is no more than 2. It only returns a single swap if `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.
   - The function does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed to place the target value at the correct position.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program does not correctly format the output as required. It should print the number of swaps followed by the swap indices, but it only prints the number of swaps and returns the indices.

### Example Input and Output:
For the input:
```
5
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
3 2
3 2 1
```
The original program will produce incorrect output because:
- It does not perform the swaps.
- It does not correctly handle the binary search logic to ensure the target value is found at the correct position.
- It does not format the output correctly.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program should:
- Perform the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.
- Ensure that the number of swaps is no more than 2.
- Correctly format the output as required.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(len(res))
        for swap in res:
            print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    else:
        print(0)
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    swaps = []
    
    # Find the index of the target value
    target_index = array.index(find)
    
    # Perform the binary search
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # Check if the target is already at the correct position
    if l == target_index:
        return []
    
    # Perform the necessary swaps
    if array[l] != find:
        swaps.append((l + 1, target_index + 1))
        array[l], array[target_index] = array[target_index], array[l]
    
    # Perform the binary search again to check if the target is found
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # If the target is still not at the correct position, perform another swap
    if l != target_index:
        for i in range(n):
            if array[i] == find:
                swaps.append((l + 1, i + 1))
                array[l], array[i] = array[i], array[l]
                break
    
    return swaps
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct. The given program does not handle the binary search and swap logic correctly, and it does not format the output as required.

Final: **False**
