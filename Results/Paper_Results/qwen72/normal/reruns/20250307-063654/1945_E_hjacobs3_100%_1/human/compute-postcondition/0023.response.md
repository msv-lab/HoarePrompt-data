Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, and `n` must be greater than 1. After the loop finishes, `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` ≤ `find`, and `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r]` > `find`. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.**
