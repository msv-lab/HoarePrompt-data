Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the binary search and the required swaps to ensure the binary search works as intended. Specifically, the binary search logic is flawed and the swap logic is not implemented correctly.

### Case 1: Binary Search Logic
The binary search logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect. The initial values for `l` and `r` should be `0` and `n` respectively, but the program incorrectly initializes `r` to `n` and uses `mid` in a way that does not properly handle the search range.

### Case 2: Swap Logic
The program does not correctly handle the swap logic. The function `func_1` only prints the number of swaps and the indices to swap, but it does not actually perform the swaps on the array. Additionally, the function does not ensure that the number of swaps is no more than 2.

### Example Input and Output
For the input:
```
5
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
3 2
3 2 1
```
The program will produce incorrect output because it does not perform the swaps and the binary search logic is flawed.

### Corrected Program
Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(len(res))
        for swap in res:
            print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    else:
        print(0)
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    swaps = []
    
    # Find the index of the target value
    target_index = array.index(find)
    
    # Perform the binary search
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # Check if the target is already at the correct position
    if l == target_index:
        return []
    
    # Perform the necessary swaps
    if array[l] == find:
        return []
    
    # Swap the target with the element at position l
    swaps.append((l + 1, target_index + 1))
    array[l], array[target_index] = array[target_index], array[l]
    
    # Perform the binary search again to check if the target is found
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # If the target is still not at the correct position, perform another swap
    if l != target_index:
        # Find the next position to swap
        for i in range(n):
            if array[i] == find:
                swaps.append((l + 1, i + 1))
                array[l], array[i] = array[i], array[l]
                break
    
    return swaps
```

This corrected program ensures that the binary search works correctly and performs the necessary swaps to place the target value at the correct position.
