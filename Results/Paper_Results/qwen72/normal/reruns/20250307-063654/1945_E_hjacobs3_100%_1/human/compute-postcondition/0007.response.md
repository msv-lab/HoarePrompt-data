Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `array[mid]` is greater than `find`.**

The value of `r` is updated to `n // 2`, which is the same as the value of `mid`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
