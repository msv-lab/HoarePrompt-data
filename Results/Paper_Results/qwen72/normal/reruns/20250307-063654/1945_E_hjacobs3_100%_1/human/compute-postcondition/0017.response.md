Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, `l` is either 0 or `n // 2`, `r` is `mid`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to be equal to `mid`.
- The other variables (`array`, `find`, `n`, `mid`, `l`) remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `array`, `find`, and `n` are still valid.
- The value of `mid` is still calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, but now `r` is `mid`, so `mid` will be recalculated if `l` changes.
- `l` can still be either 0 or `n // 2` as specified in the initial state.
