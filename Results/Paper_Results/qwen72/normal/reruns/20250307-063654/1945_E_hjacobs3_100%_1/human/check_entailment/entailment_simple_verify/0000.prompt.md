You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the binary search and the required swaps to ensure the binary search works as intended. Specifically, the binary search logic is flawed and the swap logic is not implemented correctly.

### Case 1: Binary Search Logic
The binary search logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect. The initial values for `l` and `r` should be `0` and `n` respectively, but the program incorrectly initializes `r` to `n` and uses `mid` in a way that does not properly handle the search range.

### Case 2: Swap Logic
The program does not correctly handle the swap logic. The function `func_1` only prints the number of swaps and the indices to swap, but it does not actually perform the swaps on the array. Additionally, the function does not ensure that the number of swaps is no more than 2.

### Example Input and Output
For the input:
```
5
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
5 1
3 5 4 2 1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
3 2
3 2 1
```
The program will produce incorrect output because it does not perform the swaps and the binary search logic is flawed.

### Corrected Program
Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(len(res))
        for swap in res:
            print(' '.join(map(str, swap)))
    else:
        print(0)
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    swaps = []
    
    # Find the index of the target value
    target_index = array.index(find)
    
    # Perform the binary search
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # Check if the target is already at the correct position
    if l == target_index:
        return []
    
    # Perform the necessary swaps
    if array[l] == find:
        return []
    
    # Swap the target with the element at position l
    swaps.append((l + 1, target_index + 1))
    array[l], array[target_index] = array[target_index], array[l]
    
    # Perform the binary search again to check if the target is found
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # If the target is still not at the correct position, perform another swap
    if l != target_index:
        # Find the next position to swap
        for i in range(n):
            if array[i] == find:
                swaps.append((l + 1, i + 1))
                array[l], array[i] = array[i], array[l]
                break
    
    return swaps
```

This corrected program ensures that the binary search works correctly and performs the necessary swaps to place the target value at the correct position.
