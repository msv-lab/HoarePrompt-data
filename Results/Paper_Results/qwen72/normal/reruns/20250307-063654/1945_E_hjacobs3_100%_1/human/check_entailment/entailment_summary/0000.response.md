Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the position of a number `x` in a permutation `p` using a modified binary search algorithm. However, the program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it meets the problem's requirements:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is not entirely correct. The initial values of `l` and `r` should be `0` and `n` respectively, but the loop condition `while r - l > 1` is correct. The mid-point calculation `mid = (l + r) // 2` is also correct. However, the condition `if array[mid] <= find` should be `if array[mid] < find` to correctly narrow down the search range.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not actually perform the swaps before running the binary search. Instead, it only identifies the positions where `x` should be swapped to make the binary search work. The problem statement requires that the program can perform up to 2 swaps before running the binary search, but the program does not implement this logic.

3. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` prints the number of operations directly, which is not the correct approach. The output should be the number of operations followed by the indices of the swaps, and this should be handled outside the function.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case in a loop.

5. **Indexing Issue**: The function `func_1` returns 1-based indices, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, the comparison `if l != array.index(find)` is incorrect because `l` is a 0-based index, and `array.index(find)` is also a 0-based index. The correct comparison should be `if l + 1 != array.index(find) + 1`.

6. **Return Value**: The function `func_1` should return the number of operations and the indices of the swaps, but it only returns the indices if a swap is needed. It should return `0` if no swap is needed.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not perform the required swaps and does not handle the output format correctly.

Correctness: **False**
