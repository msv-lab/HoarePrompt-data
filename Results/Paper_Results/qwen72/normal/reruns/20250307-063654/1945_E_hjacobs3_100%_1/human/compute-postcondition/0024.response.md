Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`.
- `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`.
- `n` is the length of `array`, and `n` must be greater than 1.
- After the loop finishes, `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` ≤ `find`, and `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r]` > `find`.
- Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `0`.
- The initial state and the variables `array`, `find`, `l`, and `r` do not influence the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **0**
