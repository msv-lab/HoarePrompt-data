Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`.**

The initial state remains unchanged for `array`, `find`, and `n`. The variables `l` and `r` are now assigned the values 0 and `n` respectively.
