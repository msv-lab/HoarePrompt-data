Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`, `n` is the length of `array`, and `n` must be greater than 1. After the loop finishes, `l` is the largest index such that `array[l]` ≤ `find`, and `r` is the smallest index such that `array[r]` > `find`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `r - l > 1`, which means that `l` and `r` are not adjacent indices.
- In each iteration, the loop calculates the midpoint `mid` between `l` and `r`.
- If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` is updated to `mid`, indicating that `find` could be at or after `mid`.
- If `array[mid]` is greater than `find`, `r` is updated to `mid`, indicating that `find` must be before `mid`.
- The loop narrows down the range `[l, r)` until `r - l` is 1, which means `l` and `r` are adjacent.
- At the end of the loop, `l` will be the largest index such that `array[l]` is less than or equal to `find`, and `r` will be the smallest index such that `array[r]` is greater than `find`.
