Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
2. **Output**: For each test case, output the number of operations `k` (0 to 2) and the indices of the elements to swap.
3. **Goal**: Rearrange the permutation so that after performing binary search, `p_l` equals `x`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `array`.

2. **Binary Search Function**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to perform the binary search and determine if any swaps are needed.
   - It initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n` respectively.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `r - l` is 1.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and updates `l` or `r` based on the value at `array[mid]`.

3. **Checking the Result**:
   - After the loop, it checks if `l` is the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the index of `x`, it prints 1 and returns the indices of `l` and the actual index of `x` (both incremented by 1 to match 1-based indexing).
   - If `l` is the index of `x`, it prints 0.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search initialization is incorrect. The problem description states that `l` should be 1 and `r` should be `n + 1`, but the program initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`.
   - This will cause the binary search to operate on the wrong indices, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop condition `r - l > 1` is correct for a binary search.
   - The midpoint calculation `mid = (l + r) // 2` is also correct.
   - The update conditions for `l` and `r` are correct for a binary search, but they are based on the incorrect initial values of `l` and `r`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program attempts to swap elements if `l` is not the index of `x`.
   - However, the program does not actually perform the swap; it only prints the indices and returns them.
   - The problem requires the program to output the number of operations and the indices of the elements to swap, but the program does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of operations (0 or 1) and the indices to swap, but it does not handle the case where 2 swaps are needed.
   - The function `func_1` should return the number of operations and the indices of the elements to swap, but it only returns the indices for a single swap.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because:
- It initializes the binary search indices incorrectly.
- It does not handle the case where more than one swap is needed.
- It does not actually perform the swaps, only prints the indices.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
