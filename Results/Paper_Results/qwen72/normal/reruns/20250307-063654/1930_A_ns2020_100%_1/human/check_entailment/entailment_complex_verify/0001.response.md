### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and the goal is to perform n moves where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of these two integers to the score, and then erasing them.
   - The objective is to maximize the final score.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer. This ensures that the minimum value of each pair is the smallest possible value in the remaining set, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It then sums every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[::2]`). This is because, after sorting, the smallest elements will be at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), and these are the ones that will be added to the score when paired with the next smallest element.
   - Finally, it prints the sum, which represents the maximum score.

4. **Verification Using Annotated Code:**
   - **State Before Function Call:**
     - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
     - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
     - `A` is a list of 2n integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
   - **Inside the Function:**
     - The program reads `t` and processes `t` test cases.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `A`.
     - It sorts `A` in ascending order.
     - It sums every second element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`).
     - It prints the sum, which is the maximum score for that test case.
   - **State After Function Call:**
     - `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
     - `n` and `A` are reset for each new test case.

5. **Test Cases:**
   - **First Test Case:**
     - Input: `2 3`
     - Sorted: `2 3`
     - Sum of every second element: `2`
     - Output: `2`
     - Correct.
   - **Second Test Case:**
     - Input: `1 1 2 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 = 2`
     - Output: `2`
     - Correct.
   - **Third Test Case:**
     - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Output: `3`
     - Correct.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly:
     - `1 <= t <= 5000` (number of test cases)
     - `1 <= n <= 50` (number of pairs)
     - `1 <= a_i <= 10^7` (range of integers)
   - The sorting and summing operations are efficient and correct for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always selecting the smallest possible values to add to the score. It handles all test cases and edge cases as expected.

Final: **True**
