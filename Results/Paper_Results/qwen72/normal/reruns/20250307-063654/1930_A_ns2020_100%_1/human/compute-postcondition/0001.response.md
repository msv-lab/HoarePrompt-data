The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, which means `t` is already non-zero and within the specified range. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7**
