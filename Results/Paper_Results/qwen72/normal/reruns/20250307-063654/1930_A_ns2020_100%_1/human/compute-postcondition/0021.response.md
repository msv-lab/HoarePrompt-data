Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers from the user, sorts the list, and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` being 0. The function does not return any value. **
