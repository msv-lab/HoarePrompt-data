### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves 2n positive integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform n moves, where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of these two integers to our score, and then erasing them.
   - The goal is to maximize the final score.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer. This ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible value to the score, which is the optimal strategy because the minimum value of each pair will be the smallest possible value in the remaining set.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It then sums every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[::2]`). This is because, after sorting, the smallest elements will be at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), and these are the ones that will be added to the score when paired with the next smallest element.
   - Finally, it prints the sum, which represents the maximum score.

4. **Verification Using Annotated Code:**
   - **State Before Function Call:**
     - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
     - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
     - `A` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
   - **State After Reading Test Cases:**
     - `t` is decremented by 1 after each test case.
     - For each test case:
       - `n` is read and is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
       - `A` is read and is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
       - `A` is sorted in ascending order.
       - The sum of every second element starting from the first element is calculated and printed.
   - **State After All Test Cases:**
     - `t` is 0, and the program terminates.

5. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - **First Test Case:**
     - Input: `2 3`
     - Sorted: `2 3`
     - Sum of every second element: `2`
     - Output: `2`
     - Correct.
   - **Second Test Case:**
     - Input: `1 1 2 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 = 2`
     - Output: `2`
     - Correct.
   - **Third Test Case:**
     - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Output: `3`
     - Correct.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly:
     - `1 <= t <= 5000` (number of test cases)
     - `1 <= n <= 50` (number of pairs)
     - `1 <= a_i <= 10^7` (range of integers)
   - The sorting and summing operations are efficient and correct for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always selecting the smallest possible values to add to the score. It handles all test cases and edge cases as expected.

Final: **True**
