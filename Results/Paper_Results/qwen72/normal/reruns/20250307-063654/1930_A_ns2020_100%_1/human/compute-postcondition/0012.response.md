Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 4998, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `A` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user.** 

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `t` is `t - 1`. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `A` remain unchanged.
