Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading and Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`. It then sorts the list `A`.
3. **Summing Minimum Values**: After sorting, the program sums every other element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This approach works because, in a sorted list, the minimum value of each pair will always be the first element of the pair when the list is divided into pairs.
4. **Output**: The program prints the sum, which represents the maximum score achievable by following the described moves.

The logic of the program ensures that it always selects the minimum value of each pair, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score. This is because the sorted list guarantees that the smallest elements are paired together, and the sum of the smallest elements in each pair will be the maximum possible score.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
