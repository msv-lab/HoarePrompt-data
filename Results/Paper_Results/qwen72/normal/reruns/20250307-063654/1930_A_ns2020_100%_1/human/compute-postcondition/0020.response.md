The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `a` of 2n integers. It returns a result based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the elements in `a`.**
