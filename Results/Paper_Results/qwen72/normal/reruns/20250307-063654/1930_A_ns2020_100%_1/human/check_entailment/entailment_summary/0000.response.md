Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two integers from the list, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and then removing both integers. The key insight is that to maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest two numbers available in each step. This is because the minimum of the two numbers will be added to the score, and choosing the smallest numbers first ensures that we are not wasting larger numbers that could contribute more to the score in subsequent steps.

The provided program follows this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It prints the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2).

The reason this works is that after sorting the list, the smallest numbers will be at the beginning. By summing the elements at even indices, we are effectively summing the first number of each pair when the list is divided into pairs. This is equivalent to summing the minimum of each pair, which is the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.

Let's verify this with the given examples:
- For the first test case: `2 3`
  - Sorted: `2 3`
  - Sum of elements at even indices: `2`
  - Correct output: `2`

- For the second test case: `1 1 2 1`
  - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
  - Sum of elements at even indices: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Correct output: `2`

- For the third test case: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sum of elements at even indices: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
  - Correct output: `3`

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and produces the expected outputs for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
