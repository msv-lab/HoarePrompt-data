Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 4998, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `A` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user.** 

The list `A` has been sorted in ascending order, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
