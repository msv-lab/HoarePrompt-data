Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 4998, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `A` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `A`. The initial state specifies that `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, so after executing the code, `A` is updated to the new list of integers provided by the user. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
