You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers from the user, sorts the list, and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` being 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading and Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`. It then sorts the list `A`.
3. **Summing Minimum Values**: After sorting, the program sums every other element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This approach works because, in a sorted list, the minimum value of each pair will always be the first element of the pair when the list is divided into pairs.
4. **Output**: The program prints the sum, which represents the maximum score achievable by following the described moves.

The logic of the program ensures that it always selects the minimum value of each pair, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score. This is because the sorted list guarantees that the smallest elements are paired together, and the sum of the smallest elements in each pair will be the maximum possible score.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
