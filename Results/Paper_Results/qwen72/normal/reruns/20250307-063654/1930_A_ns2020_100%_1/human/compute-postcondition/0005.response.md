Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
- `A` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `A`**:
   - `A` is a sorted list of integers.
   - The length of `A` is 2n, where n is an integer between 1 and 50.

2. **Slicing `A`**:
   - `A[::2]` is a slice of `A` that selects every second element starting from the first element (index 0).
   - For example, if `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, then `A[::2]` will be `[1, 3, 5]`.

3. **Summing the Sliced Elements**:
   - `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of the elements selected by the slice `A[::2]`.
   - Continuing the example, `sum([1, 3, 5])` would be 9.

### Conclusion:
The `print(sum(A[::2]))` statement will print the sum of every second element in the sorted list `A`, starting from the first element.

### Final Output:
Output: **sum of every second element in the sorted list `A` starting from the first element** (where the sum is the total of the elements at even indices in the sorted list `A`).

This output is the most precise description based on the given initial state and the code snippet.
