Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 4998\).
   - `n` is a new input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `a` is a list of \(2n\) integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
   - `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum(A[::2]))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The list `A` is sorted.
   - The slicing operation `A[::2]` selects every second element from the sorted list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0).
   - The `sum` function then calculates the sum of these selected elements.
   - The `print` statement outputs this sum.

4. **Output**:
   - Since the exact values of the elements in `A` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical sum.
   - However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **sum of the elements at even indices in the sorted list `A` (where `A` is a sorted list of \(2n\) integers provided by the user)**
