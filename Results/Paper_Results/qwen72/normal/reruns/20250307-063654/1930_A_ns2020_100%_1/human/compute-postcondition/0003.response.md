Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `A` is a list of integers input by the user.** 

The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `A`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
