Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, which must be between 1 and 50, inclusive. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
