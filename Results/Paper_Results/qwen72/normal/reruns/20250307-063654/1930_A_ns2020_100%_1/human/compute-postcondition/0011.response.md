Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 4999.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
- `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `A`**:
   - `A` is a sorted list of integers. The sorting ensures that the elements are in non-decreasing order.
   - The length of `A` is 2n, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50.

2. **Slicing `A[::2]`**:
   - The slicing operation `A[::2]` selects every second element from the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0).
   - For example, if `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, then `A[::2]` will be `[1, 3, 5]`.

3. **Summing the Sliced List**:
   - The `sum` function calculates the sum of the elements in the sliced list `A[::2]`.
   - For the example `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the sum of `A[::2]` is `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the sum of every second element in the sorted list `A`, starting from the first element.

Since the exact values of `A` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) of the sorted list `A`.

Output: **sum of every second element in the sorted list `A`, starting from the first element**.
