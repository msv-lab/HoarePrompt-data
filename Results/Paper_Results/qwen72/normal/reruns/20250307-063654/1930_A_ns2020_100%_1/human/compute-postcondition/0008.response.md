Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 4999, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `A` is a sorted list of integers input by the user**

The value of `n` has been updated to a new input integer, but the constraints for `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) still apply. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `A`) remain unchanged and retain their initial states.
