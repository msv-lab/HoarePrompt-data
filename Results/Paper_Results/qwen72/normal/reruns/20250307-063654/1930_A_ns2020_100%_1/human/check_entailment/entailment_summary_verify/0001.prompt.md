You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers from the user, sorts the list, and prints the sum of the elements at even indices. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` being 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have 2n positive integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform n moves, where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of these two integers to our score, and then erasing them.
   - The goal is to maximize the final score.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer. This ensures that we are always adding the smallest possible value to the score, which is the optimal strategy because the minimum value of each pair will be the smallest possible value in the remaining set.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It then sums every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[::2]`). This is because, after sorting, the smallest elements will be at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), and these are the ones that will be added to the score when paired with the next smallest element.
   - Finally, it prints the sum, which represents the maximum score.

4. **Verification:**
   - **First Test Case:**
     - Input: `2 3`
     - Sorted: `2 3`
     - Sum of every second element: `2`
     - Output: `2`
     - Correct.
   - **Second Test Case:**
     - Input: `1 1 2 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 = 2`
     - Output: `2`
     - Correct.
   - **Third Test Case:**
     - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Output: `3`
     - Correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly:
     - `1 <= t <= 5000` (number of test cases)
     - `1 <= n <= 50` (number of pairs)
     - `1 <= a_i <= 10^7` (range of integers)
   - The sorting and summing operations are efficient and correct for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always selecting the smallest possible values to add to the score. It handles all test cases and edge cases as expected.
