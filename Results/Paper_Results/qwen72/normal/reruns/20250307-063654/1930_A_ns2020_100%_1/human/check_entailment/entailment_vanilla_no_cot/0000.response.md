Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
2. **Reading Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `A`.
3. **Sorting the List**: The list `A` is sorted in ascending order.
4. **Calculating the Score**: The program calculates the sum of the elements at even indices of the sorted list `A` (i.e., `A[::2]`). This is because, in a sorted list, the minimum value of each pair will be at the even indices when the list is considered in pairs.
5. **Output**: The calculated score is printed for each test case.

The logic of the program is based on the observation that to maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest available number with the next smallest number. By sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices, you ensure that you are always taking the smaller number from each pair, which maximizes the score.

This approach is optimal and the program correctly implements it. Therefore, the program is correct.
