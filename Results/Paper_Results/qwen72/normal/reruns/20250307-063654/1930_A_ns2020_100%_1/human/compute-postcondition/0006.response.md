Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 4999, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `A` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.**

The value of `t` is decreased by 1, so the new value of `t` is within the range 0 to 4999. The values of `n`, `a`, and `A` remain unchanged.
