Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 4997, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `A` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it now ranges from 0 to 4997. The values of `n`, `a`, and `A` remain unchanged.
