Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Reading and Sorting**: For each test case, the program reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers `A`. It then sorts the list `A`. Sorting the list is a crucial step because it ensures that the smallest elements are considered first, which is necessary for the optimal score calculation.

3. **Summing Minimum Values**: After sorting, the program sums every other element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This approach is correct because, in a sorted list, the minimum value of each pair will always be the first element of the pair when the list is divided into pairs. By summing these elements, the program effectively adds the minimum value of each pair to the score.

4. **Output**: The program prints the sum, which represents the maximum score achievable by following the described moves. This output is correct and matches the expected results for the given examples.

5. **Optimality**: The strategy of summing the minimum values of each pair in a sorted list is indeed optimal. This is because the sorted list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, and the sum of the smallest elements in each pair will be the maximum possible score.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases correctly. For example, if all elements are the same, the program will sum the first half of the sorted list, which is correct. If the elements are distinct, the program will still correctly sum the minimum values of each pair.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program is logically sound and handles all potential inputs correctly. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
