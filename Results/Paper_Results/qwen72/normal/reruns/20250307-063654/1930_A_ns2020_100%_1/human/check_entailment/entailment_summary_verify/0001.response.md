### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the score by performing `n` moves, each time selecting two integers from a list of `2n` integers, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and then removing them from the list.
   - The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer. This ensures that the minimum value added to the score is as large as possible.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - By sorting the list of integers, we can ensure that the smallest elements are paired together. After sorting, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) will be the smallest elements in each pair, and thus, the sum of these elements will be the maximum possible score.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It then sums every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[::2]`). This is because, after sorting, the smallest elements will be at the even indices, and these are the ones that will be added to the score when paired with the next smallest element.
   - Finally, it prints the sum, which represents the maximum score.

4. **Verification:**
   - **First Test Case:**
     - Input: `2 3`
     - Sorted: `2 3`
     - Sum of every second element: `2`
     - Output: `2`
     - Correct.
   - **Second Test Case:**
     - Input: `1 1 2 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 = 2`
     - Output: `2`
     - Correct.
   - **Third Test Case:**
     - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sorted: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
     - Sum of every second element: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
     - Output: `3`
     - Correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly:
     - `1 <= t <= 5000` (number of test cases)
     - `1 <= n <= 50` (number of pairs)
     - `1 <= a_i <= 10^7` (range of integers)
   - The sorting and summing operations are efficient and correct for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always selecting the smallest possible values to add to the score. It handles all test cases and edge cases as expected.

Final: **True**
