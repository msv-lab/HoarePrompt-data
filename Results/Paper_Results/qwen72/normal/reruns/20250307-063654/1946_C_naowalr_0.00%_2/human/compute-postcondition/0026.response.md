Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50000, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
