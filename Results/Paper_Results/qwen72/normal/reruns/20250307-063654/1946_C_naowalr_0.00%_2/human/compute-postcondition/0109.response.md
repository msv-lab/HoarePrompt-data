Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001.** 

The value of `x` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2, which results in 50001. All other variables remain unchanged.
