Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `L` is the largest integer such that the number of cuts `numCuts` required to make the leftover value less than `L` is less than or equal to `k`, and `R` is `L + 1`.**
