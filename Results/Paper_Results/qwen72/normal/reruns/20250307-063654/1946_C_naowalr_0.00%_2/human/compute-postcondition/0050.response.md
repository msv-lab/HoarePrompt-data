Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements.**

The value of `i` remains 0, and `n` is still greater than 0. The integers `a` and `b` are read from the input, and the list `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements. Other variables are not affected.
