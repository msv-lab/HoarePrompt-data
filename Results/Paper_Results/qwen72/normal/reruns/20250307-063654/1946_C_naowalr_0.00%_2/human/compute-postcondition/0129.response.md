Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1`, `R` is now `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `R` is updated to be `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The condition `R - L > 1` is still valid, but the new value of `R` might affect this condition in subsequent iterations.
