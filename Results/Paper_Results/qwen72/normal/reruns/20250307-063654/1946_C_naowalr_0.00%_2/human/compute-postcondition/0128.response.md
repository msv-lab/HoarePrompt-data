Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1`, `L` is now `(L + R) // 2`.** 

The value of `L` is updated to the midpoint of `L` and `R`, which is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
