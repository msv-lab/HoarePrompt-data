Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element.**

The code `adj[a].append(b)` adds `b` to the list `adj[a]`. The initial state already mentioned that `adj[a]` contains `b` as an additional element, so this part of the state remains unchanged. The other parts of the state (`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, and `adj[b]` contains `a` as an additional element) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
