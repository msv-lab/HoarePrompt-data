Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the value returned by the `dfs(1, 1)` function, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`).**

The value of `R` is updated to 50001, which is the same as the value of `x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
