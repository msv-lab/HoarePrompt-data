Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements.**

The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
