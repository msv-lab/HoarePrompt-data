Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = (L + R) // 2` updates the value of `x` to the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `x` and all other initial conditions.
