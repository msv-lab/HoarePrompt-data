Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will have the value `n - 2`, which is the final value after the loop has run `n - 1` times.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- The variables `a` and `b` will hold the last pair of integers read from the input.
- The list `adj[a]` will contain all the `b` values that were read from the input during the loop's execution.
- The list `adj[b]` will contain all the `a` values that were read from the input during the loop's execution.
