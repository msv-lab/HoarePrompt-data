Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50000.**

The code snippet `x = (L + R) // 2` calculates the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the value of `x` becomes 50000. All other variables remain unchanged.
