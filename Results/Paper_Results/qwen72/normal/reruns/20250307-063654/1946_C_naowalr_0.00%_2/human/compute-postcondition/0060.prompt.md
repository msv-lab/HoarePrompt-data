Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `L` is the largest integer such that the number of cuts `numCuts` required to make the leftover value less than `L` is less than or equal to `k`, and `R` is `L + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj[a].append(b)
    adj[b].append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements (with `b` appended again), `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements (with `a` appended again).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements (with `b` appended twice), `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements (with `a` appended twice).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
