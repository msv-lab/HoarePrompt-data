The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` must be less than `n - 1`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a]`, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers**
