To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition: `R - L > 1`.

### Initial State:
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001

### Loop Condition:
- The loop will execute if `R - L > 1`.

### Calculation:
- `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`

### Conclusion:
- Since `100000 > 1`, the loop condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied with the given initial values of `L` and `R`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
