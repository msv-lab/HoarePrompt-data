Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L` must be greater than 1, `R` is `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `R` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `x`, `leftover`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `R - L` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
