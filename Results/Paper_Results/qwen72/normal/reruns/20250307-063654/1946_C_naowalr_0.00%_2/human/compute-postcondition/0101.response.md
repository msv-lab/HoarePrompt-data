Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element, and `a` has been appended to `adj[b]`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin`, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first part to `a` and the second part to `b`.
- The values of `a` and `b` are now updated to the input integers.
- The initial state variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The conditions regarding `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain valid as the code snippet does not affect these conditions.
