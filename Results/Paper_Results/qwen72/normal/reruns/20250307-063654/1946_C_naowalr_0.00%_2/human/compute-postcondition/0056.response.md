The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` must be less than `n - 1`).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements (with `b` appended again), `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements (with `a` appended again)**
