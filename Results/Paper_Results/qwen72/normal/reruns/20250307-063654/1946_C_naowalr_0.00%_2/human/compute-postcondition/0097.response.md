Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element.**

The code reads a line from standard input, splits it into two integers, and assigns these integers to `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now the input integers. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
