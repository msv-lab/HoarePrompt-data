Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the value returned by the `dfs(1, 1)` function.** 

The `dfs(1, 1)` function is called, and the value it returns is stored in the variable `leftover`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
