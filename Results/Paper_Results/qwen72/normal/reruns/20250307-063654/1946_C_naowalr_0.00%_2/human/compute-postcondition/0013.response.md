Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a, a]`, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values read from input.**

In natural language: The initial state remains mostly unchanged, except that the variables `a` and `b` are now updated to new integer values read from the input. All other variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
