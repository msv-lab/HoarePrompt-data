Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a]`, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`.
- Initially, `adj[b]` was an empty list, so after the code execution, `adj[b]` contains `[a]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
- The list `adj` still has `n + 1` elements, but now `adj[a]` contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a]`.
