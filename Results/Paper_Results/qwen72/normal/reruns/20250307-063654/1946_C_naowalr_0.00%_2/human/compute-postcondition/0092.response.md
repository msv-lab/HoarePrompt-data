The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to execute correctly.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
