Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R` is `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `R` is updated to `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
