To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `R - L > 1`.

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `n` is the same as the initial `n`
- `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input
- `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input
- `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001
- `numCuts` is 0

The only variables in the loop head are `L` and `R`. The loop will execute if `R - L > 1`.

Let's evaluate the current state:
- `L` is 1
- `R` is 100001

Calculating `R - L`:
- `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`

Since `100000 > 1`, the condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
