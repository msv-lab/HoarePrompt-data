The only objects in the loop head are the variable `z` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer read from standard input and is constrained by 1 <= t <= 10^4, it is already guaranteed to be a positive integer. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `z` will start at 0 before the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer read from standard input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0**
