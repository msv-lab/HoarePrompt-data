Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `x` is the result of `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `L` is assigned to be equal to `x`.
- The value of `x` is the result of the expression `(L + R) // 2`, but since `L` and `R` were not explicitly defined in the initial state, `x` retains its previous value.
- All other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `leftover`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged.
