Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as an additional element, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element, and `a` has been appended to `adj[b]`.**

In natural language: The initial state remains mostly unchanged, with `i` still being 1, `n` still being greater than 2, and `a` and `b` still being input integers. The list `adj[a]` still contains `b` as an additional element. However, the list `adj[b]` now contains `a` as an additional element, and `a` has been appended to `adj[b]` again, meaning `a` appears twice in `adj[b]`.
