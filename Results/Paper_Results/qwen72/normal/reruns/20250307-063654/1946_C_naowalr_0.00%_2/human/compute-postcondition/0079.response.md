Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is `(L + R) // 2` and `R` is the same as the initial `R`. Otherwise, `R` is `(L + R) // 2` and `L` is the same as the initial `L`.***
