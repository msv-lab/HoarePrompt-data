Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

The value of `L` is updated to 50001, which is the value of `x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
