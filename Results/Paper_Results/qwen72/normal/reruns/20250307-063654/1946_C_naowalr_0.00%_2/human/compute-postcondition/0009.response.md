Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a]`, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values read from input.**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now updated to the new integers read from the input. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
