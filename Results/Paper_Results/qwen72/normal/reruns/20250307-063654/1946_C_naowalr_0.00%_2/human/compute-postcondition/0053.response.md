Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements, `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements.**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the relationships between `a`, `b`, and the `adj` list remain as specified in the initial state.
