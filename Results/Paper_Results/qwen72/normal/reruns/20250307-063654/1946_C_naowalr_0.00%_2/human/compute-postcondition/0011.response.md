Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b, b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a, a]`, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values read from input.**

The value of `adj[b]` is updated to include an additional element `a`, making it `[a, a]`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
