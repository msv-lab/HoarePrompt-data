Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements (with `b` appended again), `adj[b]` now contains `a` as one of its elements (with `a` appended again)**

The values of `a` and `b` are now updated to the integers read from the input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
