Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` (for all pairs of integers `a` and `b` read from input) contains the corresponding `b` and `a` values respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input, `x` is the result of `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `numCuts` is 0, `R` is at least `L + 2`.**

The code snippet `numCuts = 0` explicitly sets the variable `numCuts` to 0, which is already the case in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `numCuts` remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
