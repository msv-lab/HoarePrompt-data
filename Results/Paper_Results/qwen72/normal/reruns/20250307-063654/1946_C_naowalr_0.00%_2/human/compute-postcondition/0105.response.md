Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `L` is 1.**

The code snippet `L = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `L`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `L` being 1.
