To determine what will be printed by the `print(L)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues to execute until `R - L <= 1`. This means that the loop will stop when `R` and `L` are either equal or `R` is one more than `L`.

2. **Final State**: When the loop stops, `L` and `R` will be adjacent integers, i.e., `R - L == 1` or `R == L`.

3. **Unchanged Variables**: The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `n`, `adj[a]`, and `adj[b]` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop.

Given these conditions, the final value of `L` will be one of the two adjacent integers that satisfy the condition `R - L <= 1`. Since the exact initial values of `L` and `R` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `L` at the end of the loop. However, we know that `L` will be one of the two integers that are either equal or adjacent to each other.

Output: **L (where L is one of the two adjacent integers that satisfy the condition R - L <= 1)**
