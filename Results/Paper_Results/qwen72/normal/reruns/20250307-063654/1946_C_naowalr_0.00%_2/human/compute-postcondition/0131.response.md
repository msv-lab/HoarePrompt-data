Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until `R - L <= 1`. At this point, `L` and `R` will be adjacent integers, and the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `n`, `adj[a]`, and `adj[b]` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The final values of `L` and `R` will depend on the conditions evaluated in each iteration, but they will be such that `R - L <= 1`.**

In natural language, the loop will keep narrowing the gap between `L` and `R` by repeatedly calculating the midpoint `x` and adjusting `L` or `R` based on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover`. The loop will stop when `R` and `L` are either the same or adjacent integers, meaning the difference between them is 1 or less. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n`, as well as the lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]`, will remain the same as they are not altered within the loop. The final values of `L` and `R` will be the result of the binary search-like process, where `L` and `R` converge to the optimal solution based on the conditions checked in each iteration.
