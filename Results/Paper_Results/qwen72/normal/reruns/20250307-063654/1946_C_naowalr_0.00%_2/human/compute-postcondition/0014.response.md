Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists except `adj[a]` which now contains `[b, b, b]` and `adj[b]` which now contains `[a, a]`, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values read from input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t`, `z`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values read from input.
- The list `adj[a]` initially contains `[b, b]`. After executing `adj[a].append(b)`, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, b]`.
- The list `adj[b]` remains `[a, a]` as it is not modified by the code snippet.
