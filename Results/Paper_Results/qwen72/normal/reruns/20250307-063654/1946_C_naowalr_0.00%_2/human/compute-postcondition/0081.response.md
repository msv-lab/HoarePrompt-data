Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the same as the initial `n`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the value returned by the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L` must be greater than 1**

The value of `x` is updated to be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
