Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1`**

The code snippet `numCuts = 0` reassigns the value of `numCuts` to 0, but since `numCuts` was already 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
