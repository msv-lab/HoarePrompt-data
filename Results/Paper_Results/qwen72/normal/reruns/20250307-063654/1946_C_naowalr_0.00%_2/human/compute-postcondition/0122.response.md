Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `adj[a]` now contains all the `b` values read from the input, `adj[b]` now contains all the `a` values read from the input, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `R` is `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `R` is updated to `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
