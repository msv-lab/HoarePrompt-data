The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and should start at 0 for the loop to execute correctly.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `z` is 1
- `n` is the first integer read from input
- `k` is the second integer read from input
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input
- `L` is the largest integer such that the number of cuts `numCuts` required to make the leftover value less than `L` is less than or equal to `k`
- `R` is `L + 1`

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
