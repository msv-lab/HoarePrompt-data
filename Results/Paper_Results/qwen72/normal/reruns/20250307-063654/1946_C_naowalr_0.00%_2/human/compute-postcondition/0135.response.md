Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads a series of test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the maximum number of cuts `k`, constructs an adjacency list `adj` representing a tree with `n` vertices, and then performs a binary search to find the largest integer `L` such that the number of cuts required to make the leftover value less than `L` is less than or equal to `k`. The function prints this value `L` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
